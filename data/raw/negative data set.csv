M,Solo traveler,Luxury Rooms,"バワ建築好きなので、ゆっくりしたいと3泊しました。部屋も素敵だったし、ご飯も美味しかったし、ビーチも目の前で、滞在自体は満足のいくものでした。
しかし、それを台無しにする残念なことがありました。
１つは、滞在が週末だったため、とにかくうるさかった事。隣の部屋では、若い男女が10人以上で、爆音の音楽かけたり、バルコニーで騒いだりしていて、注意してもらってもまた騒ぐという感じでした。プールも若者のグループや家族連れで騒がしいので、ゆっくり過ごしたい人は、週末は避けた方がいいと思います。
あと、支払を現地払いにしていたのですが、チェックイン時に請求された金額と、Agodaで予約した時の金額が異なったので、チェックアウト時に確認したのですが、係りの人は「間違いありません」の一点張りでした。急いでいたのもあり、あとはAgodaに間に入ってもらって、話をしてもらいますと伝えて、ホテルを出ようとしたら、他のスタッフが調べるので時間をくれと言って来ました。結局、ホテル側のミスであることが判明しましたが、予約管理も出来てないのかな？と、気分が悪いままホテルを後にしました。

first, it was so noisy because i stayed on weekends. in the next room there were more than 10 young men and women playing loud music and making noises on the balcony, and even after being warned, they made another fuss. the pool is also noisy with young people groups and families, so if you want to spend your time relaxing, it's best to avoid it on weekends.
also, i had paid on-site, but the amount charged at check-in was different from the amount i booked at agoda, so i checked it when i checked out, but the staff member was saying ""there's no doubt about it."" i was in a hurry, so i told agoda that i would come in and talk to him, and when i was about to leave the hotel, the other staff asked me to give me some time to check on it. in the end, it turned out to be a mistake on the hotel, but perhaps they can't manage their reservations either. i left the hotel feeling unwell.

Jenny,United Kingdom,Group,The perfect end to our trip around Sri Lanka,6/22/2025,"My husband and I stayed here with friends for four nights after we had been travelling around Sri Lanka. We ended up staying at the hotel for pretty much our whole four days there as we were enjoying relaxing and also there were government enforced curfews and things were difficult at that time.

The hotel was large but because the staff were super nice so it always felt intimate. I was 5 months pregnant and always felt well looked after and cared for by the staff.

Our room and bathroom was large with lovely character and a balcony. The rooms varied in size but all were comfortable. The rooms were well equipped with everything we needed and anything extra we just called reception for and they were very happy to come and sort anything. Our Aircon stopped working at 4am and a maintenance person came up immediately to look at it. Namal did a wonderful job freshening up our room every day, and we were always excited to see what creative bed decorations he'd left for each of us after breakfast.

The breakfast was very good.
We ate lunch at the pool bar every day and dinner at the restaurant every evening - these both had outside areas so we were able to always be outside. The food was good and a good price, but the menu was a little small to eat there every day!

We enjoyed both pools very much. We played table tennis and tennis, but the net took a couple of days to be put up (it was in town being serviced) and there were only two rackets.

We used the laundry service which was great and a very good price.

We all had massages which were wonderful and the therapists were lovely, but it was expensive.

The hotel provided a room for our driver for free and offered his meals for around £1 a meal, so obviously we were able to pay for that.","There were lots of dogs around that followed you to your room - I am afraid of dogs so it made me very nervous when I was walking around on my own.

The territory is pretty green and provides a lot of natural shade, saving you from sunburn.
Massage in the Spa was good.
The room we were in was pretty spacious and featured a beautiful view over one of the pools and a little ""chunk"" of the ocean.

I travelled through over 40 countries, and nowhere did I see the personnel so chilled - but not in a good way :) 
Restaurant & bar team easily forgets your order, and even when they don't, you can wait for a simple coffee in a bar with 2 tables occupied for over 0.5 hour. They  graciously add someone else's drinks to your bill (8 glasses of wine instead of actual 2? easy!) Moreover, some of them literally beg for tips, and when you tip them, it doesn't mean the service becomes any better.

On the same evening we asked for refill of water, coffee and tea in the room (we didn't get a refill on that day, so we called the reception to ask for it as they themselves advised us to do), but instead a boy came with a brewed coffee charged extra...

The room keys didn't work on one day, so we had to go all the way back to the reception to then be escorted back to the room by the maintenance guy who spent quite some time fixing the issue. Oh, and as for maintenance, you simply can't be left in peace here - e.g., laundry man barbarically opens your door even with the DND sign on...
Last but not least, on arrival, my bank card didn't work, while on the check-out it did. Quite strange. Luckily we had another card.

Замечательные очень большие бассейны. Их целых два на огромной территории. 
Тишина, никакой музыки. Постояльцы в основном люди в возрасте. Идеально для спокойного отпуска.
Еда в ресторане хорошая (но дорого). 
Первая линия. Океан прямо перед глазами.","Огромные неуютные пространства внутри отеля. Километровые пустые коридоры. Все, что за пределами номера как будто в запустении. Сам по себе отель (не считая опять-таки комнат) производит впечатление старого советского пансионата, руководство которого осталось где-то в 80-х

Раздутый персонал. Десятки людей мельтешат туда - сюда, но толково помочь с конкретным вопросом они не могут. На ресепшне нас регистрировало 8 человек (!). Между ними был бардак и неразбериха. В итоге мы ждали 40 мин, чтобы отсунировали наши паспорта и дали оплатить комнаты. 

Нет оборудованной зоны на пляже. Отель стоит на первой линии и имеет прямой выход к океану, но территория для отдыха не оборудована. Нет лежаков, зонтиков, урн, охраны. Просто сеточный забор заканчивается и дальше иди себе сам на песок. Может кому-то такой дикий вариант и по душе, но я не смогла сидеть спокойно и читать на песке, потому что ко мне приставали все проходящие мимо мутные личности. Пяти минут не давали спокойно посидеть. Кто-то все время что-то продавал, предлагал, хотел поболтать и тд. Если бы отель огородил свою территорию, такого не было бы.

I had high expectations when visiting Ahungalla Heritance (part of the Aitken Spence chain), but the food quality was a major disappointment. The lunch buffet was underwhelming, with most dishes lacking salt and flavor. The fried rice, made with samba rice, was a poor choice and didn’t complement the rest of the dishes at all.

Tea-time snacks were no better—minimal variety and nothing appetizing or memorable. We even raised our concerns with the chefs, but unfortunately, there was no noticeable improvement.

PorgeHampshire,,Couples,Popular and busy hotel with locals. A bit tired.,6/25/2025,"This was the last stop on a busy 2-week Group Tour of Sri Lanka. It was our least favourite hotel. It looks tired in places. 
We had a spacious ground floor room with a small triangular shaped bathroom. The shower doors looked in need of a good clean. Our patio doors we discovered hadn't been locked properly so anyone could have pushed them open. In the early hours of the first morning we heard 2 distinctive taps on the patio doors which was unnerving. We didn't get up to investigate but whilst the hotel is behind gates and security at the front it seemed to me that there was nothing stopping anyone wandering in off the beach area.
This hotel is very popular with locals especially at weekends so when we arrived the hotel was packed with a large group of young men playing volleyball in the main pool. All sunbeds were taken by families sitting round chatting. As this was the only day of R & R part on our trip it was a bit concerning but by Sunday afternoon things had quietened down.
This is a very large busy hotel so breakfast was a bun fight and it took us 10-15 minutes to get served tea or coffee.
Nice outside seating area by one of the bars. 
As you are nearer Colombo you will get pestered on the beach to buy things.
The sea was too rough to swim in and there are dangerous rip tides.
There is nothing to do locally but we did visit the Victor Hasselblad Sea Turtle Research And Conservation Centre just 3 miles up the road. Well worth an hour's visit to see the wonderful work they are doing.  None of the multiple hotel staff hanging around reception had heard of it even though it is literally up the same road. But a taxi driver Googled it for us and took us there and back. 
The Hotel is off one busy road with shops and other Hotels but not in a specially pretty area. 
This area was impacted by the tsunami so you will see little graveyards and monuments in memory of people who lost their lives. Especially on the train that got swept off the track.","I wouldn't recommend booking this hotel. It is aimed at locals more and is a bit tired.

wendulina,,Family,1st time in Sri Lanka- And what an experience,7/24/2025,"We stayed in Heritance Hotel for couple of weeks in mid June 2024.
We are family of 3 and this was our 1st Holiday in Sri Lanka. On arrival to the hotel we were greeted in very friendly way by lovely staff. Our room was amazing- The biggest we ever had on this kind of Holiday. The bathroom was also big and we always had plenty of fresh towels and toiletries. 
Hotel is very environmentally friendly and what we loved was that everything in the bathroom was plastic free. 
 One of the 1st things we noticed about the hotel was just cleaned and well maintained it was. The gardens were well tended too- The gardener would always prepare fresh bouquet of flowers and through it directly to us in the morning on the balcony... such a nice gesture
2 swimming pools were always clean and watched by professional staff - we actually witnessed couple of emergencies - The staff was well trained and attended without delay. In both instances it was resolved quickly and successfully

Other Hotel  staff were extremely hard working-  you could not ask for nicer bunch. We had Raveesha and Kalinga among others looking after us at the bar most of the evenings-  most hard working people I ever met. Always smiling , would literally go over and beyond to make sure our Holiday would go smoothly
In the evening we had Duminda in charge looking after us in the restaurant- Again- what a hard working- always smiling person !  He also advised us on local area and which places best to visit to make our Holiday extra special
In the restaurant we could not be be more happy with selection of food. Hotel was very quiet some days due to low season and we would be served at the table- There was always interesting , tasty food on the menu. The days when hotel got busy and restaurant was running at 100% it was packed with delicious fresh food. We love tasting local cuisine and we were spoiled for choice. 
During the days we tried to explore Sri Lanka and on our returns we often felt like returning home- greeted as family in most friendly manner. We were even invited to be part of the Poya celebration which was organized by hotel for the local people
It was absolute pleasure to spend 2 weeks here and we are very grateful to all hardworking staff for looking after us.

WellTravelled321,"Manchester, United Kingdom",Family,"Very dissapointing stay here, wouldn’t stay here again.",4/24/2025,"This is meant to be a 5 star hotel, but is lacking in so many areas.

The positives first. The restaurant staff and room cleaning staff were excellent.  The rooms are very nice, spacious and beds are extremely comfortable.

Unfortunately the reception staff and management were extremely unhelpful and didn’t address issues when highlighted.

We visited during Sri Lankan new year and we knew shops and restaurants would be closed, we asked the reception staff and were advised Fri and sat (which is what we expected) I also asked if they knew if restaurants in Galle would be open on the Sunday and was advised they would all be closed as still new year so better to stay at the hotel. This was incorrect as a discovered through a Facebook forum and visited Galle on the Sunday were all restaurants were open. This felt like an attempt to keep you in the hotel spending money.

The prices at the hotel were also questionable. The hotel we stayed in the week before had clear pricing on there menu  eg Nani goreng 1800 Sri Lankan rupees.  The heritance menu do 10% state service charge to be added, but also to be added is 18% vat meaning the prices stated which were already at least 20% higher than the previous 5star rated hotel we had stayed in were much more costly than other similarly rated hotels and more concerningly this isn’t clear.

The pools open at 8am which is fine as they need to clean them, but the bed cover and towels aren’t available until 8am and as I am an early riser and like to get up and spend some time in the sun before breakfast and the sun gets too hot this was disappointing. Also out of the 5 nights we stayed here I had to trek around the resort on 3 separate days to find a pool attendant as you can’t get the mattress and towels yourself, having gone to reception on 2 occasions it took until 9 am on 2 of the days to get the towels and mattresses, and all the manager Clive could do was apologise, which given it happened again the following morning was very poor. The issue clearly hadn’t been addressed. Also around the pool, wasn’t cleaned with cigarette ends (dissapointing that’s scruffy guests leave this is the first place) plastic bottles and beer caps left on the grass for the last 4 days we were there. 

I would not recommend this hotel to stay at and instead would highly recommend the 5 star Taj Bentota which is only 20 minutes away and is excellent with much more around the hotel as well which if you want to explore is great.",,en,negative,en,negative,unknown,unknown,"very dissapointing stay here, wouldn’t stay here again.","this is meant to be a 5 star hotel, but is lacking in so many areas.

Shereen,,,Average experience.. Needs improvements to keep up with other five start hotels,4/23/2025,"Well The overall experience is not bad.. The two Pools were clean, big and had a good time swimming.. But the Jacuzzi pools were not clean.. Was very unpleasant to get in.. staff is friendly and supportive, except the staff in the buffet area.. Its like they are annoyed with the guests who are dining there..  One girl poured water to the glass until its over flowed.. She apologised but ddnt have enough time to clean it for us she got occupied with something else.. I dont blame her, But the hotel management becauae it seemed like they were over worked the shifts.. Some of them were exhausted and unable to provide the service as expected by the guests paid for a pleasant dining time.. Poor service from taking away the finished plates to filling up the finished dishes.. Buffet was average in my opinion, food is good, considerable amount of variety was there.. but i hope they can improve a lil bit more when it comes to buffet and dining.. 

Apart from that the stay was satisfying.. We booked  a premium delux room.. Which was spacious and clean.. But the bed was uncomfortable.. I expected for the bathrooms to be cleaner and more pleasant looking for a five start hotel..  Heard complaints from the guests in deluxe rooms.. So make sure to book higher rooms..

I recommend this hotel for a get away with avarage expectations.. Surely not upto five star standards specially compared to herritance kandalama..

But unfortunately this was not the case. With the exception of the reception staff who was very friendly and efficient, the rest was below the average, especially at the main restaurant. On more than one occasion had to make exaggerated gestures to catch the waiters’ attention and had to repeat our order of water and or coffee during breakfast and dinner.

Wonderful big comfortable bed, excellent rain shower, big flat screen TV, minbar, generous safe and covered private balcony.

Public areas are open plan and also look very nice - until you spot the package operator signs & programs, hear the scream of children in the pool (right beside the only bar & lounge) and realise the predominant language is Russian.

Service is hit and miss - there are some excellent staff who cannot do enough to please, but there is also a lot of inexperience and a shortage of staff for the number of guests - leading to some extremely poor service experiences (eg. Wine ordered  at dinner not arriving until after dessert; dirty plates left on tables for long periods; tables not properly cleaned between use; buffet dishes not replenished; etc.)

The food quality in the buffet is poor - tough cuts of meat, over cooked curries and left out/not refreshed very often.  Even at the fresh food stations the ingredients were not top quality and over cooked - and at best all the dishes are luke warm. Breakfast was no better - some good curries, but otherwise heavy doughy croissants, ‘butter’ that was in fact margarine, a couple of cheap jams, limited selection of fruit and one person cooking eggs and another cooking hoppers for the 100s of guests.

To round it off - the majority of the wine list was unavailable (excuse being difficulty with supply chain due to pandemic - but the other hotels on our tour hadn’t suffered the same problems), as were a number of items on the pool bar snack menu.

We stopped here for the last week of our 2 week trip to Sri Lanka for our honeymoon and on arrival to the hotel from the lobby/main gates it looked exceptional! On arrival to our “deluxe” room we were instantly disappointed. The room apparently had just been refurbished which I found really hard to believe. The shower was covered in limescale and the room was tiny. After a bit of a battle we were finally allocated another room. This room was slightly bigger but the bathroom was once again the bathroom was again covered in limescale, half decorated, very basic and we couldn’t see anything deluxe or 5 star about it. Earlier in the week we stayed in a deluxe room at a sister hotel ‘Heritance Kandalama’ and the room there had an amazing view, whirlpool bath & amazing decor… so as you can imagine we were really disappointed with this room. I’ve attached a couple of photos for reference too.

The food was really really good at the buffet and snack bar and we thought the verity of alcohol provided on the all inclusive was good. The staff were friendly but there wasn’t enough staff and they couldn’t keep up with how many people were there. 

I personally wouldn’t recommend to anyone looking for luxury to stay here and agree with the below comments that this is an equivalent of a European 3 star hotel.

AF13707,,Couples,A slightly disappointing experience,1/22/2025,"Our room at the hotel was very impressive but sadly quite noisy. You could hear everything from the corridors and in the room above. The hotel itself was a bit tired.  The green swimming pool was amazing and usually quite quiet but the main pool was very busy all the time and with lots of children playing games so it was not very peaceful. 

The setting is lovely and the beach is really very beautiful, we enjoyed spending time on it.

The staff were well meaning and friendly however we did have a few issues. I think perhaps not all of what we said/asked was understood but instead of asking to clarify they said yes and just said of course, no problem. This meant that we had a couple of situations which left us with problems. 

We booked a PCR test and expressly asked if the cost could be charged to our room.

the setting is lovely and the beach is really very beautiful, we enjoyed spending time on it.

the staff were well meaning and friendly however we did have a few issues. i think perhaps not all of what we said/asked was understood but instead of asking to clarify they said yes and just said of course, no problem. this meant that we had a couple of situations which left us with problems.

Reingleiv,,Family,Remnants of former luxury,11/21/2025,"We stayed at this hotel for the first time back in the late 90s, when it was called Triton. By the way, the statue of this Triton still flaunts at the entrance. It was a marvelous, respectable hotel with several restaurants, a tea room, fine service, and two lovely swimming pools. This is a beautiful colonial-style building, inside there are very beautiful galleries, between which water flows, trees and flowers grow. This is real architecture, not a soulless block with rooms. Unfortunately, the hotel ended up under water in December, 2004. The staff will tell you that only the first floor was flooded, and they will lie. Typical tsunami traces will also be on the third floor, this can be seen, although the walls are being tinted. I don't really understand how they got 5 stars. It is a very sad sight of destruction and extinction. The hotel is a pity as an old horse, from which they are trying to squeeze out the remnants of strength. Unmown grass, peeling sun loungers, frayed beach towels, yellowed bath towels, stained old linen, squeaky air conditioner, mildew, dampness, musty. Tiles are falling off in pools. Fence-mesh around the perimeter.

Kavin Jayanetti,"Houston, Texas",,Quarantining at Heritance Inbox,4/21/2025,"We had an overall good experience when we were quarantined for 13 nights at Heritance, Ahungalla.

The hotel: It was a pleasant hotel. There were many activities, functions for the guests, but we didn't participate because of personal choice.

The room: We stayed in a luxury suite, and it was very roomy. I had a large balcony so I could relax while distancing myself from others. I felt like we were staying at a single-bedroom apartment.

The staff: Every single person we met went above and beyond. Especially, Duminda and the team and housekeeping. There was not much Sri Lankan food for us, so the F&B team made special orders for the ex-Sri Lankans. That was the highlight of the stay. There was no office room available, so they let me do my work from the cafeteria. Also, Jaminja (Cpt) made me some excellent ginger tea and coffee.

Food: Main meals we sub-par for a five-star hotel, but the dessert menu was the best dessert menu I've ever seen. The person who was on the wok station made sure we get tasty meals as well-my personal favorite food station!

Tours: We took a 1-day tour to Anuradhapura. Our tour guide did his best to make sure we enjoy our trip, but overall the tour did not meet our expectations; we paid $350 (Rs. 69,500). For breakfast, we received one water bottle, a sandwich made with ham and butter, an orange, a banana, a piece of cake, and a sugary snack. And we received the same for lunch. The vehicle was not roomy; made for long tours- we are average-sized people, and there was not much legroom. We had another tour planned for the day after next to Pollonnaruwa, but I decided to cancel it. We don't mind paying money for the tours but expect a way better service.

W Gammanpila,,,"Terrible. Unbelievable. Worst Experience in any  Hotel in Sri Lanka, let alone a Five Star one & we have stayed in many",2/21/2025,"On arrival, when Reception was informed we'd been confirmed Room 333, we were  told that our room would not be ready for another 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, we were then told that it would not be ready for another few hours as it's a luxury room & will take that long to clean. When we asked if this was because the previous occupants checked out late, we were told they didn't know, and when pressed, they admitted that was the reason. When we said that shouldn't have happened as the room was booked, & previous occupants should not be allowed to check out late, they offered us a ""transit room, free of charge"" until the room we had booked (which was more expensive than this ""transit room"" was ready. How could they possibly think we would be happy with a ""transit room"", which was cheaper & more basic than the one we had booked & put up with the inconvenience involved in changing rooms? When we said we weren't happy with this & insisted on talking to the Manager, he finally  turned up some time later & said the previous occupants couldn't be vacated on time as they were elderly & disabled, but they would have four cleaners clean the room & it would be ready in 30 mins. Finally, we had access to the room we booked at 3.45pm (although, we should have had the room at 2pm), but we still had to wait another 15 minutes (i.e. until 4pm)  for our luggage, which had been sent to the cheaper ""transit room""& had to be brought back. So, they broke their contract. A room we should have had at 2pm, was only given to us at 4pm (2 hours later). We later discovered that the previous occupants were not elderly at all.

We went there for our annual gathering of my workplace and we have reserved about 19 rooms for the last weekend.

please find the following:

Welcome:
They have warmly welcomed us and given the rooms on time. It is appreciated since we got the rooms just within half an hour.

Rooms:
The room given to me and my wife was on the third floor. Right at the moment we stepped in to the room we felt that it was not cleaned properly. Basically it was not swept at all for weeks as we felt.

We were not even provided with the bathrobes to the rooms. Further, only two towels were available at the room and not even the face towels were placed.

Bathroom amenities were so old and an immediate renovation should be taken place.

One of the Tea/Coffee mugs in the room was not washed (Pictures attached).

Buffet:
Only one restaurant in operation or only one restaurant is available. It was totally crowded.

Dinner on 26th Sept 2020:
Restaurant was fully crowded. They do not provide at least the enough seating capacity for the guests. If I'm not mistaken, there were two other groups checked-in to the hotel during that day. However they have arranged some tables outside the restaurant where they were not attended by a single restaurant staff member just to refill their water goblets.
Food was totally bad and had a very bad experience with the so called Sri Lankan Chicken Kottu Roti. It was totally frozen andwas not tasty at all. I have complained but the only answer I got from the so called F&B Manager or the Guest Services Representative was 'Will inform and will check with the chef'. Is that an answer from a so called hotel chain like Heritance by Aitken Spence??? 
Restaurant staff were not capable of attending to the guests and could not even clean the buffet frequently. Please find the attached pictures of the Ice Cream corner. 

Breakfast on 27th Sept 2020:
Compared to the dinner on previous night, this was slightly okay. But they failed arrange the seating for the whole set of occupents.

Lunch on 27th Sept 2020:
Again it was horrible and had nothing to eat at all. We went for lunch around 1.30pm and even on that time they are out of some food. They had a bowl with a name tag 'Chicken Sausages' and only a half of a sausage is left. When I asked for 4 sausages to me & my wife, the guy came and noted our table and promised to bring them to our table. But unfortunately I couldn't see him afterwards. When it comes to desserts corner, there were nithing to eat at all and please refer the pictures attached. No more refilling or serving and the time was 2.35pm.

Premises:
There was a very bad smell in the whole hotel from the evening to the noon of the next day. When inquired, they said it is from the sea. But please note that this is not the only hotel we visted in the sea side and we have no any kind of an experience from the rest of the hotels we visited.

I have never being to a Heritance Hotel before and I hope that the rest of the Heritance hotels would not be like this.

Personally, I'm so disappointed with the hotel and I didn't expect this kind of a service and an experience from you guys. 

Lack of staff, does not mean that you are free from providing the five star hospitality. If you don't have the sufficient staff, please do not accept so much of bookings for a day.

In my opinion, you should pay more attention to the above in order to provide a better experience to the people who visit Heritance Ahungalla. Further, especially in this period, you all are surviving just because of the locals.

I'm truly disappointed and also feel very sad.

premises:
there was a very bad smell in the whole hotel from the evening to the noon of the next day. when inquired, they said it is from the sea. but please note that this is not the only hotel we visted in the sea side and we have no any kind of an experience from the rest of the hotels we visited.

i have never being to a heritance hotel before and i hope that the rest of the heritance hotels would not be like this.

personally, i'm so disappointed with the hotel and i didn't expect this kind of a service and an experience from you guys. 

lack of staff, does not mean that you are free from providing the five star hospitality. if you don't have the sufficient staff, please do not accept so much of bookings for a day.

in my opinion, you should pay more attention to the above in order to provide a better experience to the people who visit heritance ahungalla. further, especially in this period, you all are surviving just because of the locals.

i'm truly disappointed and also feel very sad.

by the way, good luck!",,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,2,161,147,172,139

We were happy to book into the Heritance . But did not have the good experience that we had expected. Our rooms were quite dirty . So much so that my daughter cleaned her room with a packet of Babywipes. My Husband did some cleaning with a towel . I refused to do so . I do not think that this should be part of my Holiday. Then we checked our pillows and duvet and had a big shock. We took our bedding to the lobby and were quickly ushered in to a back room . After complaining we were offered an , as the Manager called it , an upgraded room. We were taken to have a look at the room and were happy to move in to it . It was actually exactly the same room as the dirty one but newly decorated with a new shower etc. Before we moved in to the new room the manager asked would it be Ok if he would go and check the bedding . Of course we agreed . At around 11 o'clock I heard loud voices from my daughters room . I went to see what was going on and again the bedding was dirty . Duvet cover had a big brown stain on it and one of the pillows had mould all over it. The manager told us "" that is why we put 2 pillow cases on it ""  OH DEAR !!!!!!

Blessing,,,An unpleasant experience with a hint of theft from staff,12/19/2025,"The room itself was okay, relatively clean and fair in size. My biggest issue with the stay was that, when relaxing or walking on the beach, there were around 15ish street merchants constantly harassing me and other guests to buy their clothes (at extortionate prices compared to going to a local shop or market), as well as being badgered to book tours, again at 2-3 times the price when booking away from the beach. I have to point out that these were not hotel employees, but independent traders whom for some reason had access to the hotel every day we stayed there.

The hotel offers a baggage handling service where they will move your bags to and from your room for you free of charge, however, be vigilant as personal items were stolen from our luggage between us leaving the room to checkout, and our bags being moved by one of the staff members.

In all honesty, I have stayed at many hotels in different countries and I would say, this is the one time I have gone on holiday and not felt like I was actually on holiday as there was just that much badgering going on that it was almost impossible to relax. Upon walking out of the front gates of the hotel, you would have 4-5 tuk tuk drivers ask and try to take you to places you have repeatedly told them you do not wish to go and although this is not the hotel's fault, when it happens every single day, I feel as though it has to be mentioned.

Sammy F,"London, United Kingdom",Couples,Lovely hotel awful service,11/19/2025,"We travelled around Sri Lanka for 2 weeks staying in 6 different hotels, and this was by far the worst service we received out of our entire stay. 

The hotel itself is nice, rooms spacious and clean, pool area is nice. We dined in the a la carte restaurant which was nice. Don’t bother with half board / all inclusive - there’s a handful of restaurants on the beach with better food. 

The worst part is there seems to be some American expectation of tipping for absolutely everything, and if you don’t then you simply won’t get served!! 

Despite many signs around the pool saying sunbeds can’t be reserved, it seems the pool boy is more than happy to reserve these for a tip. I was up at 7:30am (jetlag), and there was just 1 set of sunbeds left despite no one actually being by the pool! We stayed there until midday, and some of the reserved beds only became occupied at 11am! So frustrating for everyone else. One woman took the reservation off and the pool boy flat out refused to give her a towel, even arguing with her! She went and got her own, and by midday no one had come to claim the bed! Awful! 

We went to the bar one night, they saw us walk in. They proceeded to offer every other group table service but us! I had to go to the bar 3 times for menus, drink etc., yet they still charged 10% service! 

On check-out you get shoved in some tiny room round back to pay your bill which is actually quite intimidating. No one asked if we had a nice stay or where we were going next, or even said bye when we left! 

While I do appreciate Sri Lanka is a poor country and tipping is needed, this was the only hotel during our whole trip that had this greedy mentality. We saved hard for this trip and don’t appreciate being treated like lesser people because we don’t have lots of extra money for tips! 

They also seem to have no problem in letting touts in to the hotel who come up to you on your sunbed to sell you a sari!

DilshanK,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",Couples,Great Location. Ancient old rooms & poor Service.,6/19/2025,"We visited to celebrate our anniversary. Even though its quite apparent that we are a couple, a  twin room was provided. In the reservation page its mentioned about a sea view room  (""best perhaps are the private balconies – from where it will seem as if the sunsets are ablaze in glory, just for you""). The photo also showing a sea view room.  But we were given a garden view room in an isolated corner. When inquired the answer was ""sorry sir we are full today"". Its not an excuse.  I must mention that we were not late for our check in . Actually we came around 12.30pm because we planned to have the lunch as well . 
Then moving to the condition of the room itself, It's very old looking small one. The doors were rusted, stained & discolored. The Bathroom is small, ancient & basic. Walls faded & definitely need painting & renovation. Even most of the 2-3 star level hotels provided a much superior rooms than this. 
Neither Toothpaste, toothbrush nor shaving items provided which are expected to be provided in a  5 star hotel. We had to asked for it. When asked  they have provided us with two packs of toothbrushes & only one of them had a tiny toothpaste for us two. Anyway we manged it economically for two days although both of us used to brush teeth after each & every meal. We didn't bring those because all the other five star hotels we have visited have provided them without any fuss & we honestly expected this hotel to be the same standard level.
 I noticed the lack of the shaving kit  only in the next day morning. I knew i had to ask for it again. But as we are checking out anyway i didn't bother the housekeeping staff early in the morning and left my self unsaved for the breakfast. I'm wondering whether they are providing older rooms especailly for the discounted booking offers.
We reserved Heritance Ahungalla thinking that they would provide with the same exceptional service like their Heritance Kandalama which we visited sometime back.

jccoffey,"Melbourne, Australia",Friends,Winding Down at Ahungalla,6/19/2025,"We have just finished a 3 night stay at this 5 star resort, as a wind down at the end of our 14 day JourneyScapes tour. The hotel is on the beach but unless you are a strong swimmer I suggest you stick to the pools! Beautiful at sunset but expect to be harassed by the lovely ladies selling sarongs!
This resort was designed by famous architect, Geoffrey Bawa, is is cleverly constructed with nature and building blending perfectly together, as is the case in Bawa’s beautiful Lunuganga estate nearby. Don’t miss the  old Triton builders’ lift he designed, now displayed in the foyer! The hotel is not new and could do with some renovation in the future, but it offers everything a 5 star resort should, from two large and immaculately clean pools and well tended grounds to excellent service from all staff. Our room attendant, Suranjith, was especially kind and helpful, always with a smile on his face. He even went out of his way to find out the brand of the lovely bath products in our room. 
Food in the main restaurant was buffet style, except for the last evening, when most guests had departed. This menu is extensive, well prepared and delicious! There is an emphasis on amazing Sri Lankan food, but there are sufficient choices to suit even the fussiest diner. We particularly liked the delicious a la carte meal on the last night. There is also a cafe and a Seafood Restaurant. The friendly, informative head chef, Chaluka, told us that where possible the food is sourced locally. So fresh!
We were at the hotel over a weekend and Saturday was very busy, with lots of people coming for the night. Could be very crowded in peak season. However the staff managed the large numbers very professionally. On Sunday we had the pool to ourselves once again!
Our room overlooked one of the pools and was well appointed, with comfortable beds and a large bathroom. Suitable towel rails are lacking however, with the main one over the toilet.

Pavlos T,"Enfield, United Kingdom",Couples,2 week holiday,4/19/2025,"We decided to visit Sri Lanka as 3 couples me and my wife, sister, brother, sister in-law and brother in-law. 
We booked our trip through Tui and decided to book the Heritance Ahungalla as our accommodation. The only problem was that my brother and sister in-law did not book until a week later and did not manage to book this hotel as it became fully booked so they booked into the sister hotel next door which was the Rio which was partly owned by Tui.
Firstly I want to make a comparison between these two hotels the Heritance is more a Sri Lankan style hotel and the Rio is very modern. The rooms in the Heritance are big and comfortable but could do with some updating. It has 2 swimming pools which are very warm. 
There is main restaurant were everbody eats is ok but can get busy and you may sit outside if you wish you can also eat at 2 additional restaurants at a price if you are all inclusive like us you can get a 50% discount. 
You have to be aware that even if you are all inclusive not all drinks are free, usually locally produced drinks are but not here. If you eat in the main restaurant and have drinks its all inclusive soft drinks, beer and wine. If you go out to the bar to watch the entertainment and ask for wine you have to pay not only that but even for a 
cappuccino, even locally produced alcohol. This is not all inclusive!
Be aware the staff at the hotel don't speak very good English not like in the Rio. We found that we had to keep asking the waiters and waitresses continually in the restaurant to get a drink as they kept forgetting, but outside in the bar they were pretty quick to serve you drinks.
I found this to be penny pinching not like in the Rio as the staff would serve you quickly and what ever you wanted at not extra charge as we found out due to my sister in-law paying for us to have all day access to the hotel for her Birthday. 
I would say that its up to the individual on what hotel is better suited for your needs.

Anthony M,"Brighton, United Kingdom",Couples,So it doesn't have a Corby Trouser Press but those who want one are missing the point,2/19/2025,"An awful lot of the people complaining about this hotel are moaning that it 'isn't five star'. As I recall, until fairly recently, a hotel in the UK had to have a Corby Trouser Press in the room to gain that vital fifth star. So maybe people are taking their view of '5 star' from the UK and, if they are then they are probably right - it isn't UK 5 star. But if it was you'd be paying a hell of a lot more than £150/night for it.
It is, by any measure a stunning hotel. Cleverly designed by Geoffrey Bawa this low rise hotel (ground floor and two floors above) is laid out to create a series of separate spaces that never seem crowded (they only have just over 100 rooms). The setting, right on the beach, is terrific and the two giant pools are a delight.
Those people giving it a poor review also complain that it is 'tired'. It would hardly be surprising given the fight against the elements that must be waged to maintain it but I can't agree. The grounds are imaculate and, yes some of the corridors are showing their age but the spacious rooms are absolutely fine.
I've also found the staff to be gracious, charming and attentive. Most Sri Lankans are but here they definitely go the extra kilometre.
And you can't fault the food, especially the buffet breakfast which will set you up for the entire day. The buffet supper is also excellent with a cornucopia of choice and a good selection of wines.

emac8612,"Prenton, United Kingdom",Couples,Nowhere near 5*,2/19/2025,"Nothing five star about this hotel. That doesn’t mean it’s terrible, it just doesn’t do what it says on the tin. We should’ve realised when we saw the deal we got. However, blissfully unaware we departed for what was meant to be a 5* hotel in Sri Lanka. From the start things went wrong. I didn’t understand how a hotel with 5* reviews on Tripadvisor could be so different to reality. But, what they do is they hand out cards asking you to rate them 5*, i presume most oblige as if you don’t they repeatedly ask you and get a “bit” irritated if you don’t. Unpleasant and unnecessary and not something you would ever experience in a 5* resort. 

Room: Our first room smelled like an ash tray, for two non smokers this was just an immediate no. After we said we wanted a new room they looked frustrated, but acknowledge the smell. Seemingly they wanted us to just ‘get on with it’. I don’t know if a 5* hotel which permits smoking indoors, especially with private terraces available. Finally we moved rooms (having to unpack / repack). Our second room had a broken AC, which in 32 degree heat was also unacceptable. After two nights of no sleep, 5 complaints about the AC and being told “it’s fine”, we finally moved to a third room. The AC worked and the room was much larger, an upgrade we thought. However, after the first night it was all clear. We were next to the maintenance and cleaning room, so at about 6.30-7am every morning we were woken up by the sound of trolly wheels on the stone floor. It is so loud that you don’t stand a chance of sleeping through. Initially they don’t turn down the bed and don’t give you the water they promise. 

The upside of the rooms are the large and comfy beds, and our room housekeeper (Rukhal) was good and left funny towel shapes (monkeys, dogs etc). 

Poolside: the pools are great, we spent most of our days by the green pool. Lots of space and a nice atmosphere. However, they don’t clear up so following morning you will find yesterdays banana skins, glasses etc. Quite disgusting. We ended up clearing up ourselves. 

Staff: some great members of staff, highlight was definitely Waruna. Seemingly the only trained and wanting to please member of staff. The rest don’t want to be there and expect to be greated with eye rolls and attitude even when ordering food. You feel like you’ve inconvenienced them at great length. Try ordering a cappuccino at breakfast and you’ll know what I mean. Especially when you get a cold one and ask for a hot one. Three people will try to tell you to drink it and then dip a finger in when you say it’s cold. Going the extra mile certainly doesn’t come naturally. 

Another upside was when the guest relations manager walked around asking for feedback. We shared our experience and things improved, that evening our bed was turned down, more water was given and pool was improved. It lasted merely one day though. 

Also, one member of staff in the restaurant wears an unsightly net vest! I think he is trying to be funny. Seems unhygienic and out of place. 

The hotel is filled with staff but they are untrained and only do one job e.g open door, fill water (no other beverage) so you end up waiting a long time. They also take your food away from you before you have finished and give you bill before you are ready. Stressful, to say the least. 

Food: the local food is great, especially the Dahl. Lots of food available and we can’t complain. Not 5* but still very good. 

Facilities: they claim to have several bars and restaurant but there aren’t, or at least not in use. They also have mould in several areas, cracks and paint chipping. The toilets don’t have soap and are often untidy. 

Spa: fab! Loved it and worth a visit. 

Entertainment: avoid! Hotel should stick to the live music. The shows and plays ruin what would be a romantic evening with your other half. 

Overall: despite all this, we had a great holiday, but that was down to my husband and I laughing about it all and making the most of it. I would even recommend this place to others, but with the caveat - you get what you pay for. It’s a firm 3*. WiFi is also fab! 

Tip: visit some of the local restaurants on the beach! Great food. Also, stay away from ocean - strong currents and big waves. Can be very dangerous and if red flag is up your insurance won’t cover any accidents. Don’t forget to check your bill, they say 50% off but don’t give it to you unless you remind them.

poolside: the pools are great, we spent most of our days by the green pool. lots of space and a nice atmosphere. however, they don’t clear up so following morning you will find yesterdays banana skins, glasses etc. quite disgusting. we ended up clearing up ourselves. 

staff: some great members of staff, highlight was definitely waruna. seemingly the only trained and wanting to please member of staff. the rest don’t want to be there and expect to be greated with eye rolls and attitude even when ordering food. you feel like you’ve inconvenienced them at great length. try ordering a cappuccino at breakfast and you’ll know what i mean. especially when you get a cold one and ask for a hot one. three people will try to tell you to drink it and then dip a finger in when you say it’s cold. going the extra mile certainly doesn’t come naturally. 

another upside was when the guest relations manager walked around asking for feedback. we shared our experience and things improved, that evening our bed was turned down, more water was given and pool was improved. it lasted merely one day though. 

also, one member of staff in the restaurant wears an unsightly net vest! i think he is trying to be funny. seems unhygienic and out of place. 

the hotel is filled with staff but they are untrained and only do one job e.g open door, fill water (no other beverage) so you end up waiting a long time. they also take your food away from you before you have finished and give you bill before you are ready. stressful, to say the least. 

food: the local food is great, especially the dahl. lots of food available and we can’t complain. not 5* but still very good. 

facilities: they claim to have several bars and restaurant but there aren’t, or at least not in use. they also have mould in several areas, cracks and paint chipping. the toilets don’t have soap and are often untidy. 

spa: fab! loved it and worth a visit. 

entertainment: avoid! hotel should stick to the live music. the shows and plays ruin what would be a romantic evening with your other half. 

overall: despite all this, we had a great holiday, but that was down to my husband and i laughing about it all and making the most of it. i would even recommend this place to others, but with the caveat - you get what you pay for. it’s a firm 3*. wifi is also fab! 

tip: visit some of the local restaurants on the beach! great food. also, stay away from ocean - strong currents and big waves. can be very dangerous and if red flag is up your insurance won’t cover any accidents. don’t forget to check your bill, they say 50% off but don’t give it to you unless you remind them. expect an eye roll and potentially an argument before it happens.",,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,2,148,135,158,125

JohnandKathyP,"London, United Kingdom",Couples,"Sadly, a disappointment",1/19/2025,"With a 4.5 Tripadvisor rating, and nearly 3,000 people rating it either excellent or very good, it’s hard to be the minority guest who complains, and this is perhaps the problem – a little like The Emperor’s New Clothes;  if enough people say it’s great, then surely it must be great ?

Well no, not necessarily . . . while the hotel is very good in many respects, it has a few underlying failings that are not expected in a hotel of this grade, with the whole experience only held together by a brigade of (on the whole) excellent staff to detract from what was largely a disappointing stay in a number of respects.

CHECK IN
Absolutely 5 star; we did not even go to the desk; our luggage disappeared in one direction while we were led to the poolside bar and given cold fruit juice while our check-in was processed.
We were then escorted to our room and shown the mini-bar, air-con, etc.
Very difficult to fault, and a first class welcome.

ACCURACY OF BOOKING
The first let-down; we requested a top floor quiet room, not overlooking the pool.
We got a 1st floor room, not only overlooking the pool with a sideways sea view, but directly over the pool bar.
Due to the horse-shoe design around the pool, we assumed all rooms faced the pool; it was only a few days into our holiday we discovered an additional wing either side of this with garden / sea views.
By this time we were well and truly unpacked, but how difficult would it have been to read our request and put us in the appropriate room on arrival?

ROOM FACILITIES
A little tired and showing signs of age, but on the whole everything you need.
Excellent a/c that is on 24/7, unlike many hotels where it goes off when you remove your key card.
Sliding door-type window blinds that gave a complete night time black-out.
Safe in wardrobe, but on top of a small chest, so hanging anything above meant clothes draped over the safe – obscuring the safe and creasing clothes.
Extremely comfy beds with daily linen change; ditto daily towel change.
Uncomfortable sofa in room and ditto 2 x chairs on balcony; not designed for long chilled evenings – perhaps they would prefer you to be in the bar instead of drinking on your balcony?

BATHROOM
Excellent shower with toiletries topped up daily.
Extraction not 100%, with lots of steam and condensation after showering.
A down-side also is the hair dryer; hard-wired to a spur in the bathroom meaning 2nd person could not shower until 1st person had dried hair, or 1st person sat in the room with wet hair while 2nd person showered.
Also no nozzle on hairdryer making styling impossible.
A strange design of windows in the bathroom stud walls with Venetian blinds; lots of gaps all around, meaning you will need to be on very good terms with whoever you are sharing with.

DINING
The biggest disappointment of all; we had read all the reviews prior to booking, and were geared up for a feast of real Sri-Lankan buffet nightly;
The reality was the same thin, on-the-bone chicken curry trotted out daily, with some variation of veg sides; biggest disappointment was that for the whole 10 days, including 2 Gala Dinners, we did not eat anything that was truly hot.
All dishes, from breakfast through to the last dinner, were tepid or luke-warm, with some cold.
The selection of dishes might be huge, but the quality is well, well below this grade of hotel.
A big issue was the amount of large tables for 12 or more that dominated the dining room to accommodate the several large parties who were there; we struggled daily to find a table for 2 that was not sandwiched between one of these.
The sound of grizzling children and loud parents all shouting over each other became the backdrop for all of our eating; the last time I ate in this type of environment was at Pontins Blackpool in 1990.
A mass dining hall, not a 4/5 star hotel restaurant.

YOUR FELLOW GUESTS
We were told by several different staff members that rooms are routinely sold off at highly discounted rates to Sri Lankan and Indian families; not what you want to hear when you have just spent 5K on your holiday . . . 
This ensured a strange mix of European honeymoon couples, families who had booked through a tour operator, and a disproportionally huge amount of large families of 12-16 who had grabbed a bargain.
This was echoed in the dress code – or lack of – in the restaurant, with people rolling up in beachwear and skimpy shorts, while reception was awash with people dashing from the pool to the lift in swimwear, dripping wet and soaking the tiled floors.
More 3 star Spain in the 1980’s than a 4/5 star experience.

THE STAFF
Perhaps the nicest, calmest, and politest staff we have ever come across anywhere in the world, which I fear is what stops most people from complaining or ‘making a fuss’.
One or two exceptions; the cashier who, on our changing up money, threw back 2 x £20 notes with a sneer saying ‘dirty money Madame’ because they had pen marks on, (from the bank not us I may add);
The boy on reception who, on being asked for help with train times, told my wife to ‘look it up on line’ then took her phone, switched off flight mode, and connected her to International Roaming; cue a dozen updates and text messages from U.K.
Thanks for that; we await our O2 bill with some trepidation.

ENTERTAINMENT
As above, more 1970’s than post-milenium, with the same dated song-book standards being peddled out nightly by a band who are in desperate need of a lead singer.

NEW YEAR GALA DINNER
This deserves a review in it’s own right – a band who had been warming up since 5.00 in the afternoon playing 80’s American rock at an ear-splitting volume; a D.J. who begins his set with Bohemian Rhapsody and Another Brick in the Wall; and best of all – a beauty contest by the pool that started around 10.30 p.m. and resumed again after the New Year count-down.
Once again, ‘entertainment’ more worthy of Pontins or Haven than a luxury resort, and more to the point, a spectacle that the U.K. consigned to the history books some 40 years ago.
As for the food; more of the same; a huge spread, and the work the kitchen put into creating a wonderful display was a marketing exersize worthy of Satchi and Satchi, with hundreds of photos appearing on Facebook and Instagram world-wide; sadly, nothing hot enough to enjoy.

ACCURACY OF YOUR TAB ON CHECK-OUT
This has to be the prize for staff member(s) most in need of re-training;
On paying our bill at 7.00 a.m. on check-out day, we were amazed to see over £200 had been added as a ‘half board surcharge’ when we had booked and paid for half board with mercury holidays.
Perhaps they hoped we would not notice?
Well, we did, and the resulting argument was not a great start to the day. ‘Sorry Sir, he is training’ . . . , sorry, but training or not, somebody input the charge into the computer when it should have been absolutely clear what board basis we were booked in on.
Another sting, (which we were aware of before arrival so we factored in) is the 10% service and 15% Govt. tax that is added to all advertised prices, making a hefty difference to your bottom line.

IN SUMMARY
A rather pretentious and tired hotel that could very easily be a great hotel if a few easy-fixes were put in place; 
This is unlikely however when the staff ask ‘is everything ok’ and we all say ‘oh yes; it’s lovely . . . ‘
They will continue doing more of the same until guest stop being in awe of the overall experience, wake up and smell the coffee, and politely tell them where they are going wrong.",,it,negative,en,positive,unknown,unknown,"sadly, a disappointment","with a 4.5 tripadvisor rating, and nearly 3,000 people rating it either excellent or very good, it’s hard to be the minority guest who complains, and this is perhaps the problem – a little like the emperor’s new clothes;  if enough people say it’s great, then surely it must be great ?

Victoria F,,Couples,Hoped for a 5* haven for a few days after travelling around Sri Lanka,8/18/2025,"We have just returned from a fabulous 2 week honeymoon in Sri Lanka.  We had stayed in 3 fab places before our final stop at The Heritance.  From looking at the website and booking the holiday through a luxury travel agent, it looked like it was going to be a lovely retreat to relax in for 5 days.  Unfortunately this wasn’t quite the case...

I had e-mailed and Facebook messaged the hotel the day before arrival.  I asked whether they had any suites or some of their best rooms available to upgrade to, as we were on our honeymoon and wished for something extra special.  The responded via Facebook asking for my e-mail address so that they could forward information on.  I responded and I didn’t get anything back.  I then e-mailed them directly-nothing back again!! Nothing was said on check in...no special greeting...nothing.

We were taken to our room, I told the lady taking us there that I had e-mailed and wanted to make sure we got a sea view.  She was quite dismissive.  When we got to our room, it was ground floor level taking us straight out to the pool.  You could hear the sea, but defiantly couldn’t see it.  The room was pleasant enough-modern with a big bed but definatly not 5 star.  There was a congratulations cake on the table to great us (we had one at most places we stayed to be honest).  But that was the only thing we got to feel special.  No one asked whether we would like to organise a special dinner etc etc.  

As the cake was so big, it was going to take us several days to eat it.  Housekeeping could have taken it away and put it in the fridge, but instead it was left out on the side to attract ants.  

We were just overall a bit disappointed...it was defiantly more of a family hotel and there were kids everywhere the whole weekend we were there and breakfast was crazy-we thought that the hotel was opening up the restaurant and pool to non residents at the weekend.  The restaurant needs a facelift for sure as it again did not feel like 5* dining.  At breakfast we always waited patiently to be seated, once seated the waitress or waiter would hurry off without asking whether we would like tea or coffee.  I then had to try and grab someone’s attention again so it basically took 15 minutes to get a hot drink.  A little poor for 5*.  

We had lunch via room service a couple of days and that was pleasant enough-very little choice but if you like chips and sandwiches then it’s fine.  They had no samosas and very few of the wines on the extensive wine list on show.  I had to chose 3 different wines before finally getting the 4th one I asked for.  Also if you like cocktails, you will be disappointed as the ones I had at the hotel were not very nice.  

We only ate dinner in the restaurant once during our 5 night stop, as we decided we would get better service and food elsewhere.  The fine dining restaurant had no people in on any of the nights we were there and we just couldn’t think of anything worse than the madness of that buffet restaurant again.  Where the staff were in attentive and miserable.

Sorry Heritance but we just expected more I’m sorry.  And to top it all off we got a phone call the morning of check-out just to make sure we were checking out on time or if we had booked a late check out.  And a bill pushed through the door the night before.  Come on...it was low season, hotel was not busy at all and we were on our honeymoon.  

Every morning we were woken at 5am by noisy people checking out of their rooms or walking in high heels right above our bedroom.  With being on the ground floor, we were right on the main drag for people moving around.  If we had been higher up with a lovely sea view, then we would have hopefully had some peace and quiet.",,en,neutral,en,negative,unknown,unknown,hoped for a 5* haven for a few days after travelling around sri lanka,"we have just returned from a fabulous 2 week honeymoon in sri lanka.  we had stayed in 3 fab places before our final stop at the heritance.  from looking at the website and booking the holiday through a luxury travel agent, it looked like it was going to be a lovely retreat to relax in for 5 days.  unfortunately this wasn’t quite the case...

Duneesha,,Family,Does not live up to the brand,4/18/2025,"I returned to Heritance Ahungalla after several years to relive my memories from the last trip which was excellent. This time however the hotel fell way short in meeting my expectations. It all started with a 45 minute waiting time just to get checked in. The lobby was storming with guests and baggage scattered everywhere reminded me of a government hospital than a star class hotel.
The room was very clean and neat however, I had booked myself in to a ""Deluxe King"" room with a ""King Size"" bed on the ground floor (printed on the confirmation). However I had been given a room on the 1st floor with two single beds put together. We were so eager to get to the beach that the minute we came to the room we unpacked and stormed off to the beach. It was when we returned we figured out that it was not a king size bed. Called and complained to the concierge and I was told that ""Sir, you have to make a special request for a king size bed at the time of booking if you needed one"". After 15 minutes of arguing and speaking to the duty manager was I offered to be shifted to another room. Again, a very clean and comfortable room but a small shower in a very odd triangular shape. Not for someone who is claustrophobic. 
We went for dinner in the main restaurant and it was chock-a-block. They had stuffed every available chair and table in to it and we could only move about sideways. The seemed to have a shortage of plates as we had to wait up to 5 minutes sometimes for fresh clean plates. And no service what so ever. There were only five or six waiting staff to serve and we hardly caught a glimpse of them. We were never even offered water. And I am still waiting for the tea I ordered to the table on the second morning of my visit.
Dinner was really good. There was a very decent variety of food and the taste was very good. But breakfast was not so exciting. There was no variance and every day it was pretty much the same assortment. In-room dinning was an absolute disaster. It felt as if ""In-room dinning"" is a whole new concept that the hotel staff is yet to hear about. There was no menu available in the room and two cheaply printed A4 sheets stapled together arrived at the door 30 minutes when we called and asked for one. We ordered two fried rice and let me tell you that I have had better fried rice served on a plane. It was a mixture of rice and boiled chicken with the odd piece of carrot.

Amy,Virginia,Family,"Don't be fooled by the photos, it's a disappointment!",4/18/2025,"Overall, the facilities were nice but we found this property to be poorly managed.

1) Check-in process wasn't organized well. 2 days after check-in, I was contacted and told I had an extra person and I had to pay more money. They didn't even bother understanding their error! We had provided all passports at check-in and we had booked 3 rooms. They had mixed up the adults/kids in the rooms and thought we tried to sneak in an adult at a kid rate. How is that possible if we provided our passports at check-in??? Then at check-out I was still charged and had to get it resolved again.

2) Food was average. And the setup is not optimal. Buffet is split into 2 rooms, with one room having large, open doors which basically let's in bugs/flies. This comes across as unhygienic and dirty. 

3) When sitting out by the pool, had to ask 3 times to get towels and ended up getting them ourselves. 

4) The room setup isn't good. The bathroom has blinds so it makes it really awkward for someone to use the bathroom. Also, the thermostat directions are on the balcony door (why not next to the thermostat).

5) We arrived on a Wednesday and were excited there would be a show. The show was terrible with what appeared to be some sort of mime type of performance.

Karen F,"Ferndown, United Kingdom",Family,A relaxing fortnight in a lovely setting,4/18/2025,"I will start with the positives as they far out way the negatives. This was my 8th visit to Sri Lanka and because the bentota beach was closed for refurb we stayed here for the first time and will return.
Positives
Arrival - greeted with fresh juices and friendly smiles, check in was smooth and stress free. The reception area was well presented, spacious and had stunning views of the pool.

Food - main restaurant food was varied and very tasty, catered for all tastes and the head chef happily cooked us a ""special dish"". Staff in the restaurant were friendly and everything was so clean. Towards the end of our holiday a large Arab family arrived and they were picking up food with their bare hands and putting it back, being hygienic I complained to a floor manager and very quickly the baskets of touched food was quickly removed - I was impressed. The pool snack bars served the most amazing ""fishfingers"" etc so we ate their for lunch
Drinks - the local alcohol was quite pleasant and plentiful in choice, international brand mixers were also included. 
Pools - the infinity pool was not to our taste as most of the sun beds were under low lying trees so offered little sunlight. We opted for the residents pool which offered lots of sunbed space, lovely pool staff, its own bar (with friendly bar men) and 2 jacuzzis. The staff kept the pool and surrounding area so clean.
LOcation - right on the beach, although too rough to swim the sea was fab for a dip and a mess about in the waves (sadly an English man drowned whilst we were there - he did however ignore the no swim warnings) and the staff at the hotel were fantastic with his poor wife and handled the situation with dignity and respect. There are a couple of shops just outside the hotel and bentota is a 20 minute drive away if u want to see a real local town. 

Staff - we have friends in Sri Lanka and our good friend Sunil introduced us to the hotel manager and several other people who ensured our stay was (almost)  perfect. It was the first time we saw so many female staff in a Sri Lankan hotel and it was refreshing and showed they are more forward thinking than other hotels we have stayed in over there. himaesha was a lovely lady and a real asset to the hotel. We also found fernando (who stemmed to work everywhere) a pleasure to spend time with-always smiling and upbeat. All in all the staff are top notch throughout the hotel.

NEgatives
I travelled in a small group (5 of us) one of which was disabled and myself on my own so I requested rooms together, we did not get them and could not of been any further apart - being spread out on 3 separate corridors.

Rooms - balcony size varies two of the rooms had huge balconies with amazing views and mine you could not swing a cat on it! My room also had a view of a large tree! The rooms are very dark and lighting needs to be looked at as they do not make much difference in the rooms, if you get rooms 242 or close by request a change I tried and was told the hotel was fully booked....

Beach sellers - that is where they belong but for some reason the guards were allowing them within the grounds (not as far as the pool side) weaving between the beds on the grass which if I had been sat in the area would have seriously hacked me off.

So that's it, we loved it, want to return and would recommend the heritance ahungalla","Avoid rooms around 242, rooms 228 and 236 had lovely views and big balconies",en,positive,en,positive,en,negative,a relaxing fortnight in a lovely setting,"i will start with the positives as they far out way the negatives. this was my 8th visit to sri lanka and because the bentota beach was closed for refurb we stayed here for the first time and will return.

Fuchs,,Couples,Would love to go back!,2/18/2025,"So first impressions...
Hotel design and overall impression is just lovely. It is airy, with open atrium spaces dotted throughout the hotel, filled with established trees, beautiful.
Room - needs some TLC and more clothes hangers!! NB there never is in any hotel!!! Extra ones delivered within the hour. but overall was clean and spacious. Twin bed quickly made into KS (within 30 mins!) and handle not attached to drawer... fixed next day. Could do with some more easy accessible plug points in the room.
All staff very friendly and keen to help and someone always cleaning somewhere!
Food - OMG!! Curry heaven!! Mix of western and traditional, some curries not for the faint hearted... Head Chef walks around the restaurant speaking to the guests and offering to cook requested dishes (within reasonable limits) which is a nice touch. 
Things to know:
Lunch at the coffee bar a good option, fish fingers and chips delicious and not what you expect....  sometimes service here a bit slow, but you are on holiday!!
Go for the quiet pool, though more people getting to know about it, on sunny days monkeys come to the fruit trees here about 5, but not every day. Lots of wildlife, lizards, geckos, palm squirrels (look like chipmunks), birds and the random cats and dogs
Do have a look at the non-inclusive cocktail menu : )
Be careful of what is not all inclusive...Diet Coke not, zero coke is!! Nor are the bits in the mini bar 
Evening entertainment mixed, but the Sri Lanka day on a Friday is lovely.
Unusually, the hotel shop is not very well stocked, so do not rely on it for emergency toiletries!! Luckily I don’t. Sells mainly gifts.
Dakshika and Trilishiya on the reception desk always greet you with a lovely smile and will try and help any way they can, they are both a real credit to the hotel.
Danuka in the bar area is really helpful and attentive (swear he has a twin brother as he is always there!!) and very kind.
Jananjaya is great with keeping us topped up with tea and coffee at breakfast!!
A thank you in Sinhalese is always appreciated.

Hawkers on the beach and edge of hotel do stop you but will take no for an answer, always haggle by at least half. 
Chaminder at the beach great for arranging transport, did a tuk tuk to Bentota and driver stayed with us the whole time and translated and helped haggle. 
Later in the holiday we hired a mini bus with driver through Chamindra to take four of us to Galle, firstly £50 all in versus £50 each they TUI! Stopped at a moonstone mine on the way, did a spot of shopping en-route. At Galle, walked and drove round the fort and town, stopped for lunch on the way back in Hikkadula, then had  walk round Natural Silk factory and shop on the way back, some lovely bits there!  Bought some tea from a local tea shop in Ahungalla for a very good price and lastly to the Spice Garden in Ahungalla, again interesting but beware the hard sell and the ‘free’ massages which are far from it...donations are expected. Got picked up at 10 and back by 5

Trips:
Elephant day at Uduwalawe amazing! Long coach trip there and back about 4 hours each way. Loo and later lunch stop at Centauria Wild, lunch ok, but the hotel also gives you a lunch  box as well as breakfast one! Give one away to the driver , Well worth the money and the early start!! (4.30 pick up back about 6.30)
Whale watching - accept there is no guarantee of what you see, we luckily saw dolphins, pilot whales and blue whale, amazing!! However, if it is a rainy day, take a change of clothes and a waterproof bag for your camera and phone!! We got soaked by rain and salt spray from the boat, plastic bucket seats really uncomfortable and not for the larger derriere ... the real shame is the amount of boats out at the same time, convinced it scared things off! The boats are not well designed in that the seats are very close together so it is really hard to get across and see things on the other side of the boat and some people do not move to let others see. The whole itinerary is great value for money if the weather is kind, but if you can stretch to booking a private car and boat, do it! Now I know what I know, that’s what’s I would do next time. This is a 4.30 pick up, back for just after 7
Madu river cruise - AMAZING! Do it!! Great value for money, short coach journey (less than 20 mins) we were lucky enough for the time of year to plant a mangrove sapling and release a baby turtle into the ocean, but think both these things depends on the time of year, so ask the rep. It is an afternoon trip so you get to spend the morning by the pool, back by 6.30
Kandy day, very very very long day... picked up at 4am from hotel got back at 9pm..... did the part coach, then train, then coach back, train was fun, a throwback to the 60’s... some other groups got back at 11pm...
Temple of the Tooth, whilst very interesting, we went the day before a National holiday and it was rammed! Beautiful building and setting, but too busy to take everything in. Lunch was the usual buffet affair, then onto the botanical gardens, lovely if you like plants and gardens, sadly wasted on me! Onto the tea factory which was really interesting, you can buy it cheaper from a local supermarket, but from the factory you know exactly where it came from. Final stop was a herbal and spice garden, which again is very interesting if you have not done it before. Least favourite of the four visits as too long a day and too much crammed in. Remember...4.00 am pick up and back for 9pm.... if you are lucky!

The cons: 
1. The receptionist offered us the opportunity to upgrade to full-board or half-board at a discount (USD30 instead of USD25 per meal). When we asked which restaurants this was applicable for, they said that it was only for the main restaurant, but failed to mention that it was ONLY valid for the buffet. If we had known, we wouldn't have signed up for two days of buffet-only meals. We found out because the waiter told us we couldn't have ala carte, and all of this happened after we'd paid for half-board for two days. In addition to not being told exactly what we were paying for, we discovered that the buffer cost LKR3,700 (USD24.2). So you're telling me that I didn't receive a discount--I'm actually paying the full cost of the buffet AND I'm locked in for a two-day commitment. This was dishonest on the hotel's part, and according to our travel agent, they shouldn't be directly giving us discounts--they're supposed to go through the agent. All in all, very poor form on the hotel's part. 

2. On the morning of our check-out date, my bathroom didn't have water. I couldn't use the sink, I couldn't shower; it's a good thing I didn't have to flush anything. I checked my dad's room next door - also no water. It took two calls for housekeeping for the water to come back. How is this acceptable? 

3. Our room had an odd smell that came from the bathroom drain. When we told the GRO, she said housekeeping would be around shortly to attend to it. They arrived 18 hours later. 

4. When we first arrived, there was no porter to be found and we waited a solid few minutes before the receptionist noticed that we wanted to check in with our bags. He then rushed out and seemed very frazzled. Out of the 7 hotels we stayed in Sri Lanka, this was by far the poorest reception we'd received. 

The pros: 
1. The restaurant staff were lovely, warm and attentive. My mum had a broken arm on this trip and the chef himself came out and helped her take food for the buffet and then walked her to her table.

Beninu A,"Hoejbjerg, Denmark",Couples,A tad more touristy than 15 years ago - but still a friendly service and nice atmosphere,11/17/2025,"I visited Heritance Ahungalla first time 16 years ago and again 15 years ago (when it was still operated under the name Triton), so I was very excited to go back to the hotel to see if it still carried that adventurous atmosphere that it did 16 years ago. I was also vevry excited to see how they had renovated the hotel after the horrible tsunami that destroyed much of the hotel about 10 years ago.

I remembered the hotel as a luxurious hotel with a very high standard both in the restaurant and in the small bars around the area where you could buy from a large snack menu. Many of these places were closed now to my disappointment. The hotel of course more or less looked the same and the beautiful architecture of Geoffrey Bawa - Sri Lankas world renowned architect - was of course still stunning.

I should say that my previous visits was during the peak season in february where the weather on that part of the island is fantastic. This time I visited in october and we experienced several hours of heavy rain on several of the days we stayed there, and of course that adds to the experience and the atmosphere as they had to keep huge plastic curtains down at all times to keep the water from running into the reception area and the bar area. The hallways was flooded due to the heavy rain and the open design of the hotel so they had to keep staff constantly mopping up water and that was of course no fault of theirs. That's just how it is during this season.

But something seemed changed. The hotel seemed to have lost that exclusivity that set it apart from other hotels in Ahugalla/Bentota region.15 years ago there were a wonderful atmosphere in the evenings with jazz band and dancing in the lounge next to the reception and pool area. This time around that was gone - much to our dismay.

We also remembered that every afternoon there was a very nice complimentary afternoon tea with buttercake and scones that you could enjoy just next to the large pool but when we asked if they still had it noone even seemed to remember that they had it 15 years ago.

We stayed in one of the huge suites with several rooms a seperate living room two bathrooms, a huge balcony overloooking the residents pool with a view of the ocean behind the row of palm trees along the coast line.

I don't know if some of the changes to the design and decor was due to the tsunami 10 years ago (after I visited the last time), but I remembered the beautiful residents pool (the other pool that are closed to anyone but guests in the suites and rooms in the fine wing with ocean view, and it was originally made with the most beautiful dark blue tiles that made it one of the most beautiful pools I had ever seen. This time the tiles have been removed and the pool was just an ordinary pool with a normal lightblue surface on the sides and bottom and not made from tiles anymore, just like so many ordinary pools you see all over Sri Lanka. That was sad - I thought. I may have needed refurbishment or renovation but they should have stayed true to the original design with the beautiful dark blue tiles when repairing the pool instead of the cheaper solution, as this did something to make the place stand out in a way that it now doesn't anymore. They also had a wonderful original boat like the ones used by the original population in Sri Lanka that was a trademark of Triton (as it was once called) but they had done little to keep it maintained, so it had obviously deteriorated over the last decade so they hadn't saved it (unless of course it was taken by the tsunami ten years ago). To me it was just a little sad to se that on the patio where it was once standing proud in the middle of the large pool was now just an empty plate with nothing to decorate the otherwise elegant pool area around the public pool and bar area.

Another thing that added to the impression they had lowered the standard since we last visited 15 years ago was the many families with screaming children running around the pool. 15 years ago there was a much more tranquil and serene atmosphere with adult guiests with a certain sense of etiquette, which includes preventing your children from running around the other quests at the pool and adressing strangers asking all sorts of questions instead of staying near their parents as they are supposed to when using the residents pool.

What had since we last visited become a sad but necessary precaution was a several meters high fence between the hotel grounds and the beach where only a small opening heavily guarded by two guards at all times (day and night) was the only passage to the beach. In the old days one could just stroll down through the line of shady palm trees and reach the beach from anywhere along the hotel grounds. But it was obviously a necessary precaution as we could see that many more touts and beggars and people selling all sorts of ridiculous junk and overpriced sarons, were all over the beach. It even seemed to us as if some of these local hustlers had some corrupt arrangement with some of the guards as they sometimes happened to be inside the fence (which means they have passed the guards unattended), and even when guards saw them on hotel grounds contacting the guests, they did absolutely nothing or very little to stop them from intimidating the guests and/or even excort them from the grounds, which would of course be their duty. One of the nights I stood in the dark on my balcony outside our suite and I noticed a visibly drunk guard who could hardly wallk in a straight line talking a little with himself while he suddenly stopped near the tennis court and fumbled with his trouser until he mannaged to unzip his pants in the middle of the lawn and urinate. That latter I could even live with - I'm no prude - had he just walked behind a tree and taken care of business, but I didn't find the fact that he was visibly drunk very reassuring.

The folloing nights I stayed for an hour on my balcony to see if the guard from the night before would return, would return, but much to my surprise I saw something very strange occur. One of the guards (not the same as the drunk guard from yesterday) suddenly turned on his torch and he waved it up and down and from side to sight while pointing it in the direction towards the edge of the hotel grounds. Shortly thereafter I saw two locals walking past the tennis courts and sitting just below my balcony between the building/wing and the tennis court. They couldn't see me as I kept the balcony lights off as well as the lights in the livingroom so I was hidden in the dark. I looked in astonishment as these very suspicious looking local people arrived and they opened small packages and presented them on the top of low walll surrounding the terrace belonging to the suite just below ours and the guards looked at the ""goods"" in the beam of their flashlight at what looked like small packages of either pot or very small portions of khat to me (I've only seen khat but nevver tried it so it could be something else, but I know that khat is very poular if you have a job where it's hard to stay awake and it's popular amongst lorry drivers etc. so I could imagine that a boring night shift would also tempt someone to use khat to keep from falling asleep as it is a mild energy booster that make that kan keep you awake and alert) and khat is actually not amongst forbidden substances in all countries (at least not in Europe), so the use of khat may even be legal in Sri Lanka, that I don't know. Well, that aside, the guards clearly counted and exchanged money for these ""goods"" in the dim light from their torch. Suddenly one of the guards heard me making a noise as I was taking a step back and he pointed the torch directly at my face and for a short while I was blinded, and they saw me on the balcony, so he turned off the torch and they exchanged a few hasty words with the locals who then wrapped up the rest of their goods and ran away along the tennis court and disappeared in the dark. This was in no way frightening or intimidating, but it just seemed like something that wouldn't have happened at the classy and stylish Triton of the old days, and it only contributed to the vague feeling that the standard of the hotel was not quite the same as it was 15 years ago.

From the experiences above one would have thought that it was a horrible experience, so why do I give it four stars after all? Because they still provide many of the things they provided in the old days. We always live in large suites when we travel, so I have a large backlog of experiences to use as comparison, and I must say that the suite was wonderful. It was clean and beautifully furnished and the large balcony streched all the way around the suite and had access doors from all rooms in the suite.

I will also like to give the place the benefit of the doubt, because many things were closed - and that might be because it is the low season in october, so my final judgment should not be made until I've tried the place again in the high season between medio january until medio march where the weather in the southwest part of the coast line of Sri Lanka has the most beautiful weather.

We also dined at the a la carte restaurant (not the large dining hall, but Restaurant Mustard at the terrace on the left side of the reception area just after the reception desk around the corner). The food was delicious, the service was perfect, and the setting was cozy with a dimly lit area and a very romantic atmosphere. So taht was truly perfect.

The in-room dining (room service) was also very good and arrived quickly. The breakfast was wonderful and came on time every morning exactly at the time we've put on the breakfast list to hang on the door before going to sleep.

The staff couldn't do a better job. They were quick, courteous, smiling, polite and they didn't hover at any time or made certain trick to earn extra tips (such as coming two persons to a one man job, or staying in the room and keep asking if everything is to our satisfaction, etc. - you know the drill). But none from the staff we met did that at any time. Of course my wife and I both agree on giving a generous tip at no less than 20% of the bill every time something is served, so we allso made it easy for the staff not to hover, and that should perhaps be taken into consideration, but we also find that people in Sri Lanka live on extremely low wages, and compared to the prices in Denmark where we live, even an additional 20% still makes for a very cheap price for people living in Europe, Australia and North America, so i cost us so little but means so much to them, so there is no need to be a miserly cheapskate. If you can afford an expensive plane ticket and to stay in a somewhat pricey hotel like this you probably can also survive giving 500-1000 Rps ($3-$6 USD) more when tipping the  waiter, room boy, luggage carriers, drivers, etc. It takes so little and being generous when tipping often comes back a thousand fold throughout your stay when you are being served by the grateful, hard working, staff at the hotel, trying to accomodate even your most extravagant wishes and habits.(That's just my personal opinion on this subject, and each to their own, of course).

I believe all rooms are non-smoking but most rooms are with a balcony (or a terrace if at ground level) so this is a comfortable hotel for smokers.",The large suites are beautiful and comfortable.

the folloing nights i stayed for an hour on my balcony to see if the guard from the night before would return, would return, but much to my surprise i saw something very strange occur. one of the guards (not the same as the drunk guard from yesterday) suddenly turned on his torch and he waved it up and down and from side to sight while pointing it in the direction towards the edge of the hotel grounds. shortly thereafter i saw two locals walking past the tennis courts and sitting just below my balcony between the building/wing and the tennis court. they couldn't see me as i kept the balcony lights off as well as the lights in the livingroom so i was hidden in the dark. i looked in astonishment as these very suspicious looking local people arrived and they opened small packages and presented them on the top of low walll surrounding the terrace belonging to the suite just below ours and the guards looked at the ""goods"" in the beam of their flashlight at what looked like small packages of either pot or very small portions of khat to me (i've only seen khat but nevver tried it so it could be something else, but i know that khat is very poular if you have a job where it's hard to stay awake and it's popular amongst lorry drivers etc. so i could imagine that a boring night shift would also tempt someone to use khat to keep from falling asleep as it is a mild energy booster that make that kan keep you awake and alert) and khat is actually not amongst forbidden substances in all countries (at least not in europe), so the use of khat may even be legal in sri lanka, that i don't know. well, that aside, the guards clearly counted and exchanged money for these ""goods"" in the dim light from their torch. suddenly one of the guards heard me making a noise as i was taking a step back and he pointed the torch directly at my face and for a short while i was blinded, and they saw me on the balcony, so he turned off the torch and they exchanged a few hasty words with the locals who then wrapped up the rest of their goods and ran away along the tennis court and disappeared in the dark. this was in no way frightening or intimidating, but it just seemed like something that wouldn't have happened at the classy and stylish triton of the old days, and it only contributed to the vague feeling that the standard of the hotel was not quite the same as it was 15 years ago.

from the experiences above one would have thought that it was a horrible experience, so why do i give it four stars after all? because they still provide many of the things they provided in the old days. we always live in large suites when we travel, so i have a large backlog of experiences to use as comparison, and i must say that the suite was wonderful. it was clean and beautifully furnished and the large balcony streched all the way around the suite and had access doors from all rooms in the suite.

i will also like to give the place the benefit of the doubt, because many things were closed - and that might be because it is the low season in october, so my final judgment should not be made until i've tried the place again in the high season between medio january until medio march where the weather in the southwest part of the coast line of sri lanka has the most beautiful weather.

we also dined at the a la carte restaurant (not the large dining hall, but restaurant mustard at the terrace on the left side of the reception area just after the reception desk around the corner). the food was delicious, the service was perfect, and the setting was cozy with a dimly lit area and a very romantic atmosphere. so taht was truly perfect.

the in-room dining (room service) was also very good and arrived quickly. the breakfast was wonderful and came on time every morning exactly at the time we've put on the breakfast list to hang on the door before going to sleep.

the staff couldn't do a better job. they were quick, courteous, smiling, polite and they didn't hover at any time or made certain trick to earn extra tips (such as coming two persons to a one man job, or staying in the room and keep asking if everything is to our satisfaction, etc. - you know the drill). but none from the staff we met did that at any time. of course my wife and i both agree on giving a generous tip at no less than 20% of the bill every time something is served, so we allso made it easy for the staff not to hover, and that should perhaps be taken into consideration, but we also find that people in sri lanka live on extremely low wages, and compared to the prices in denmark where we live, even an additional 20% still makes for a very cheap price for people living in europe, australia and north america, so i cost us so little but means so much to them, so there is no need to be a miserly cheapskate. if you can afford an expensive plane ticket and to stay in a somewhat pricey hotel like this you probably can also survive giving 500-1000 rps ($3-$6 usd) more when tipping the  waiter, room boy, luggage carriers, drivers, etc. it takes so little and being generous when tipping often comes back a thousand fold throughout your stay when you are being served by the grateful, hard working, staff at the hotel, trying to accomodate even your most extravagant wishes and habits.(that's just my personal opinion on this subject, and each to their own, of course).

i believe all rooms are non-smoking but most rooms are with a balcony (or a terrace if at ground level) so this is a comfortable hotel for smokers.",the large suites are beautiful and comfortable. stay above ground floor.,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,1,128,118,136,109

Mohit J,,Family,Water dripping off the ceiling | spoiled holiday,8/17/2025,"I want to share my experience (no so good) at The Heritance Hotel Anugila.

I along with my 2 sisters  had made a booking for the 3 of us for 2 nights 17th and 18th August 2017 at The Heritance hotel Anugula.

We checked-in the hotel on 17th Evening and were smoothly escorted to our room number 224.

1- On reaching the room we noticed that the floor was a little wet and asked for it to be cleaned with a delay of 5-10 minutes the floor was cleaned.

2- Tired of all the travel throughout the day, we thought of making some tea/coffee in the room, just to find that there were only 2 of all the things in the room. 2 cups, 2 glasses, 2 spoons etc. (for a room booked for 3).  Why would the arrangements be for 2 when the booking is for 3???

3- The electric kettle was placed in a cupboard which had no plug points. we had to shift the kettle to some other table to actually use it. But again to my surprise, the electric kettle plug (Flat pin) and the plug point (Round ones) in the room did not match.

4- My sister sat on the third bed to find out that the bed was actually not stable. If you sit on one side of it, it would lift up from the other.

5- We called up the rooms service for the above 3 points (2,3 and 4), but to my disappointment they could not have been slower. When you have a 5 star facility I would expect the staff to know English. The room service were not able to understand our plain English!! The room service addressed the plug problem, we made tea, and one of us had tea in a glass tumbler as there were only 3 cups in the room!

6- I went for a swim in the evening and came back to my room to take a shower. I land up in the bathroom to find out that there is no Shampoo or conditioner in the room!!!

I call up the reception for the same and they tell me they will send it to my room. I wait for almost 15 mins no hear no knock on my door. In the end I had to take a shower without a shampoo or conditioner.

7- At dinner that night, my sisters were a little disappointed as there were not much veg options (they both are vegetarians). The chef was there taking feedback and my sisters told him the same. The next morning we were to go for an early whale watching trip and had to leave at 5.30 AM. We had already asked the reception to pack our breakfast. Previous night, while talking to the chef, my sisters told him that we would be leaving early and to pack good breakfast for 3 (2 veg (for my sisters) and 1 non veg (for me)).

We woke up and were leaving for the trip. The reception handed over our breakfast nicely packed.

We opened the packets around 10AM on our way back from the trip to find out 3 non-beg meals!!!!! My sisters could not have breakfast that morning, thanks to the chef’s goof-up!

8- We reached our room, called up the reception for shampoo and conditioner (Which were still not there in the room). The room service comes to the room with an unlabelled bottle and said that was shampoo.  I asked for a hair conditioner and I am still in shock that he did not know what that was!! I explained what that was, and he said that they do not have a hair conditioner available!!! Believe me I am in shock as I write it!!

9- The day went on, we did not want to spoil our mood as we were on a 3 sisters vacation!

But the next morning when we woke up, we found out that the entire room was dripping of water (see pictures attached). The room had always been wet throughout our stay (as found on check-in) but it started dripping literally next morning. We had our luggage placed on the table above which the ceiling was dripping! All our clothes were wet! We had to quickly move the luggage from there to the beds. And then there was no place to sit.

I called up the room service to show them that, to hear a reply that we should not have the window open.

We were in a sea facing room and were there to enjoy the sea, not to seal ourselves up in an AC room. That we do anyway at our offices when we are not on vacation.

Why would you be in a sea facing room and not have the balcony or windows open??

I have not seen a beach side 5 star property of not having slippers or bathrobes in the room. I do not think these facilities should be provided on request. Isn’t it obvious that on a beach side resort the guests will go to the beach (or swimming pool) and would need slippers? Why should they have to ask for it??

Again still in shock - No conditioner!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

There are no plug points next to the bed!!!!! only 1 plug point far away fromt he bed. No multi-plugs available in the room. You have to call room service for that as well!

We were in Sri-Lanka for a 7 day trip, stayed in all 4 star resorts. We wanted our last 2 days to be special and relaxing and hence we chose a 5 star.

Our experience in all 4 star places was far better than these 2 last days!

BarsideBert,"Dublin, Ireland",Couples,Good but falls short of Excellence,1/17/2025,"My wife and I had a two week holiday here in December.
Weather was good and we did trips to Yala National Park (4 hours by car) and Kandy (4 hours by car). 

I list below the positives and the negatives of our holiday.
 
Positives :
Good food in restaurant buffet with a different daily menu.
Friendly and generally helpful staff throughout the hotel.
Excellent sea view from our first floor bedroom balcony.
Excellent sea front location offering lovely beach walks.
Two very large and spacious swimming pools kept clean.
Room very clean and some wonderful animal shaped towels kept us amused.
International plug sockets, always a help.
Good size balcony.
Much needed cold drinks upon arrival.
Clean sheets and towels daily.
Large 50"" TV in bedroom. (A negative for us as we don't watch TV but probably a positive for others).
Plenty of colourful bird life in the hotel grounds.

And so to the negatives.

No Jacuzzi for our entire stay.
When we enquired we were told they were waiting for a part but by the time we left the Jacuzzi was looking very grubby with gathered dropped leaves and rainwater.
Alcoholic drinks were expensive particularly a small glass of wine with dinner.
Costly alcoholic drinks turned up very quickly at dinner but not the free water.
On several occasions I had to ask three times for water.
Lack of local railway train information at reception.
No postcards sold at the hotel.
We had air conditioning problems in our room which took a while to resolve.
The plug in the wash basin didn't operate properly.
No curtain in the bathroom for the first three days of our stay.
Wobbly fan on the ceiling (maybe it was meant to be like that !).
Wobbly bedside table definitely shouldn't be like that.
Nowhere to walk to / have a coffee/beer/snack out the front of the hotel (busy road).
That's even if you manage to get past the tour guides who hover by the hotel gates.
Lack of lighting at night between the hotel front and the hotel gates.
Insufficient staff in the restaurant when busy. This was particularly noticeable at weekends.
Noisy building work being carried out on one wing of the hotel during the day.

Some of these points might seem petty but added together it wasn't the holiday my wife and I had hoped for.

Would definitely recommend Yala National Park.
A visit to a Turtle hatchery.
The Botanical gardens at Kandy.
The fort at Galle

Robin,"Mumbai, India",Family,5 star property with 2 star services,12/16/2025,"First of the good:

The people and the rooms are great. Very helpful and kind staff. Rooms have a great view.

The bad:

Co-ordination of our trip was very poor. We got in very late and realized that they only booked us in 1 room when our reservation said 2 rooms. They ended up finding a room for my wife and I, but it had 2 twin beds rather than a king/queen. Same goes for my parents room.

Food: Food was average at best. At a 5 (or 4 star) property, you expect the food to be excellent as you end up spending a lot of time just hanging out at the property rather than running around from place to place. Us being vegetarians was especially hard. We had the same 3-4 dishes to pick from. Most of them even seemed to be served from the meal before. The chef told us that we should have informed them of our dietary restrictions. However, from a 5 star resort, you expect them to follow up with you prior to your visit or during reservation, asking you of these things. Nothing of the sort happened. Of course, if they had followed up prior, the mix up with the room would not have happened either.

SajdaHussain,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",Family,Disappointed,12/16/2025,"We travelled with family on an outing, that had been planned a couple of months in advance. One of the members of our party is in a wheelchair and from the time of booking, this was mentioned as a special request. However, it was extremely difficult in getting confirmation from the hotel (both head office and hotel were contacted) if they were able to accommodate this guest. Several calls and emails went ignored and we resorted to calling a friend. This was extremely annoying as full paying customers you would like to think that the hotel would want to provide you with this basic service. A complaint made to the FB page provided some call back, but as always the trail went cold. We were unsure as to if this guest was able to make it, so in sheer desperation we had someone physically visit the hotel the week prior to our holiday and ask if they could be shown a few of the room categories, we were happy to upgrade if necessary. However, the person was not shown all categories and so the guest decided to only come for the day. Needless to say, we went there already disappointed with what the hotel had to offer. Once we checked in, we realised that one of our rooms was able to accommodate the guest in the wheelchair, and then proceeded to go to great lengths to ensure this guest joined us for the night.

Needless to say, I felt like reservations, front desk and the head office staff were negligent and incompetent in this regard. Thereafter our trip went along smoothly, the staff were friendly and courteous and cooperated with requests such as bringing out a birthday cake. The rooms were clean and the common areas pleasant.

Sanka C,Belgium,Couples,Great Architecture coupled with horrible management equals: We don't come back,12/16/2025,"We are a European Asian couple who came to Sri Lanka for our Winter vacations. We admire Geoffrey Bawa as a legendary architect and decided to come to one of the hotels designed by him to live his work for real. So We booked two nights in Heritance Ahungalla. 
Today is the second night of our stay and we just left the beautiful beach after the music reached the point of a super loud sound test. 

When we checked in we were made to sit and wait in front of a really loud bad music group. We complained a few times about the loud music right in our ear but they smiled and continued, forcing us to move away with our bags. Otherwise the treatment we got in checkin process was cool. But all the good mood was gone thanks to the awful music. 

Bawa designed his buildings in a way that the outside is coming to the inside and there are lots of open spaces. So really bad music in full volume means that you will hear it all over the hotel even in your own corridor. 

We complained more than 10 times and witnessed that other tourists were laughing at the music and walked away as far from the lobby as they could. 

The hotel management put really ugly ridiculous christmas decoration in the lobby and inside the beautiful infinity pool making, a big mockery of Bawa who designed the lobby so that you see the sea behind the infinity pool. 

The food was okay, nothing special other than a terrible vegetable chop suey and vegetable fried rice we got for yesterdays lunch. They have great freshly baked bread and spreads which we loved. And nice veggie burgers. 

Our room was interesting, as it seems to be originally as designed by Bawa years ago. The mini bar was dirty inside and the refrigerator quite rusty.
The wifi worked well for my computer every where in the hotel, but my wife had not as much as luck as i did. 

The staff were trying to give us a friendly face and some times we met nice people. A front desk guy called Khan was really funny and cool to talk to when he helped us secure the late checkout which we were promised via booking.com. 

The dining area got really wet under my own feet with lots of rain water this morning when it was heavily raining. Our corridor and the bar/ reception area was flooded because the roofs and windows were leaking.

They have amazing pools designed by Bawa and we used every opportunity jump in to them. The hotel is an architectural masterpiece and in a very cool location. However, the company that runs it seems to be treating this paradise for architectural lovers as just a another cheaply run 5 star hotel to use as space for mega groups they bus in to maximise profit. 

The loud music and badly maintained building may kill it for most. For us, we will not come again unless some miracle happens tomorrow.

the food was okay, nothing special other than a terrible vegetable chop suey and vegetable fried rice we got for yesterdays lunch. they have great freshly baked bread and spreads which we loved. and nice veggie burgers. 

our room was interesting, as it seems to be originally as designed by bawa years ago. the mini bar was dirty inside and the refrigerator quite rusty.
the wifi worked well for my computer every where in the hotel, but my wife had not as much as luck as i did. 

the staff were trying to give us a friendly face and some times we met nice people. a front desk guy called khan was really funny and cool to talk to when he helped us secure the late checkout which we were promised via booking.com. 

the dining area got really wet under my own feet with lots of rain water this morning when it was heavily raining. our corridor and the bar/ reception area was flooded because the roofs and windows were leaking.

they have amazing pools designed by bawa and we used every opportunity jump in to them. the hotel is an architectural masterpiece and in a very cool location. however, the company that runs it seems to be treating this paradise for architectural lovers as just a another cheaply run 5 star hotel to use as space for mega groups they bus in to maximise profit. 

the loud music and badly maintained building may kill it for most. for us, we will not come again unless some miracle happens tomorrow. we are extremely disappointed of the fate of bawa's hotel.",book this hotel if you need to crash not to enjoy bawa&#39;s building to the sound of the sea.,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,3,116,109,125,96

Ruwantha W,"Lisarow, Australia",Couples,"Excellent Location, Friendly Staff, BUT Not that Vibrant",12/16/2025,"I used to be a frequent guest since early 2009. This hotel used to be one of the best in every possible way. I should say that the location is great, with absolutely stunning views of the southern beaches of Sri Lanka. The architecture, flora and fauna gives a very relaxing feeling away from the commercial/business feeling. 

The staff is still very helpful, most would bed over back to entertain the guests. During the last visit with my wife they even upgraded me to their best suite, the Sachin Tendulkar Suite with no buzz or hazel at all. 

I must say, the rooms are of good size. 

But unfortunately that is where it ends!

The buffets are not up to the standards ( I am being very polite and generous towards the hotel here). Variety is lacking, taste is lacking, freshness is lacking. The edible items run over in 1 hour, so if you go there it late - you are left to trial the buns and sandwiches like parchment, and some left over stuff. As with many other hotels in SL they seem to cater a specific corporate client base, as a result the food spoils it for the relaxing holiday traveller. This is not just one time experience, but my observations over time. 

Restaurants and ala carte has little to offer. 

The ""best suite"" feels like collapsing on one end, not cleaned for days on another note, and worse of all even the renovation seems to be left at half way. 

Little activities happening at night, and the management does not seem to be interested in addressing it for years.

Last few visits all I felt is that the staff at junior positions, room services, and reception are trying to blow some warmth and energy into it, but the higher levels seem to be not bothered about what they offer to the clients. 

While I do believe, looking at the number of corporate customers in the restaurant (mainly East Asian and Indian - whom I have randomly come to contact with, have informed me that they are sent to this place via corporate arrangements, not by choice) that the hotel is likely making good returns and is not financially pressured to invest in restructuring and renovation; it makes me sad that this is like an aincient giant which is approaching its last legs.

Would I recommend it to anyone? 
Probably not if you are on your vacation. Given there are quite nice new boutique hotels in the area, for a fraction higher price point. 

Would I go there again?
Probably not, unless the hotel addresses these issues effectively, because it's a waste of time and money the way it is.",,en,positive,en,negative,unknown,unknown,"excellent location, friendly staff, but not that vibrant","i used to be a frequent guest since early 2009. this hotel used to be one of the best in every possible way. i should say that the location is great, with absolutely stunning views of the southern beaches of sri lanka. the architecture, flora and fauna gives a very relaxing feeling away from the commercial/business feeling.

              we have booked a triple room and checked in around 4pm but there were twin beds in the room and after repeatedly reminding them they finally added an extra foldable bed. the person who brought the bed looked like a senior for that area, when we complained he just muttered something like 'twin bed room is the only room type available at heritance when you book a triple room and we always add an extra bed , only difference is you will get meals for 3 people' and walked away rapidly, on us...
                there were no room amenities in the room- no iron or ironing board, no water for three people, no slippers ,toothbrushes, cups etc at all. when we needed something we had to call and wait and call again . ultimately one person appeared with a trolley and instead of replacing missing items asked us to take whatever missing in the room. and the dark color pillow covers were so dirty we just kept them away. no one has bothered to change them for ages .

M J,"Los Angeles, California",Couples,Poor accommodations,6/16/2025,"We finally decided to give this hotel a shot as we were traveling through the area mainly due to its architecture (Jeffrey Bower design) and location. Sadly this place failed us. Trivago lists the room that we were given for around $90 US. We paid $175 per night for the two day stay with the full understanding that we'll be getting a decent room. I was expecting much better accommodations given it's the off season and the hotel in near empty. Firt room we got was so bad that I refused it immediately.  They then moved us to a different ""deluxe"" room, as I was told, which was marginally better than the first one. The bathroom is dirty, no bath robes in the room and the view is sub par. The room is located in the far corner of the hotel. It is a smoking room and we were not offered the option to choose whether we needed a smoking room or not. It's puzzling to me that the hotel staff felt this room is consistent with a 5 star hotel. I'd rate this place and our experience at 3 stars at best!

I've given them two opportunities to rectify the situation and they utterly failed both times. They've had a golden opportunity to wow us and grantee a repeat customer but for some reason, that I still can't understand, they chose to make sure that we will not come back again. In this copetitive field, where there are many other options availabe, the accommodation we've received is not what I had expected from a Heritance chain (Kandalama in contrast was fantastic). We'll be in this country 3 more days and was hoping to to spend it in this area had they met our expectations. Instead we'll be moving to the Hilton in Colombo for the remainder of our stay. Needless to say that this is the first and the last time for us in this perticular facility. Situation of this type do not warrant a third chance.

Unfortunately you don't get swept off your feet at this property. Since we didn't get a booking at the VIVANTA by Taj in Bentota we thought we'd try the Heritance. 

The property is run down and seems to have seen better days. A renovation should be on the cards sooner than later. 

We were upgraded to a suite named after the legendary Sachin Tendulkar but unfortunately  the exhilaration of of the room or the hotel in no way matched the Little Master's batting. 

The room was ill-planned. No light switches and plug points in the right places, basins in which you couldn't splash your face, a Mini Bar fridge with a broken shelf, and never replenished, pathetic mal-functioning wifi...... and one could go on and on.... Minor glitches but collectively a huge nuisance for the price we paid. 

The biggest problem was the air-conditioning, never below 24 degrees Celsius. This in a hot and humid Bentota was a big problem. 

Two large swimming pools. Wow !! one for  playing and kids and one for peaceful and serious swimmers like me. A Great idea! However the pleasure was short lived when we entered the pool. The water was cloudy and had particles flowing in it. Temperature was like soup. 

The Gym was exceedingly ill-equipped for the number of rooms. Only two treadmills, one of which was closed non-functional for the duration of my stay. 

One large dining area for buffets. One fine-dining restaurant but we never saw a living sole there in the 4 nights we spent. The food at the buffets were exceptional,  but in case you're a vegetarian please be very careful. Options are very limited. 

Since large groups were coming in the buffet tables had huge queues. I for one am fond of nibbling tit bits going often to the table. But that was a Big no-no. 

Dealing with the lower staff is impossible. Not only is their a pathetic standard of English, many of them pretend to understand and say yes but things are not done. 

However I'd be failing in my duty if I didn't mention here, that the senior staff ably led by GM Mr Upul Peiris and the F&B Manager Gamini, were extremely courteous and helpful. Highly responsive.

For the third time in 6 days in Sri Lanka we were taken to a really horrid room (No. 228)!! OMG what a dump - we had paid for a king-size luxury room and what we got was a prison cell twin!! It was filthy, pokey, run down and utterly horrid. Needless to say we made a fuss and were initially told we would have to pay for an upgrade!! We were finally upgraded to a suite gratis. Unfortunately this was not much better!! The hotel is in a terrible state and is in dire need of major renovation. One of the biggest problems in this hotel is the design. This hotel is celebrated for it's design and architecture but in my opinion this is misplaced. All the bathroom walls are simply skimmed concrete which gives them a horrid dingy, dirty prison cell-like appearance. There were no curtains - just these filthy heavy shutters which moved in filthy tracks. The blinds were broken, filthy and flaking!! Pillows were stained. The remote control for the TV was held together with sticky tape, the hotel guide book was covered in sticky dried food, the chair at the desk was filthy and the mini-bar fridge was rusty and leaking water. The final straw was the insect life living in the room!!

We were tired, upset and ready to leave. By this time it was very late at night and we contacted our travel agents in UK and told them we wanted to return to UK asap. 

We were told there was nothing that could be done until the morning.

We spent a very uncomfortable night and waited to see what would happen.

Well; we had obviously stirred the hornets nest!! Next morning we were contacted by the front of house manager and within minutes we were surrounded by loads of staff members apologising and promising to make things right. After a short while we were upgraded again to a genuinely luxury suite which was lovely. Clean linen, clean floors, curtains and the biggest jacuzzi I have ever seen!! 

Throughout the whole process all of the staff at the hotel were wonderful and helpful and charming!! We enjoyed the rest of our stay.

DiH,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Friends,"Certainly not a 5*, but going there",3/16/2025,"Since I stayed in the hotel for almost a week with all inclusive package, I have had enough time to examine every part of it. 

ROOMS. 
It can be seen that the hotel is old. So are rooms. Even though staff cleans them regularly, you can't hide things like mold or very old and severely used furniture. 
Bathroom was clean, but not in the best shape either. Our neighbours had some creatures coming out from bathroom sink, but the issue was quickly solved by staff (so be careful and notify staff if you see anything weird). 
Rooms are not soundproof at all, so you hear all the noise from the hallway and from outside (especially, from a wedding or a ""private party"").

FACILITIES.
Pools and theirs surrounding facilities are fine. The only annoying thing are beachboys (some guys offering you tuk-tuk rides and women selling clothes). These people might follow you and annoy from day to day, but a firm ""no"" is ok for them to go away. Be aware that prices are higher than anywhere else. Also, be careful with the tuk-tuk guys. Negotiate the final price and all other aspects right away, so you won't get fooled in the end. They will tend to bring you to their ""friends"" (places, where prices are super high and tuk-tuk driver gets his cut), such as local ayurveda farm/massage, gemstone mine, souvenir shops, and some tea shops/ spa's. 
Beach is not populated - guests are swimming in the pool (which I found weird, because the ocean is so warm). 
Some (and again, SOME) of the public bathrooms around hotel stink like hell. They were clean, but that smell... I can still feel it. 

Also note, that the hotel is located in Ahungalla, which is not that famous for its tourist attractions. New hotels are being built, but it takes time until the whole tourist infrastructure will appear around this place. 

FOOD AND DRINKS:
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner buffets are fine. The variety of food is also fine, however, if you stay more than 5 days you will get bored with the food (it is different, but usually tastes the same). One great thing: desserts are marvellous! 
The barman at the pool bar is quite experienced and nice.
A la carte menu is somewhat average. Be aware, that ""service costs"" are usually will be between 25 and 50%, which I found ridiculous.

STAFF
Friendly, as mentioned before. Not all of them speak proper English, so if you have a question or a request - try to use simple words.
During the buffet, drinks are poured by waiters. From the day one I realized that you have to say twice if you wanted to have a drink, otherwise they would forget it. 
Some of staff saw my all inclusive bracelet and asked if I could get a beer/cocktail for them from a bar. 
if you want to use their taxi service, I highly recommend a driver named Nishan. Competent young man, who does not try to fool you. 
Overall, good experience.

CONCLUSION.
There are some positive things, but you can't say this hotel has five stars just because of friendliness of staff. Rooms, some facilities, surroundings, and other minor things don't make it a 5*. So, for this price you can find (I believe) something much better.

it can be seen that the hotel is old. so are rooms. even though staff cleans them regularly, you can't hide things like mold or very old and severely used furniture. 
bathroom was clean, but not in the best shape either. our neighbours had some creatures coming out from bathroom sink, but the issue was quickly solved by staff (so be careful and notify staff if you see anything weird). 
rooms are not soundproof at all, so you hear all the noise from the hallway and from outside (especially, from a wedding or a ""private party"").

facilities.
pools and theirs surrounding facilities are fine. the only annoying thing are beachboys (some guys offering you tuk-tuk rides and women selling clothes). these people might follow you and annoy from day to day, but a firm ""no"" is ok for them to go away. be aware that prices are higher than anywhere else. also, be careful with the tuk-tuk guys. negotiate the final price and all other aspects right away, so you won't get fooled in the end. they will tend to bring you to their ""friends"" (places, where prices are super high and tuk-tuk driver gets his cut), such as local ayurveda farm/massage, gemstone mine, souvenir shops, and some tea shops/ spa's. 
beach is not populated - guests are swimming in the pool (which i found weird, because the ocean is so warm). 
some (and again, some) of the public bathrooms around hotel stink like hell. they were clean, but that smell... i can still feel it. 

also note, that the hotel is located in ahungalla, which is not that famous for its tourist attractions. new hotels are being built, but it takes time until the whole tourist infrastructure will appear around this place. 

food and drinks:
breakfast, lunch, and dinner buffets are fine. the variety of food is also fine, however, if you stay more than 5 days you will get bored with the food (it is different, but usually tastes the same). one great thing: desserts are marvellous! 
the barman at the pool bar is quite experienced and nice.
a la carte menu is somewhat average. be aware, that ""service costs"" are usually will be between 25 and 50%, which i found ridiculous.

staff
friendly, as mentioned before. not all of them speak proper english, so if you have a question or a request - try to use simple words.
during the buffet, drinks are poured by waiters. from the day one i realized that you have to say twice if you wanted to have a drink, otherwise they would forget it. 
some of staff saw my all inclusive bracelet and asked if i could get a beer/cocktail for them from a bar. 
if you want to use their taxi service, i highly recommend a driver named nishan. competent young man, who does not try to fool you. 
overall, good experience.

conclusion.
there are some positive things, but you can't say this hotel has five stars just because of friendliness of staff. rooms, some facilities, surroundings, and other minor things don't make it a 5*. so, for this price you can find (i believe) something much better.

MMayKent,"Wilmington, United Kingdom",Friends,Could be better,2/16/2025,"As we pulled up outside the entrance to this hotel we were amazed at the view.  We were looking forward to some relaxing days.  We were shown to our room which was disappointing.  It had a poor view and the shower was in need of some good quality cleaning products, with the grouting all black and the glass door was covered in limescale.  We were so unhappy and disappointed (this was the third hotel in the group that we've stayed at on this trip) that we asked to be moved to a different room.  This was facilitated but we had to wait almost two hours for the replacement room to be ready.  This room had a much better outlook and whilst the grouting was cleaner, there was still the same issue with the shower door.  Some good limescale remover used regularly would work wonders.  That said, the overall cleanliness of the room was very good.  The room cleaning service was always good and the guys couldn't have been more helpful.

The pool and gardens are nice and the staff at the pool were very good.  On one occasion a man was in difficulty in the pool having wandered out of his depth, and the lifeguard on duty leaped to his aid.  A happy ending.  Don't be too worried if you see chipmunks and land monitors passing by.  Perhaps even the occasional monkey.  

We found the service at the pool bar to be friendly but quite slow, with some staff, on occasion, preferring to stand and chat together.

We ate in the outdoor restaurant twice and found the food to be pretty awful.  After those poor experiences we ate in the buffet restaurant.  I wish I could be more positive but I can only be honest - the evening meals were not up to the level of that at the previous hotel at which we'd stayed.  We found many dishes overcooked and almost cold.  At the dessert bar, only half the items were labelled, and if you went to eat after the main rush it felt like we were being given the leftovers.

First Breakfast: i wanted an omelette  I asked the chef to prepare ""well done"", but he became visibly irritated because I have explained in more detail. He said something in his language, evading after I asked him what he said.
I inspected the room where I was staying and found that under the bed were traces of visible dust probably old before those who have been staying here previously, the bathroom is not the bathroom of a 5stars hotel. The towels are to used and have old stains. On the ceiling we discovered traces of mosquito / dead flies on the ceiling of the bathroom
The beach behind the hotel filled with annoying vendors that are allowed by the security agents even inside of the hotel property limit.
We found the waiters mostly unprepared, lazy and disinterested. At the pool if you order a drink lasts an eternity. In fact, if you order anything in this hotel last an eternity.
The food at dinner buffet is an ordinary cantine  and you can easily see that they recycle the food from evening to another or is the same food.
The concept of all inclusive is a joke, because there are only a few types of local drinks and those bad.
Beach towels are to used and have old stains.

However, the food is typical of a normal restaurant. Not bad, but nothing special.
I have to mention that in the fine dining restaurant were only 2 tables with people. It was empty!
The new years evening was ok, but we wanted to order champagne and they told us they are out of stock.
We wanted Moet, they gave us Mumm. How can you not have stocks of champagne for New Years Eve?
The food was very good. If this have been the food for all the holiday i could have forgot all the other things 
 
At 14.30 in the nect day the room was not cleaned in the context in which We left at 9 am the room.
 I ordered a soft drink included in all-inclusive package, it was added to the bill and replaced at the my request.
Conclusion: if you're not careful pay twice. 
Wishing to relax at the beach we waited 30 minutes for the staff to find sun beds towels.
Another breakfast: I asked two omelets ( for me and my husband) everything OK, I asked him and the third omelets for my son and the cook was getting nervous. The adventure continues...

For sure the  hotel management will have a respond to this post, but it will not make any difference , because my new years eve holiday was ruined, so I recommend you avoid this hotel that can be classified as no more than one 4-star hotel!",,it,negative,en,negative,unknown,unknown,a big disappointment,"we arrived at the hotel after almost 20 hours by plane  and found out that espresso coffee is a special coffee and will have to pay, although it has the same taste and in no case was an espresso. i mention that we had an all-inclusive supplement and the coffee was included
first breakfast: i wanted an omelette  i asked the chef to prepare ""well done"", but he became visibly irritated because i have explained in more detail. he said something in his language, evading after i asked him what he said.
i inspected the room where i was staying and found that under the bed were traces of visible dust probably old before those who have been staying here previously, the bathroom is not the bathroom of a 5stars hotel. the towels are to used and have old stains. on the ceiling we discovered traces of mosquito / dead flies on the ceiling of the bathroom
the beach behind the hotel filled with annoying vendors that are allowed by the security agents even inside of the hotel property limit.
we found the waiters mostly unprepared, lazy and disinterested. at the pool if you order a drink lasts an eternity. in fact, if you order anything in this hotel last an eternity.
the food at dinner buffet is an ordinary cantine  and you can easily see that they recycle the food from evening to another or is the same food.
the concept of all inclusive is a joke, because there are only a few types of local drinks and those bad.
beach towels are to used and have old stains.

It's pointless of going to the same place (Kandalama) twice therefore we decided to go to ahungama heritance since it's all from the same family. 
There's about 220km from kandy (up and down both about 450-500Km) it was along trip. by the time we got to the hotel it was 5.00pm on 05/12/2015. We told the reception we have 2 bookings, one double room and one triple room. The welcoming lady was a fat girl and she was very rude to us she did not support at all even when filling the forms during the check in. and she took us to our rooms

Double room (215)was ok but the triple room was very small (216) and fully packed most of all there were only 2 beds, so when i inquire about the 3rd bed from that girl we said "" Ah.... ok i will send a folding bed for you"" As if like we are servants/slaves. I told her politely. I request for a triple room and I have already done the payment by visiting to your headoffice at aitken spence colombo. Her reply was ""all our rooms are this size there is nothing we can do"" I said if you put another folding bed here, there is no space even to walk in this room. Her reply was ""Sorry"" she said it in a way either you take the room or go home, and she went away saying she will send someone with the folding bed.
My mother said ""don't be mad putha we all came here to enjoy not to fight the other room(215) seems to be a bit large so we shifted to the next room. Then again I thought I already paid for a triple room and I don't get the service I wanted. If the hotel has only double rooms, they should have told me when booking. they never told me that.

I got mad. I called the reception and requested to connect with the manager. Unfortunately manager was not there and an executive officer was available named ""Chathuranga"" I told him about my situation. I have child about 10 months old. Myself mywife my child and my mother all are staying at this room, and the room is too small. he quietly listened to my situation and he asked me 5 mins and call back. then he called me and say ""sir we have a large room vacant you can shift to that room"" 
I was delighted we all went there to enjoy not to suffer and stay in a room like in a  prison cell. Then again I called to chathuranga and appologised him for getting mad and raising my voice what he told me shocking. he told me ""sir it's better you told me now rather than checking out, if so we couldn't have done anything for you.","If you don&#39;t like the room call the manager not the clerks, Managers thinks from the customers point of views and give you the best",en,neutral,en,negative,en,negative,excellent food but poor service.,"i'm from kandy. we (myself and my wife) went to kandalama in dabulla and had a great time so we wanted to take our parents as well.

Andy C,"Aarschot, Belgium",Couples,Really trying hard to give you a good experience,11/15/2025,"We visited this hotael for one week after doing safaris just to relax. I must say its been one of the stays that gave me very mixed feelings at the beginning. The hotel looks quote nice and delivered excellent quality in foods, the rooms are clean. Even though the hotel puts a lot of effort in pest control we had a bug problem in our room on the first day. After mentioning this our room was gladly upgraded and the previous room closed for very thorough treatment. It is always possible to have something like this when traveling to tropic countries. But we didn't experience any more problems after that. The hotel more then compensated our discomfort and that says a lot about how they want you to feel after your visit. If you're afraid of bugs its always better to get a room on higher floors. The food was of good quality, also the drinks. The main dining area didn't feel very cosy to us but this is easily solved by eating outside in the garden. Also try the vegetable pati for snack, its awesome. The chef showed us around the kitchen (we made mention something was labeled as vegetarian which contained fish) but they took this small mistake (we saw it before eating) very serious. They showed us around in the kitchen which also was very clean and they also have a small atelier where the do food / sugar sculpting of which they won many international awards. It's a shame they didn't give this more attention in the hotel. The garden has nice areas to sit but we were confronted with another pest the hotel was working very hard to control, local sales men. The beach is public and the sales men bite hard and don't let go. For us this proved to be very irritating since they sometimes became really aggressive (I almost got in a fight with one of them after  I didn't agree on a price he started calling me out, even when I was further on the hotel grounds). A mention to management about this and since then we saw police patroling the beach. Notice that you'll have this problem at any hotel because all beaches are public. This hotel at least tries very hard not to let this be a negative factor for their guests. So in short the hotel is good with the potential to become awesome. There are a lot smaller details (as everywhere) they can still improve on, but never have I been to a hotel that was so eager to get feedback from their guests and implement it. Just make sure to talk to them if something is bothering you and they will be very grateful and make sure you walk out with a good experience. Don't just put it on TripAdvisor after you go.

Negative: 
- Dirty beach; the Hotel does not care about the litter on the beach. Of course it is a public beach but there are only Hotel guests. Thats why they should clean it more often. 
- Beach Boys: they wait in front of the beach and even whistle or shout for someone. You always feel observed when you lie on the pool
- Rooms are in poor condition. In the shower is mould, the curtains are dirty and the furniture is old (i enclosed some Pictures). This is definitely not 5-star-hotel-like! 
- The Hotel customer Service asked if we could give them a good tripadvisor-rating and they want to see if you give 5 points. Thats certainly the fact why there are so many good Reviews. 
- The Prices in the Hotel (if you dont have AI) are quite high. A 0,3 Liter Diet-Coke is about 3 Dollar, the dinner 26 Dollar. Very much for a Country like Sri Lanka. 
- When you leave the Hotel there are some Tuk-Tuk-Driver who want to bring you to the next herbal-farm or wants to sell you drugs. After our second try, we did not dare to go out
-The Bar staff was quite slow and we had to wait almost 15 minutes till someone cared. That happened many times.

Neutral:
- Loud Room: We had a room over the bar and the bass was quite loud till 11 p.m. But most other rooms which are further away are certainly quiet. When we told this to the front desk they immediately offered another room

Positive:
- The architecture of the Hotel and the beautiful pools. 
- The Housekeeping and almost every Hotel employee was extremely friendly
- The animals in the Hotel. There where cute chipmunks, funny apes, lovely ravens taking their bath in the pool, a lizard and even a big snake (i dont know if it was poisonous) 
- great Food. I dont think that you can find any better Food in Sri Lanka

I just rate the Hotel with two out of five because it is made much better on tripadivor than it is for real.

Azure29,"Manchester, United Kingdom",Couples,Heritance Ahungalla Review,9/15/2025,"We spent six days in this hotel from Friday 18th September 2015 to 

Thursday 24th September 2015.

Overall, we were very pleased by our stay here and it was a welcome break as we had been touring Sri Lanka for the five days previous.

The hotel itself is very stylish in its design where the architecture is blended in with the surrounding environment. We particularly liked the wall along the main ground floor corridor which was open air with creepers coming down. 

Our room was on the first floor. It was a generous size with a massive double balcony overlooking one of the infinity pools and the beach.  It was stylishly furnished and it had good air conditioning. It had all the features you would expect such as a 
safe, tea and coffee making facilities, a good amount of drawer space, mini bar and plenty of free bottles of water.  The main down side to it was that it got pretty noisy, especially between 09:30 and 11:30.  It is directly above the pool bar, close to the 
reception area and every night, there was some entertainment there.  Any chance of having an early night was scuppered because you would get daily renditions of ""Lady in Red"", ""I can't help falling in love with you"", ""Wonderful tonight"", ""Yesterday"", 
""Strangers in the night"" and other modern classics in various different musical arrangements. Saturday night was really bad. The room shook for two and a half hours and you could hear every word of every song played. We were on the verge of demanding a different room but decided that we didn't want the hassle and 
ended up putting up with it as some nights were a bit more subdued than others. Looking back, I think we should have demanded a different room.  I think that the rooms further away from this area are probably very quiet and peaceful but if you ever get given room 226, this is what you will get. 

The amenities are very good but perhaps not of a five star hotel.  The spa was excellent. My wife had a Balinese massage which she thought was fantastic although the spa prices are equivalent to salon prices in the UK. The gym had some reasonable facilities, including rowing, running and cross trainer machines. It had a 
reasonable weights section.  The infinity pool and resident pool were beautiful. The resident pool is quieter and has a beautiful tree which stretches down almost inside the pool - pure genius in design. It also has a jacuzzi.  The hotel is in a fairly remote area and you need transport.  There is a resident taxi service and we were told that you can take a public bus or train, or even a private rickshaw. The hotel did not give out much information about local transport (such as timetables) and you could not book any excursions through the hotel. You were asked to deal individually with the resident taxis (which demanded prices nearly as much as UK taxi prices). We found the financial amenities we a bit limited. My advice is to take plenty of cash with you to Sri Lanka. I was hoping that the hotel would have an ATM but it doesn't. It offers a money exchange service but will not accept card transactions - it's cash only.  The nearest ATMs are a 10 - 15 minute drive from the hotel. Furthermore, we decided to pay our final hotel bill a day early and use up our remaining Sri Lankan Rupees for drinks on the last day.  Unfortunately, the hotel doesn't accept cash for food and drinks purchased. 

The hotel overlooks a beautiful beach although the sea is too rough and you are advised not to go into it for safety reasons.  The main issue was that there were various hawkers who stayed just the other side of the hotel boundaries. As soon as anyone stepped out of the perimeter to go onto the beach, they would get hassled by these hawkers wanting to sell them anything from garments, excursions, meals at their own restaurants etc.  The hawkers would employ typical marketing methods, such as following you, shaking your hand, calling you from a distance , beckoning and enticing the children of hotel residents as a way of getting a sale.  

The staff were excellent. They were very attentive and provided a great service.  The hotel customer relations managers worked tirelessly along with the rest of the staff. We felt very pampered.

The food and drink was exceptional.  The main restaurant laid out buffets for breakfast, lunch and dinner and they were of a very high standard.  There was a large range of choice: salads, Western food, Chinese food and Sri Lankan food. 
 
I would say that on the whole, the hotel is more suited to large groups and families.",Away from the reception area and bar area.,it,positive,en,positive,en,negative,heritance ahungalla review,"we spent six days in this hotel from friday 18th september 2015 to 

thursday 24th september 2015.

overall, we were very pleased by our stay here and it was a welcome break as we had been touring sri lanka for the five days previous.

the hotel itself is very stylish in its design where the architecture is blended in with the surrounding environment. we particularly liked the wall along the main ground floor corridor which was open air with creepers coming down. 

our room was on the first floor. it was a generous size with a massive double balcony overlooking one of the infinity pools and the beach.  it was stylishly furnished and it had good air conditioning. it had all the features you would expect such as a 
safe, tea and coffee making facilities, a good amount of drawer space, mini bar and plenty of free bottles of water.  the main down side to it was that it got pretty noisy, especially between 09:30 and 11:30.  it is directly above the pool bar, close to the 
reception area and every night, there was some entertainment there.  any chance of having an early night was scuppered because you would get daily renditions of ""lady in red"", ""i can't help falling in love with you"", ""wonderful tonight"", ""yesterday"", 
""strangers in the night"" and other modern classics in various different musical arrangements. saturday night was really bad. the room shook for two and a half hours and you could hear every word of every song played. we were on the verge of demanding a different room but decided that we didn't want the hassle and 
ended up putting up with it as some nights were a bit more subdued than others. looking back, i think we should have demanded a different room.  i think that the rooms further away from this area are probably very quiet and peaceful but if you ever get given room 226, this is what you will get.

mynewlifeistravel,"Nerang, Australia",Friends,The ants come marching,9/15/2025,"I had read so many great reviews about this hotel and was really looking forward to staying here,  and I somehow feel like I have stayed on another planet compared to the other people who reviewed here. I will comment that the Chef Sarun was fantastic and made the best meal we had in Sri Lanka, the gentleman who was serving us was very good. 
Now, the hotel is getting very tired and could use a renovation, I was first taken to a room with 2 single beds,  being a couple this wasn't good enough, but also laying on the bed it was comfy,  the second room had a double bed but was uncomfortable,  so we left it to the young man who took us to the room to try and sort out something else - either putting blankets under or a pillow top,  anything, we gave them 2hrs and nothing happened.  I went to reception,  spoke with the executive gentleman, who apologized and said we could look at other rooms,  apparently they only have 1 type of mattress which I don't believe. In the meantime I had ordered food from the restaurant and was told it would still be another 15mins away, we proceeded to the next room, same, next room same,  so I said I would settle just for the twin singles as we were only staying one night. He then said he would get a new room sorted out and have our luggage moved. When I got back,  my food was waiting and it was cold,  less than 15mins. I advised the waiter and he said thanks- what for ????? We waited 1hr for no key, went to reception and collected our new room key. Went to the room, located at the end of the hotel, and our luggage was not there yet. Next thing I'm looking at the table and there is ANTS EVERYWHERE,  now I'm talking about 1000+ all having a little party on the ground and under the table,  walking down the walls etc. I have plenty of photos which I will put up when I have better Internet at home. I rang front desk and we got moved again 2 doors down, we went for a swim for 1hr again,  come back and there was more ANTS in the room. We didn't get offered another room, but got dinner which is the only reason this gets a 2 star and not 1. We didn't sleep very well and the band / music was playing very loud well into the night. We had to check out at 7am, I had ordered a breakfast,  but when I went to check out, I was hauled to the cashier office, and they kept me there for 10mins arguing about the meal from the afternoon which was cold and I was told would be taken off the room, and, they also tried to charge me for a phone call from my room, which was the executive ringing the manager about the ANTS. The lady who apparently was guest relations needs to be sacked, the cashier needs to be sacked for trying to rip me off.

The hotel is a 4star property 

Mr. Pahan at reception was the friendliest face whose smile calmed me many a times

Beware of house cleaning who on three occasions walked in the room unannounced

Due to the climate the buffet area have a lot of fruit flies over the food at fruit and salad counter which is disgusting

Not many options for alacarte so best is to take a full board package

If ur a light eater then half board is good
Best part of food is the sri lankan cuisine

Pool is amazing and beach is untouched which are the two features i loved most
Overall de-stressing and relaxing 

Will definitely go back hoping for a better experience

nomienick,,Couples,Brilliant service!,2/15/2025,"We stayed here for 11 nights and were really impressed with the consistently great service we received. The staff are such a credit, and they really look after you well. We loved the quality of the food, and the breakfast buffet was outstanding. The room was also good, with a lovely view of the sea. There were a few small problems with the room but nothing major. For example, we booked a double but got a twin room instead. Also our safe broke a few times, but this was always fixed promptly. The main disappointment was not really with the hotel but the beach area, and lack of life on the beach - except for pesky sellers. We didn't really understand why there were no sunbeds on the beach. So we made use of the pool areas which were great, but not quite as nice as the beach. Although you do get to see some of the lovely wildlife in the hotel garden... iguanas, squirrels and even black monkeys in a big tree just behind the hotel. We were really surprised by how much we were hassled and harassed by the local sellers... not a fault of the hotel, although they do get a bit close in the pool area, which can be a bit of a nuisance. Just a warning - the locals don't seem to appreciate that tourists want to relax and not be 'sold to' all the time! They always have a hidden agenda, and when you ask them to take you somewhere you want to go, they insist on stopping at rip-off tourist traps where they can earn extra commission. So be prepared to say NO a lot!  If you are wanting to eat outside the hotel Hikkaduwa is good - it's a 40 min tuk tuk ride. You can haggle down to 1500 rupees return, but make sure you agree the price before you go or you could pay double - Even if you've used the same driver already!! Also, a great beach awaits you at Hikkaduwa... not the part of the beach where all the tuk tuks stop but a bit further along... just keep walking and you'll find a huge beach with surfers, plenty of bars and cafes, sunbeds etc. Beautiful!

Pros:
- well laid out and planned hotel
- swimming pool area is beautiful
- proximity to beach lovely

Cons:
- hardly any lights in room-very dim
- run down
- wifi not too great
- very sparse room-not even a coffee table!
- kettle had a calcified or corroded heating element so we did not want to take a chance with boiling water for our morning coffee. While it was well camouflaged, there was no plug point attached to the kettle so it would had to be physically moved near a plug point to operate-bad design.
- bathroom has windows with only dusty, uneven Venetian blinds for so-called privacy
- floor was dirty with dirt stuck on it
- room was smelling musty when we came in. Couldn't leave balcony door open for too long to air, due to mosquitoes.
- no room numbers written on key card envelopes-had to go out the door to check!
- no in-hotel numbers written near the phone
- cobwebs on balcony panels-rubber coming off
- hotel information papers in the binder were not in order-pages missing. 
- no in-room menu in room.
- checking in took time and we were shown a seating area that was impractical to sit in as sofas were not placed opposite of each other but next to each other. We stood around for about 10-15 mins and no one even asked us to take a seat at another more practical area which was close by.
- the man showed us everything in the room but to omitted to show us the balcony! We could not see it as it had opaque sliding type panels that covered the sliding windows
- the towels and sheets did not smell fresh
- hardly any vegetarian options in the menu to warrant the money so the only options were a la carte in the coffee shop and that were going to take 45 mins to order. That hardly seems fair for vegetarians, does it? Since there was no other option, we ordered 3 western choices from this menu. Unfortunately, we were disappointed with the quality and taste of all the options. The veg lasagne had pasta that was chewy, the pasta primavera had peas that were raw and the potato and bean 'pie' was in fact not a pie at all-just potatoes, onions and beans topped with cheese!
- The place needs a lot of maintenance.which it wasn't getting
- staff need to improve their English, esp since there are so many non srilankans visiting-language was definitely a barrier esp when it came to ordering food.
- staff need to be better trained to know what the hotel offers-boy who showed us to rooms said we could get a la carte in the dining hall. Instead there was only a buffet and no a la carte.
- in our room, 210, we had no locking system in the door inside the room-no latch or knob, so ostensibly, the master key could be used to open the door at any time from the outside, even while we are inside the room
- no tissues in tissue box in room 209-poor housekeeping
- took 20 mins and reminding a few times to get our coffee at breakfast

Lisa d,"London, United Kingdom",Family,"Tired, below average food and service but lovely setting",1/15/2025,"We travelled as a family and stayed in a deluxe suite, so had plenty of room.  The furnishings in the room were a little dated, and the hotel as a whole could do with a revamp.  There is a new luxury 5 star hotel being built next door, and I wondered whether the Heritance is gradually sliding to the rung below international luxury hotel, so as not to have direct competition.  The food and service here were definitely substandard in comparison to the other hotels on our trip (Ulagalla, Anantaya and Jetwing Lighthouse and Yala), and our son ended up with food poisoning on our last evening, nearly delaying our return home.  It was hard to get a table in the restaurant, and once seated it was hard to get the staff's attention for any drinks.  The hotel was not very responsive to requests (we had problems with ants in the room, a lamp not working and a couple of other things) but the boy looking after our room was very attentive.  Having said that, the hotel was very helpful about allowing us to use another room on the day of departure so that we could continue to use the facilities.  I think there was a laundry issue:  each time we asked for pool towels we were told there weren't any, but they did eventually materialise from a tumble dryer.  Service at the pool bar was extremely erratic and inconsistent - we usually had to walk up to the bar to get attention.  The stretch of beach by the hotel was lovely, and the currents not as strong as in some places, but still a risk for swimming.

edybinedy,,Couples,A matter of expectations ...,12/14/2025,"Heritance Ahungalle Hotel is a great retreat in Sri Lanka, but you must adjust your expectations before moving in.  

We had booked a de-lux room with balcony overlooking the beach and ocean  - romantic, eh?Unfortunately,  the hotel and consequently the room was very 'tired' and had seen better days.  The hotel even suffered poorly maintained sidewalks, tennis courts, beach loungers, etc. Most was simply under maintained.
Our balcony was adjacent to the rooms on either side, separated only by planters, and the view of beach and ocean obscured by a large (but beautiful) tree.  It may not have been a problem anyway, as on the second day of our stay, the hotel maintenance people set up a huge beach-obscuring marquee (JAG_68056) for another wedding.  They have about 20 weddings per year, so we learned.  Perhaps that wasn't so bad either, but the band wars (wedding band, bar music, and local flute player) that ensued developed an impossible cacophony of loud music which made it impossible to sleep.  

Our 'package' was directly booked through Heritance's  agent: bed and breakfast.  We soon discovered there were many alternate  'packages' which ranged from full board to 'good deals' offering better accommodation for less than we paid.  Check it out before 'checking in'.

The food was good, especially the buffet (good value and variety) ... but  the beach-hawkers were definitely a deterrent  from enjoying the beach.  The hotel should definitely do something about them!  They were ever-present from sun up to sun down.

The redeeming feature of the hotel was the always friendly and hospitable staff ... always willing to serve and support.  The Guest Relations team did their very best.

One last word of advice would be to insist that any Ahungalla-related transportation from Colombo Airport to the hotel take the new  highway ... it seems that the drivers attempt to circumvent the highway-toll gates by taking secondary roads which are long, uncomfortable, dangerous, and nauseating.

Raniya78,"London, United Kingdom",,Don't get too excited,12/14/2025,"I was attending a wedding held on 20th December 2014 and a friend of mine and I had decided to stay at Heritance. Coming from the UK I was keen to stay close to the wedding venue and enjoy the supposed five star luxury that this hotel boasted to offer. My friend a resident of Sri Lanka arranged the accommodation some five months in advance for us to stay from 19 Dec till 21 Dec, using Booking.com. However upon arrival, they didn't have our booking for 19 only 20. Some 45 minutes, emails and phone calls later I was given a room based on half board. The room itself was large and nice. A bit dark in decor but view of sea front was nice. The hotel is large however there is no clear indication of how the rooms are numbered on each floor. There is according to the member of staff showing me to my room a north and South wing again this is not indicated visibly so it's easy to get lost. The entrance of the hotel is stunning however the rest of the hotels falls in comparison. For four hours I was without WIFI, a number of phone calls later a staff member turns up and fiddles with my phone including switching my phone off airplane mode connecting me to my UK service provider and leaving me with a £40.00 data roaming fee whilst still not realising that the Wifi was an issue with the hotel and not my phone. After trying to relocate me to a new room much smaller with a terrible view I eventually head in hands and eyes filled with tears of frustration and tiredness, was placed in a more pleasant room with a bigger balcony that over looked the sea and the wedding venue. The sliding door which acts as a blackout was unable to fully close because the side table was too big. I had to move this in order for the blackout to fully close. The air conditioner controls were broken in all three rooms so I had to use my nails to switch off the air conditioner. The shower cubicle was placed in such a away that you had to get in close the door before turning shower on. The hotel toiletries were poor - the shower gel and shampoo were all placed in bottles that were not sealed and the soap was well rather useless. There were also no small hand towels or towels big enough to dry hair with. All in all two large bath towels and two hand towels. No bath robes either to sit and relax in. A basic I feel for a hotel claiming to be five star. The mini bar of the last room was broken and had never been checked so we found the drinks warm mouldy and in drinkable. The cost of a glass of wine in comparison to the bottle found in the mini bar also made no sense. It was cheaper in the mini bar. The dining room (only one restaurant in this hotel) was dark and dismal. The hot food area was hard to find until further inspection. The food was ok. A very basic selection. Nothing fancy or elaborate. The bar area outside by entrance was far more prettier yet the service was poor. 
Morning breakfast in the same dining room was a very dark and gloomy affair. The decor and seating was so basic and dark that you just didn't want to eat in there.
The only blessing was the guest relations officer Shanika who was so lovely and ever so eager to ensure we were happy that she went out of her way to do everything to make us feel at ease. 

We were on exit served with a $200.00 a night bill which I had to question over and over again. 

I am really sad to say that it was really shocked and disappointed by everything I had witnessed at this ""luxury"" hotel and having had a thorough read of what is expected to meet the international standards of a five star hotel - this to me is just a glorified bed and breakfast.

Definitely wouldn't go again or recommend. Yet the outdoor areas were lovely","Pointless in requesting any type of room beforehand. It didn&#39;t happen for us! As soon as we entered our room, there was a terrible smell of damp. On our balcony there was a white powder. I cleaned this up, and there it was again. It turned out they were decorating the room upstairs, and the &quot;powder&quot; was paint being rubbed down. You couldn&#39;t sit on the balcony without it getting on your clothes, and the stench in the room was really bad. In fairness, they said we could change room. I went to check and there was no smell or powder, and the room was prepared apart from bed and bathroom linen, but still they said it would not be ready for 24 hours.

Sandeep W,,Couples,Lovely location spoilt by the lack of customer service,11/14/2025,"After visiting the sister hotel in dambulla, I had high expectations for customer service. However I was sadly disappointed apart from a very few members of staff.

We arrived after touring Sri Lanka for our honeymoon for a rew days relaxation by the beach..
Dispite the local security we were often harrassed by the local ""beach boys"". A stroll on the beach was anything but relaxing. Although not a private beach the constant calling and shouting at by the locals was very annoying. Even after explaining we were on our honeymoon we were still surrounded by a number of the locals. Obviously this is made worse by the lack of security at the hotel, which allows locals to stroll around even to the resident only pool.

After on evening sitting for a pre dinner drink I noticed a number of flis around and which point my husband pointed the food and liquid on the adjacent table. After letting the staff know and expecting a prompt clean up, nothing was done about the mess. 
In comparison to other hotels within this chain and other hotels we stayed at the hotel was not well maintained. I never saw anyone clean the main lobby and bar areas dispite obvious mess. In fact e only time I say a brush was during a lunchtime of heavy rain to brush the water out and this was only done once.

There is a lack of information provided by the hotel. This could easily be rectified by adding a little more information into the room guide. Information about the surrounding area, places to visit and information about food within the restaurant.

The hotel food however was of brilliant quality. We enjoyed a meal at the fine dining restaurant and can say this food would not have been out of place at any top london restaurant. The food at the the al a carte restaurant was also of a good standard. The evening buffet was expensive and so we avoided this as we felt it would be poor value and probably poor service what experience we had of breakfast. Now breakfast was a terrible fair, although a wide selection of food not enough waiters or chefs. We came down for breakfast at various times, but noticed if we came after 9.30 no one was around to provide tea or coffee or chefs to cook the food. If we came earlier it was so busy we had to queue for the dishes and the cold foods we're not refilled often enough.

All in all this hotel has the basis for being lovely. The food was good, the views gorgeous, just a little more customer service and focus would improve anyone's experience massively. Maybe the staff here should vist kanadlama or the tea factory for some tips!",,en,positive,en,negative,unknown,unknown,lovely location spoilt by the lack of customer service,"after visiting the sister hotel in dambulla, i had high expectations for customer service. however i was sadly disappointed apart from a very few members of staff.

we arrived after touring sri lanka for our honeymoon for a rew days relaxation by the beach..
dispite the local security we were often harrassed by the local ""beach boys"". a stroll on the beach was anything but relaxing. although not a private beach the constant calling and shouting at by the locals was very annoying. even after explaining we were on our honeymoon we were still surrounded by a number of the locals. obviously this is made worse by the lack of security at the hotel, which allows locals to stroll around even to the resident only pool.

after on evening sitting for a pre dinner drink i noticed a number of flis around and which point my husband pointed the food and liquid on the adjacent table. after letting the staff know and expecting a prompt clean up, nothing was done about the mess. 
in comparison to other hotels within this chain and other hotels we stayed at the hotel was not well maintained. i never saw anyone clean the main lobby and bar areas dispite obvious mess. in fact e only time i say a brush was during a lunchtime of heavy rain to brush the water out and this was only done once.

there is a lack of information provided by the hotel. this could easily be rectified by adding a little more information into the room guide. information about the surrounding area, places to visit and information about food within the restaurant.

the hotel food however was of brilliant quality. we enjoyed a meal at the fine dining restaurant and can say this food would not have been out of place at any top london restaurant. the food at the the al a carte restaurant was also of a good standard. the evening buffet was expensive and so we avoided this as we felt it would be poor value and probably poor service what experience we had of breakfast. now breakfast was a terrible fair, although a wide selection of food not enough waiters or chefs. we came down for breakfast at various times, but noticed if we came after 9.30 no one was around to provide tea or coffee or chefs to cook the food. if we came earlier it was so busy we had to queue for the dishes and the cold foods we're not refilled often enough.

rooms were of a good size and clean. however try to get a room a reasonable distance from the lobby as this can be noisy especially on the weekend.

in general hotel is very tired and needs a refurb,looking shabby the public areas in particular,chairs and tables in bars and restaurants are sticky thru not being cleaned properly.
only really one main bar area next to main pool and reception this is completetely devoid of ambience and comforts hardly a good advert for checking in guests who are brought here.
the a la carte restaurant next to the main dining room while serving reasonable food is dirty with table runners stained and dirty when restaurant manager challenged about theis he quickly had it changed the same night our food came out cold ,not good for curries!the meal was remade but it was too late the damage done,they tried to make amends with a free dessert please  too little too late.
the main dining room is where we took breakfast and on one occasion a buffet dinner,the tables and chairs again dirty also the table runner.food wise the breakfast is good also the dinner buffet with plenty of choices available.
we tried the fine dining restaurant one night and it was very good my wife taking the new zealang beef and me the 2 fish curry price wise of course dearer than the other two dining rooms but light years superior which you would expect if you pay more but not expensive to European prices.
a bone of contention ,if you have a wine list then maybe the odd bottle is out of stock,but it got to the point all that was left was the expensive wines costing £25 plus for what we get at home for £6 now I know all about mark ups but rip off!
the daytime was spent by the resident only pool as this was the quietist and the pool attendant was very good at arranging our beds and towels on the same vain all the staff were very good one or two thrown in at the deep end I suspect with a poor lack of English in the restaurants.

Ill start with the positives. The hotel grounds are very nice, the pool is excellent, the location right on the beach very nice. The rooms are ok, they have everything you might expect or want. Nothing more or less.

However this hotel seems to follow the usual business model you find in these types of regions. Hire the cheapest staff you can find, provide only the basic training, charge the guests international rates, make a fortune on high margins.

Staff were slow and spoke very little english. They cannot engage in conversation which is frustrating when you need to ask about the local area, request extra food items, or anything you might require.

There was no imagination, such beautiful grounds yet no outdoor BBQ for guests during the day or night, outdoor pool bar, or even music.

And then there is the idea of apparent supplementation of hotel income by allowing corporate/local guests in with their families in tow on weekends. About 20 screaming kids in the pool and all the deck chairs taken forcing guests like myself to retreat somewhere else. I just dont expect this at a hotel that wants be considered in the luxurious category.

Food was overpriced for the quality. It was fine, just not what you would expect for the price. Staff would take away an empty bottle and just fail to ask if you wanted another. Basic stuff.

Staff are just in a constant state of apathy. I found myself having to look for the barman, find the guy to bring my wife and I the towels for the pool area. They were just never where you wanted them to be. When you did they were slow and emotionless.

And the hawkers waiting outside the hotel limits on the beach. I mean that put me off straight away. We couldnt go anywhere without being accosted by these people. If I want a poorly made garment Ill go the street market myself thanks. Other guests actually hesitated walking on to the beautiful beach just so they didnt have to interact with these people. How is that fair?

Upon checkout, my wife and I sat in the lobby area for 35 minutes as we waited for our driver and werent offered a single beverage/refreshment. Guess once you check out you arent worth the time anymore?

Given so many of us only have only a few weeks a year allotted for holidays due to work commitments, its heartbreaking not getting what you think you are paying for.

I think the Heritance Ahungalla has become complacent due to all the kind reveiws. When compared to the surrounding area it is 5 star quality, but internationally its 3 star at best.

Its not a bad hotel at all, just not that great. Therefore I gave it an ""average"" rating as its simply average. 

UPDATE: We have just checked in to the Fortress in Galle and it makes the Heritance look even worse. I wish we hadnt bothered with Ahungalla at all now.

Superb food both at evening and morning buffet.
Terrible points:
Rooms and bathrooms are outdated, dirty, smelly (sometimes smell of sewage is overwhelming) and ill-kept, some may be cockroachy. After one night I asked to change my room on the ground floor which totally awful to only slightly better on the first floor (at least with more light).
Housekeeping is poor: rooms are not cleaned until very late and then, several hours later, in the evening there comes house keeping again for god knows what reason. Also in the dining area at one point the floor was slippery because of spilt fat and remained so for at least two days.
Hotel spa prices are more than exorbitant, go for massage to the village. 
Beware when dealing in cash: bad exchange rate (and different than told at the reception) the cashier cheats (tried to swindle me and one of our group too), so count your money carefully.
Even when in the hotel grounds (and especially on beach) you are periodically accosted by touts, seller of various goods, tuk tuk drivers, etc. If you leave the grounds and go to the village you are immediately swarmed with “helpers” who tussle between themselves and finally you will have one fixed “leach” who will follow all the time offering all kinds of goods and services.

baldbrother,"Devon, United Kingdom",Couples,Excellence at Heritance,2/14/2025,"Just returned from an 11 night stay at Heritance Ahungalla and already making plans to return.
Check in was fast and faultless. The room was well appointed, spotless and, considering the amount of guests, quiet too. Efficiently cleaned daily (even the balcony), tea/coffee replaced, evening turn down service, couldn't fault it. Having spent a month travelling,in Sri Lanka, this was by far the best hotel of my trip. Breakfast buffet was something to look forward too with a superb and varied choice. The evening meals had a different theme with a massive array of western and asian dishes, all cooked and presented at a high standard. After a longish stay at a hotel, buffet meals can sometimes become a bit tedious with a longing to eat elsewhere, but despite several beach cafe choices, we were never tempted away from the quality food served at the hotel. Getting tea and coffee could require a bit of patience in the mornings but this is not logged as a complaint just a niggle when you need your early morning caffiene fix. The pools are amongst the best I saw in Sri Lanka, cleaned daily, the grounds kept neat and tidy and the beach vendors kept at bay by security and a respected boundry line although they do become a complete nusiance shouting and calling out to try and sell their goods but after a couple of days they tend to get the hang of who is worth pursuing and who needs to keep having sales tactics applied to. Beach is a beautiful mile plus of fine sand backed by palm trees and suprisingly free of plastic debris; not totally free but judged against standards of some asian beaches and the collection of bags etc that gets washed up, it's a gem. Only problem is that a walk along this beach is punctuated by the attention of several 'best friends' you never knew you had that want to get you to a cafe/gem shop/ tour but a firm 'no thanks' seems to be respected. There is a handy wine shop to the right of the hotel and several little shops that sell most stuff you could need but don't let any of the men that pounce on you the moment you walk through the gate follow you or continue any sort of converstion as they will be clocking a commission at your expense for taking you to the shop.

The staff at the entrance have always been very welcoming, and it is nice to see a few familiar faces when we walk in. The last few visits have been with our lil baby and they made sure that we are checked in within no time. Within a few minutes of us calling, a cot was delivered and set up. 
We are very concerned with the rooms being clean and free of any dust, The rooms were spotless and the toilets were very clear. 

The food at the fine dinning restaurant was excellent. It was quite obvious that a lot of attention to detail had been given. The level of service was even better. It was very kind of the waiter to push the stroller around with our baby to calm him down when he was getting a bit restless, Even the chef who came to the table to inquire about the food was entertaining baby with his hat. We did not ask either one of the to do this nor did we expect them to, This for us was going above and beyond the call of duty.

At the buffet we are always greeted at the entrance with big smile, the food, the variety and the service have all been of the highest order.

Martin D,,Family,"Overpriced, dirty and with no concept of service.  Weak link in the Heritance chain.",8/13/2025,"We stayed at the Heritance Ahungalla for 4 nights in August 2013 at the end of a 2 week visit to Sri Lanka.  The Heritage Ahungalla is the only hotel where we experienced poor service and poor housekeeping and felt that the hotel did not live up to its literature (website).  Things started badly and unfortunately certainly did not improve.
On arrival only some of our party of 5 were offered hospitality and this itself was done unsatisfactorily, being given before the hand towels were provided.  A small blip but, as it turned out, indicative of what was to follow.
The check-in process was acceptable, slightly slow but not beyond what was reasonable.  The assistant (off his own back) confirmed that my wife and I would be in one room and our 3 children in another room (as we had booked).
We were then shown to our two “luxury” rooms.  The children were allocated an incredibly large room with a double bed for the girls to share (not uncommon in Sri Lanka) and a separate bed for our son.  No complaints there.  My wife and I were then taken to our room.  This was approximately half the size, and had twin beds pushed together to resemble a double bed – with a double bed headboard and the top blanket pulled across the pair – but there were undeniably two separate beds.  It was hard to believe that the two rooms were of the same category.  It was also perplexing that the hotel had designated the rooms as they had and, most of all, astonishing that they had not put my wife and me in the room with the double bed (the other room was still plenty large enough to accommodate the children).  We raised the matter at reception but were told that nothing could be done; no double bedded room was available for us.  The only thing the hotel suggested was that we could swap rooms but by that time everyone had unpacked and settled in and (quite apart from the obvious inconvenience entailed) this reversal would hardly have gone down well with the children whose expectations had been raised by what the hotel had given them in the first place.
Dinner: Unlike everywhere else we stayed, the main restaurant (the Jute) did not offer an a la carte dining option, only a buffet, although the in-room literature (itself in a ragged state) indicated it did.  To rub salt into the wound, the buffet was very expensively priced compared with the other comparable hotels we stayed in.  It then emerged that the policy on what rate to charge for children was seemingly wholly arbitrary and depended on whether one asked about it.  The default position was a full/adult charge but when this was queried a concession was immediately made for the children, this being apparently down to the attitude of the particular manager in question.
We chose to dine in the Mustard Coffee Shop (a much smaller establishment) where one can purchase individual dishes.  The food was acceptable but of a distinctly lower quality than we had enjoyed elsewhere.
Breakfast: This (included in our package) was provided in the main restaurant.  The food was ok and there was a fairly good selection.  However, the service was undoubtedly by far the worst we experienced during our holiday.  Quite simply, there appeared to be too few waiters.  It often took quite some effort to order tea and to have dirty plates etc. removed – in marked contrast with the attentive service consistently shown at other hotels.  Also, it appeared that the hotel provided breakfast for substantial numbers of non-residents (attending conferences etc.); this made the restaurant particularly busy and not the place for a restful, relaxing meal.
Housekeeping: A joke.  Our room had not been properly cleaned on arrival; there was sand all over the towel hook.  We had to call twice to have it seen to.  Our request that a blown light bulb be replaced was never met.  The second day was ok.  However, on the third day housekeeping did not come to either room.  It took 3 calls from us to get them to clean the rooms – which they did eventually in the late afternoon.  Further, they failed to leave any bottles of water in the children’s room, even though they had done so the previous day and despite the fact that on the same occasion they left fresh water in our room.  When our daughters asked for a supply for them (to brush their teeth etc.) they were told that water was only provided free-of-charge for the first night and that thereafter it must be purchased.  This was a clear fob-off (inconsistent with and contradicted by the hotel’s own actions on other days and in relation to our room).  It took intervention from my wife to get this issue resolved.
Down the corridor some other guests had spilled fruit over the floor.  Housekeeping, along with a trolley of cleaning materials, passed by the scene but failed to clear it properly.  Eventually we asked for it to be cleaned.  When we left there were still watermelon seeds on the (sticky) floor.
Pools: The main pool (featured on the website) is open to non-resident guests and can become very busy, meaning that in effect you feel confined to using the second pool.
Check out: We had to leave at 4.30 a.m. to catch our flight.  I told the hotel this and settled our account around 10 p.m. on the final evening.  The hotel thus knew our plans.  At 4.30 the following morning we all trooped to reception with our cases and I handed in our keys.  It was clear to the staff that we were leaving then.  We waited in front of the desk with our cases for our taxi to arrive.  There was no sign of it; the forecourt was empty and there was no vehicle visible.  After 10 minutes or so my wife asked the reception to telephone the taxi company for us.  Only then did the staff inform us that the taxi had actually arrived some time ago and was parked in a dark corner with all its lights and engine off!  Why they did not volunteer the information before is a total mystery.  It was sheer good luck that we asked them to make the call for us (rather than trying to call the tour company ourselves); otherwise we could have been waiting at reception indefinitely, oblivious of the fact that the taxi was just some yards away!
Indeed, when we were on the road the taxi driver told us that due to some confusion (for which the hotel was not responsible) he’d been booked to arrive at 2 a.m.  On arrival – having entered via the security-controlled gates – he had told the staff.  Why they had not seen fit to call us in our room to notify us is again utterly inexplicable.  It is just typical of the absence of service we experienced throughout our stay.
All in all: the Heritance Ahungalla should be avoided.  It is very much the weak link in the Heritance chain (we stayed at Heritance hotels in Kandamala and Nuwara Eliya which were both good).  By all means visit Sri Lanka – but I strongly suggest you find somewhere else to stay.",Book a different hotel.,en,negative,en,positive,en,positive,"overpriced, dirty and with no concept of service.  weak link in the heritance chain.","we stayed at the heritance ahungalla for 4 nights in august 2013 at the end of a 2 week visit to sri lanka.  the heritage ahungalla is the only hotel where we experienced poor service and poor housekeeping and felt that the hotel did not live up to its literature (website).  things started badly and unfortunately certainly did not improve.
on arrival only some of our party of 5 were offered hospitality and this itself was done unsatisfactorily, being given before the hand towels were provided.  a small blip but, as it turned out, indicative of what was to follow.
the check-in process was acceptable, slightly slow but not beyond what was reasonable.  the assistant (off his own back) confirmed that my wife and i would be in one room and our 3 children in another room (as we had booked).
we were then shown to our two “luxury” rooms.  the children were allocated an incredibly large room with a double bed for the girls to share (not uncommon in sri lanka) and a separate bed for our son.  no complaints there.  my wife and i were then taken to our room.  this was approximately half the size, and had twin beds pushed together to resemble a double bed – with a double bed headboard and the top blanket pulled across the pair – but there were undeniably two separate beds.  it was hard to believe that the two rooms were of the same category.  it was also perplexing that the hotel had designated the rooms as they had and, most of all, astonishing that they had not put my wife and me in the room with the double bed (the other room was still plenty large enough to accommodate the children).  we raised the matter at reception but were told that nothing could be done; no double bedded room was available for us.  the only thing the hotel suggested was that we could swap rooms but by that time everyone had unpacked and settled in and (quite apart from the obvious inconvenience entailed) this reversal would hardly have gone down well with the children whose expectations had been raised by what the hotel had given them in the first place.
dinner: unlike everywhere else we stayed, the main restaurant (the jute) did not offer an a la carte dining option, only a buffet, although the in-room literature (itself in a ragged state) indicated it did.  to rub salt into the wound, the buffet was very expensively priced compared with the other comparable hotels we stayed in.  it then emerged that the policy on what rate to charge for children was seemingly wholly arbitrary and depended on whether one asked about it.  the default position was a full/adult charge but when this was queried a concession was immediately made for the children, this being apparently down to the attitude of the particular manager in question.
we chose to dine in the mustard coffee shop (a much smaller establishment) where one can purchase individual dishes.  the food was acceptable but of a distinctly lower quality than we had enjoyed elsewhere.
breakfast: this (included in our package) was provided in the main restaurant.  the food was ok and there was a fairly good selection.  however, the service was undoubtedly by far the worst we experienced during our holiday.  quite simply, there appeared to be too few waiters.  it often took quite some effort to order tea and to have dirty plates etc. removed – in marked contrast with the attentive service consistently shown at other hotels.  also, it appeared that the hotel provided breakfast for substantial numbers of non-residents (attending conferences etc.); this made the restaurant particularly busy and not the place for a restful, relaxing meal.
housekeeping: a joke.  our room had not been properly cleaned on arrival; there was sand all over the towel hook.  we had to call twice to have it seen to.  our request that a blown light bulb be replaced was never met.  the second day was ok.  however, on the third day housekeeping did not come to either room.  it took 3 calls from us to get them to clean the rooms – which they did eventually in the late afternoon.  further, they failed to leave any bottles of water in the children’s room, even though they had done so the previous day and despite the fact that on the same occasion they left fresh water in our room.  when our daughters asked for a supply for them (to brush their teeth etc.) they were told that water was only provided free-of-charge for the first night and that thereafter it must be purchased.  this was a clear fob-off (inconsistent with and contradicted by the hotel’s own actions on other days and in relation to our room).  it took intervention from my wife to get this issue resolved.

DilT2,"Sri Jayawardenepura, Sri Lanka",Family,"An ""OK"" holiday",7/13/2025,"The beginning of the holiday started in a very disappointing way. We arrived at the hotel at 2PM on time for check in. However we were informed that the rooms were not ready. As a result we had to wait for over two and a half hours to get our rooms which was a very disappointing experience to start a vacation.

The excuse given by the staff was that the guests have not vacated the rooms on time. This is not a plausible excuse. The hotel should know when to call and inform guests that they need to check out on time. The least they could do then is call us and let us know there is a delay so that we can plan to arrive late to the hotel.

My mother who is elderly had to sit for along time in the reception area and found it difficult to walk afterwords as well.

We actually decided never to come back to this hotel again but we changed our minds after the experience afterwards.

The staff in the hotel mainly the room maintenance and restaurant staff were very polite friendly and courteous. Never before had we experienced such a good service from staff in any other hotels we had been to.

Another plus point was the food. The food was excellent. There was a wide variety and it was very tasty. One negative aspect is that we stayed one night on a day where there were less guests. On this day the food variety was not there and that was a bit of a undermining experience for us.

Another unsatisfactory experience I faced was with the pool attendant. When I went to the swimming pool I asked the pool attendant for a towel. His reply was that the hotel had instructed him to inform guests to bring their room towels. This seemed very odd to me as I saw other patrons having pool towels. Anyway I proceeded to have a swim and I could not  dry myself as I had no towel and I had to go to the room all wet. With the cold wind blowing I could have got pneumonia as well but thankfully that didn't happen.

Later on I called the reception to clarify this and they said that the pool attendant should have given me towels and that he had given me false information. In any case I do hope the hotel takes this experience as a learning and inform their pool attendants as to not to refuse to give patrons pool towels.

Finally I would like to say that the hotel did allow us to have a late check out in order to compensate for the delayed check in.

Overall I would say that I would come back to Heritance Ahungalla due to the friendly and polite staff and the good food. However I hope that I will not face the unpleasent expeirnces I mentioned above, the next time I visit..

It has two pools, one near the main foyer and another one in a quieter spot - you can't see the beach from this pool but it is nicer and used more than the other one. 

We checked in on a Sunday afternoon - although it is low season, during the weekends the hotel is still fully booked due to package specials. This meant the reception was very busy when we got in and may be why we were allocated a poor standard room initially. It was dirty and had an overpowering musty smell - we were very disappointed, but fortunately after a few hours we were able to go in a much nicer room without the smell and a good view over looking the ocean.

We generally felt that our stay here was below the quality of stays we have had a similar resorts. Some staff went out of their way to make sure our stay was enjoyable, but then some staff were not as accommodating. For example there are hawkers from the beach that come up in to the resort, so that when we were relaxing they would be yelling out to us to buy their wares - there is a security guard there so it is hard to believe they are even allowed to do this. We were even more shocked when one of the pool attendants actually encouraged us to buy a shirt from one of them!

This property has always been on our list of hostelries and we do enjoy the ambience.  Service is dependable and the food above average.  The rack rates are on a par with similar European hotels and you will certainly be relieved of a lot of Dollars or Euros during your visit.  And of course, the staff is paid at the prevailing poverty rate of Sri Lanka so the margin for this hotel must be handsome.

I suppose that the hotels theorize that throwing our money away on these insignificant ""treasures"" makes us feel socially superior.  As a result of this, and on principle, my party avoids the handy bandits like a plague supplying our own snacks purchased at a mom & pop store on the way and use the bandits for storage.
  
So it came to pass that I nonchalantly reached in for one of our Snickers and was horrified half way through that I realize that I had actually grabbed the hotel Mars Bar. So quickly I replaced it with one or our Snickers which was why the cashier at check-out time contracted a severe case of apoplexy when the chamber boy dramatically reported that he had found a desecrated Mars Bar wrapper in the trash and that a Snickers had been substituted.
 
To give you perspective on the severity of the cashier's grand mal seizure, a Mars Bar, at 51 grams of sugar, waxed chocolate and fat, sells at 300 rupees, [current exchange rate = $2.37, mom & pop price 85 rs, 7 cents USD]).  Through his glazed eyes the cashier could see a lost 353 % markup margin leading to corporate bankruptcy, for which he would undoubtedly be held responsible.  The replacement Snickers at 57 grams (mom & pop 150 rs [$1.19 USD]) seemed not to appease him at all.  Perhaps it was the total combined hotel bill of over $2,133 that clouded his aleertness and in the confusion we slipped out to our chauffeured car with instructions to the driver to out race the police if need be.

this property has always been on our list of hostelries and we do enjoy the ambience.  service is dependable and the food above average.  the rack rates are on a par with similar european hotels and you will certainly be relieved of a lot of dollars or euros during your visit.  and of course, the staff is paid at the prevailing poverty rate of sri lanka so the margin for this hotel must be handsome.  and yet we always marvel at how efficient and professional the staff is considering their vastly underpaid salaries.

RukshilaG,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",Friends,Heritance Ahungalla - To Rejuvenate,5/13/2025,"We visited Heritance Ahungalla recently and observed some pros and cons that might be useful to point out.

Pros. 

1. As the room was booked as a part of our anniversary, we were given the most spacious room of the category and really loved every bit of it. It was cozy and relaxing. Our favorite part was how it seemed to be a sort of a separate building to the main hotel and opened up to the jacuzzi and resident green pool. 

2.  The hotel in general was very relaxing and spacious and never felt like it was crowded. well probably because it wasnt! but either way even if there was a heavy crowd it felt like you had your own space.

Cons.

1. TV - Ofcourse you dont come on a holiday to watch TV BUT it would be great to have a few good options. The cable tv had very few channels excluding some of the most entertaining movie and tv show channels which I thought was a bit of a bummer.

2. The food was not great and not bad. Average I must say. We expected a large spread but it seemed that since it was off peak season and less crowd also because it was a weekday, there was very little variety and thereby ""threw a dagger"" to our expectations.

Dayna G,,Couples,Lovely staff..,3/13/2025,"HOTEL: 
We stayed at the Heritance for 10 Nights. The hotel and staff are lovely. After reading a previous review about being to scared to leave the room, i feel that this is an insult the the hard working staff there. At no point did we feel we threatened by staff, housekeeping staff smiled and never asked for a tip and the same said with the staff in the bar area.
I suppose the hotel could do with a lick of paint but as for broken sunbeds i didnt see any, and there was always loads to choose from.
The only negative thing about the room is the size of the fridge which is very small. But again it wasnt a real problem.

YES.. you tip for most things but we never felt preasured to do so, and even if you do its 100rs at a time! The sellers on the beach are a bit of a pain, but a firm no and they go off to the next person, and after a while getting the same response from us they didnt even bother. Our room was on the 3rd floor and it was lovely, and we even had our own little gekcho which was great for eating insects. Our room was cleaned twice a day with clean towels and more water.

The food was lovely, the only downside is there isnt much options for vegitarians.
The only major downside with ther Heritance was location. when we travel we like to go out and try local resturants which is why we booked b&b, however other then the little fish resturant (which is cheap with lovely food) along the beach there isnt anything walking distance. We did take a taxi RS3500 (that waited 3hrs and brought us back to the hotel) to Hikkaduwa where you'll find bars/resturants and several rotty cafe. 
If we'd of known this we would of booked HB as we ended up spending most evenings eating in the hotel.
TOURS:
We did several trips whilst in Sri Lanka. The first to Uda Walawe park, as much as it was a long drive it was lovely to see the elephants roaming around freely, its def worth a visit.
We then did a 2 day trip to Kandy and Sigiriya again a lot of driving, we stopped off at a tea shop on the way which was ok, then the botanical gardens which is a lovely place to sit with an ice cream and watch the world go by. We then went to the temple of tooth which was lovely, and to be honest go without a guide as ours was a bit of an idiot trying to get us to pay for him to study etc etc.. which we felt was very cheeky whilst inside a buddhist temple!!! In Kandy We stayed at Chaaya Citadel which was lovely and great food, to be honest it was a shame we only stayed the night.
The next day we had an early start and more driving to Sigiriya, this was via a spice market and to be honest at 830am we probably wasnt the most awake customers!! but we listened and left!
Once we arrived at Sigirya we headed up the many steps in the mid morning heat!!! the views at the top are lovely and make for great photos, they even had a family of monkeys that live on the top. Then it was the 7hr drive back to the hotel. Be warned your driver will take you to various tea/gem and spice shops!!!!

fenixnox,"Hong Kong, China",Friends,WORST HOTEL EXPERIENCE. EVER.,3/13/2025,"We stayed at this hotel for four days and it was the worst hotel experience ever. A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY AND A VERY EXPENSIVE DISASTER!

I recommend reading the lowest reviews for this hotel before you book; there is a real discrepancy between the nightmare reviews and those that are praising this hotel. Make sure you understand what is the worst that could happen to you also if you choose to stay here, because the worst scenario did happen to us. We did not read what the low ratings on Tripadvisor said about the Heritance Ahungalla. We wished we did because so many of these complaints reflect our experience.

My friend and I are both seasoned travelers, and have stayed in both five star accommodation and budget ones, all over the world. Given the cost of staying at this hotel, we were both incredibly disappointed and also traumatised during their stay. We felt so uncomfortable and threatened during our stay that we locked ourselves in our hotel room.

We have lodged a formal complaint to the travel agency about our stay at the Heritance Ahungalla. Our main complaints are as follows:

- Worst service: for the entire duration of the trip, the staff was incredibly rude. There was no ‘hospitality’. The staff pestered us repeatedly for tips, from the receptionist to cleaning staff to waiters. When we made all the complaints listed below to the staff, we were completely ignored and were shouted at. No attempts were made to apologise or to resolve the problems. We were incredibly frustrated by this, and were very close to tears.

- Terribly unhygienic: stained bedsheets, dust and mould. Restaurant tableware and cutlery was not cleaned properly and had stains.

- Pests: cockroaches, flies and mosquitoes in the bedroom and the bathroom. 

- Touts: The hotel was full of touts, from the pool to the beach, also pestering us and other guests to buy their goods. At one point, one of the touts even made a completely disgusting sexual advance on my friend! The hotel made no effort to safeguard the safety and/or privacy of their guests.

- Food: the food was always lukewarm at best, and/or cold. Food would take at least 45 minutes to arrive. We ended up eating only burgers and fries for the four days that we were there, as it was the only food we felt was safe. For a holiday experience, this was disappointing. It would have been better to have just eaten McDonald’s.

- Bad facility condition: The hotel is quite old, and many parts require fixing. A number of sunbeds were broken and completely unusable.

We will never stay there again and are warning everyone who visits Sri Lanka to avoid this place. If you plan on staying there, at least read both the good and bad reviews to decide for yourself. There is a higher risk staying at this hotel, because of its location. It is incredibly far away from Colombo and any other properties, so if you arrive here and the hotel is a complete disappointment, there is no other property that you can escape to.

We loved the place. The hotel design is unbelivable. Stunning as you arrive at the reception. The blue pool and sea are seen in one veiw. Great. The rooms were large and very comfortable with wifi. Resturant and food very good. There are 4 restaurants. The most striking thing was the service. Unbelivable. People so responsive and freidly.

The staff are welcoming and immediately cannot do enough for you.  We arrived tired and fed up after finding no room for us at Jetwing Lighthouse despite a booking being made April 2012 (see separate review).  The hotel was about to welcome the Sri Lanka and Bangladeshi international cricket teams and although there was great excitement we were made to feel just as important.  We were told there would be extra security but this did not affect us at all.  Bearing in mind we were not expected we had a fabulous 3rd floor upgraded room overlooking the sea and the pool.

The choices at dinner and breakfast could not have been better and when I asked for some French cheese the chef apologised and said he would try and get some for the morning.  Although it did not appear at breakfast the enthusiasm was there.

How long are you staying?) before swiftly moving on to the HARD SELL (for tours, tuktuks, souvenirs,  restaurants, etc), or muscling in on trying to carry your shopping and gathering around when you get your change in the hope of receiving some cash.

I am expecting the mandatory response from the hotel manager (does he really write these Trip Advisor responses?!), saying the hotel is working with the touts to improve the experience for guests... if this is true (and it seems to have been ongoing for some time), it simply is not working.

crazylass,,Couples,Very disappointing,11/12/2025,"After a week of touring around Sri Lanka for the first part of our honeymoon we were looking forward to spending a week by the sea in a 5 star resort. Unfotunately we were very disappointed with this hotel. The good points about the hotel are the large swimming pools and the view of the sea from most parts of the hotel. 
The bad points are numerous:
-During our stay the weather was very windy and it rained heavily. The hotel is not designed to cope  heavy rainfall as it is designed in a very modern, open minimalist way. All the corridors, a bar and the cafe are completely open to the elements. This meant that rain was constantly pouring in and the floors were several centimetres deep in some places. This made the floors very slippy and we found we were unable to get around the hotel much and it made sitting in the front bar and cafe impossible as the bar does not have any front covers to keep the rain out. The staff are constantly sweeping the water away and moving furniture around out of the rain which was very irritating. The overall cleanliness of the hotel is not that great either and the hotel is starting to look rundown. The bathroom in our room had lots of mould in the shower(picture attached), and there was no bath option, you have to pay for a premium top floor room to get a bath! Having stayed in many 5 star and 4 star hotels all over Europe and Asia, I would say this is a 3 star at best, the other 3 star hotels we stayed in during our holiday were in fact much better. 
-The food is boring and pricey by Sri Lankan standards although you would expect that in a 5 star hotel. We went to the fine dining restaurant one night which was pretty good, although very run-of-the-mill options such as steak and mash. The desserts were interesting but after waiting over half an hour, when they arrived they were poorly executed and my dessert was not even what I ordered. Being the only other couple in the restaurant this was certainly not what we expected. The breakfast is also disappointing, the only positive being the traditional Sri Lankan curries offered. The omelette queue was impressive every morning and that only left under-cooked waffles, anaemic chicken sausages and fatty bacon cooked to order. The rest of the buffet was luke-warm at best. The fresh fruit offered however was fesh and ripe and there was lots of choice.
-The beach is not for swimming or being on for any length of time. There are local people constantly waiting on the edge of the hotel and the beach trying to sell you things aggressively and stray dogs wandering about do not make you feel safe. The security guards do nothing about the sellers and leave them to shout at you whilst you are lying on sunbeds within the hotel grounds.
-Another point to make is that there is nothing to do in the local area- we went to the 'turtle hatchery' before going to the hotel and it took us 10min to look at the 2 ponds in which 2 poor adult turtles are kept, and a small area of sand where the eggs are buried before they hatch.  

We ended up leaving early as we were fed up with the food, not being able to go on to the beach and the inefficient staff. 

Wish we had gone to the Maldives!",We had a deluxe ocean view with a nice view.,af,negative,en,negative,en,positive,very disappointing,"after a week of touring around sri lanka for the first part of our honeymoon we were looking forward to spending a week by the sea in a 5 star resort. unfotunately we were very disappointed with this hotel. the good points about the hotel are the large swimming pools and the view of the sea from most parts of the hotel. 
the bad points are numerous:
-during our stay the weather was very windy and it rained heavily. the hotel is not designed to cope  heavy rainfall as it is designed in a very modern, open minimalist way. all the corridors, a bar and the cafe are completely open to the elements. this meant that rain was constantly pouring in and the floors were several centimetres deep in some places. this made the floors very slippy and we found we were unable to get around the hotel much and it made sitting in the front bar and cafe impossible as the bar does not have any front covers to keep the rain out. the staff are constantly sweeping the water away and moving furniture around out of the rain which was very irritating. the overall cleanliness of the hotel is not that great either and the hotel is starting to look rundown. the bathroom in our room had lots of mould in the shower(picture attached), and there was no bath option, you have to pay for a premium top floor room to get a bath! having stayed in many 5 star and 4 star hotels all over europe and asia, i would say this is a 3 star at best, the other 3 star hotels we stayed in during our holiday were in fact much better. 
-the food is boring and pricey by sri lankan standards although you would expect that in a 5 star hotel. we went to the fine dining restaurant one night which was pretty good, although very run-of-the-mill options such as steak and mash. the desserts were interesting but after waiting over half an hour, when they arrived they were poorly executed and my dessert was not even what i ordered. being the only other couple in the restaurant this was certainly not what we expected. the breakfast is also disappointing, the only positive being the traditional sri lankan curries offered. the omelette queue was impressive every morning and that only left under-cooked waffles, anaemic chicken sausages and fatty bacon cooked to order. the rest of the buffet was luke-warm at best. the fresh fruit offered however was fesh and ripe and there was lots of choice.

Ctina,"West Sussex, United Kingdom",Couples,"Sadly, a bit of a disappointment...",11/12/2025,"We stayed at the Heritance Ahungalla towards the end of our tour around Sri Lanka, having stayed at two other Heritance Hotels (Kandalama and Tea Factory).  We were looking forward to a relaxing three days...

Firstly, the positives...We were upgraded to a beautiful suite, which was one of the best rooms we had during our tour.  The room had a comfy bed, a large flat-screen tv (with seating in front), and a huge, luxurious bathroom.  The whole room was kept scrupulously clean thoughout by our friendly ""room boy"".  

Breakfast was the usual buffet (including excellent dosas).  The staff at breakfast were friendly and offered us different teas to the usual.

The hotel has two pools...the residents' pool was generally quiet.  The other pool (in front of the reception area) was busier, and was somewhat blighted by the beach sellers (more on that later!).

So, the negatives...Looking at the hotel's website, they seem to be badging it as a luxury-style resort...hmmm, well sadly, we found it a bit lacking:

The food was rather average compared to the offerings in the other Heritance hotels we 'd stayed at.  Elsewhere we had good quality, creative snacks when we fancied a change to Sri Lankan food (for example excellent club-style sandwiches, items for sharing etc).  Here, there selection was a bit mundane.  We only found out that there was a veggie menu when we had a chance discussion with a staff member...there was no mention of this in the in-room pack, or displayed in the restaurants.  This really does need to be made clearer.  Also, the veggie menu is available 24hrs in the cafe/bar, but apparently isn't routinely available for room service!  We had a couple of frustrating phone calls trying to order from it...we called at 5.15pm and were told to call back after 6pm..and when we did call, were told to call back again at 7pm!  

We also ate in the cafe/bar, but one order was not as described on the menu (chop suey with pad thai turned out to be sloppy veggies with a small pile of rice).  The rice with veggie curries were delicious, but there were so many flies it put us off (we appreciate that its not unusual to get flies when effectively dining alfresco, but it was a bit much when I turned to spoon some more curries and half had flies in them (surely a cover would have been sensible?)).

Although the resident’s pool was generally quiet, we were disturbed a couple of times by people trying to sell stuff (the resident palm reader and vendor of wooden items which could be purchased from the other pool).  

And finally, our biggest complaint....the beach is effectively a no-go area due to sellers of sarongs, tours and local hoteliers trying to pursuade residents to visit their hotel for dinner and spa treatments etc.  These people were relentless and aggressive in their tactics, following tourists along the beach, and would not take no for an answer if you made the mistake of venturing onto their patch (ie. step off of the grass onto the sand).  We even witnessed them shouting to people sunbathing around the pool.

- great view of the ocean (sea view avaiable with Premium rooms0
- speacious clean rooms
- good size pools (note there are two pools, and one is mostly only offered to foreigners)
- good spread for buffet (but its almost the same everyday for bfast)

Cons
- teriible reception/front desk service; had a don't care attitude and were often rude
- had electrical problems in the room when the fan was turned on but even after informing the reception twice (on two seperate days), they did nothing about it..did not even apologise or offer to change the room
- requested king/queen bed but were only given twin mattresses
- no bath tubs, this is only available in luxury rooms
- Not much choice for in-room dining
- Don't visit during the weekends; the hotel allows far too many groups to have the spend the day on the weekends (allowing one or two groups is fine but there should be a limit so that the pools are not over crowded);

robert f,"London, United Kingdom",Couples,BEWARE THE BEACH GANGS,7/12/2025,"This is a First Class hotel and deserves its rating 

It is excellent in every way but has one huge problem ! 

The huge problem is the Beach Gangs who patrol the hotel frontage to the beach 

These gangs are totally illegal but the hotel allows them to harass and harangue the guests 

These gangs do not accept a polite refusal

They are well organised and surround each guest and are extremely agressive 

They do not give up and basically they hound and bully each poor guest until in desperation a guest agrees to purchase goods from them 

The goods they sell are unlicensed excursions, unlicensed trips , unlicensed massage parlours and meals in local Hostelries which would be closed down by Health and Safety without even entering inside the premises 

I think that this is an appalling situation as it is blatantly obvious that Sri Lanka is a poor country  and relies heavily on the income from tourists 

I can assure readers of this column that not one rupee from the pockets of the Beach Gangs will be used to benefit the local community or Sri Lanka as a whole 

I would also remind readers that in the event of an accident ( which is very common on the crazy Sri Lanka roads ) that Insurance Companies will not pay one penny if a client was travelling on an illegal or unlicensed tour or trip or taxi ride . 

An unforeseen accident in Sri Lanka can result in enormous medical and hospital and repatriation bills 

I did complain to the Heritance staff about the continued agressive behaviour of the Beach Gangs ( who also shout to the guests reclining in the hotel grounds ) 

The staff advised that they all lived locally and thus did not wish to upset the Beach Gangs for fear of repercussions on themselves and on their families 

In conclusion , I find this an appalling situation whereby the Hotel Management is turning a blind eye to the discomfort and unhappiness of their guests 

I must also admit quite openly that unless there is some form of financial reward being given weekly to the Hotel Management , I can see no earthly reason why the Hotel Management encourages the Beach Gangs to extort money from their guests 

Apart from the above problem , I can confirm that this is an excellent hotel 

I have stayed in most of the decent hotels in Sri Lanka but this is definitely the best in my opinion

The rooms ( bedrooms and suites ) are a good size and immaculately furnished; towels , soaps , water etc are changed twice daily and the Housekeeping service is of a very high standard 

The food is superb and every mealtime offered a new selection of mouth watering delights ; huge prawns and devilled crabs were in such abundance that we eventually declined them as we simply could not eat any more !

There are 2 very large landscaped pools here and both of them were crystal clear and beautifully warm at all times 

There are also many sports and fitness facilities at this hotel and we really enjoyed our daily game of badminton 

This hotel  sits alone  on a massive empty silky sandy beach backed by tall swaying palm trees  ; the beach stretches for miles from one headland to the next

Swimming in the sea is definitely not possible at this time of the year as the sea is very rough with tremendous undercurrents 

However , the pools at the Heritance are so large you can easily  imagine you are swimming in the sea

I should also add that the Ayurveda Spa is a must and is in the most Romantic position imaginable ; their  treatments are excellent and their methods of curing aches and pains are really incredible   

In conclusion , this is an excellent hotel but it will quickly lose its popularity if the Owners do not step in and banish the Beach Gangs","Choose a first or  second floor for an unimpeded Ocean View

At the dining hall, for some odd reason, there were no cloth table napkins and instead, a cheap replacement of paper serviettes. The food served were all so bland and nothing impressive, that's including desserts. I even overheard a couple saying that it was the same for the past few days! 

Breakfast had in store for us, an averagely spicy Sri Lankan food corner which was quite good.

Pools and activity around the pool was enjoyable and the best part of this stay. An interesting underwater Zumba class also took place! 

The rooms were the same as before, thank goodness, but one thing made me stop my praise. The bidet shower was out of order.

(Child stays free in  a double room sharing bed but for the meal, they charge about 30USD). In any case, we were asked to pay extra for the child meal because the price mentioned was the Double room rate. It was a mistake done by booking operator and the Hotel said that if we refuse to pay, the balance will have to be deducted from operator's wage.

In our opinion this hotel needs to be downgraded to four star.  Whilst there was some painting/maintenance work taking place while we were there, the hotel didn’t have that ‘luxurious’ five star feeling about it.   Certainly comparing it to a five star rated hotel we stayed in whilst holidaying in Zanzibar 18 month's ago, it was definitely of a different class/standard.
  
The fruit bowl, dressing gowns and slippers were not in our room when we arrived and there was no mention, when we checked in, of them arriving later.  The cream rug was filthy (we rolled it up and put it under the bed) and that improved the look of the room immediately!  

On the plus side, the staff were extremely friendly and helpful and very responsive to our needs.

On several occasions we only had one bath towel left instead of two which meant having to call  house-keeping.  Although immediately we called the second towel would rapidly appear, this isn't the level of service we would expect from a five star resort.

The restaurant areas were nice and the food was good.  We tended to eat in the coffee shop which also served as a restaurant which did some nice meals, we did eat occasionally in the buffet restaurant.  

The pool area is nice.  The hotel is located on the beach, but most of the time the red flags are flying due to the under currents there.  On most days despite the red flag flying people still went into the sea, if you went with caution you were fine, but there were occasions people got into difficulties and the life guard at the hotel had to come to their rescue.

We enjoyed watching a wedding take place whilst there.  

We also had the experience of seeing one of the resident monitor lizards digging up and eating another monitor lizard’s eggs (13 in all!!!).  

We were lucky enough to see a turtle come ashore and lay her eggs on the beach before going back out to sea – wow what a wonderful experience.

We also visited a turtle hatchery up the road, take a tuk tuk (it’s cheaper than a taxi) and if you want to experience putting baby turtles into the sea you need to go at dusk around 6.00 pm (in Feb).  

Before booking this hotel we were told we could go out of the hotel and that there were lots of eating places in the area, this is not the case.  We were told not to go out of the resort at night, so that was also disappointing.  Sadly there is no ‘all  inclusive’ option here.  

In summary, this is a nice hotel, situated on a lovely beach, not five star luxury, but a nice four star.

Yodoofus,"Perth, Australia",Couples,We just didn't get it...,2/12/2025,"If you are into stuffing your face on buffets and booze, probably a great hotel for you.  If you are looking for quality food and culture, or even 5 star service probably not for you.

Outwardly the hotel looks great, they rely on the great infinity pool for the wow factor but scratch the surface and there is not much else a pontins holiday park wouldn't provide.  Probably why there are limited photo's on the website apart from the pool.

We paid extra for a luxury room, which was very nice but cost enough to justify.  The room along with the friendly staff were the best parts of the holiday.

Breakfast was average, dark, dingy, smokey (cooking smoke) buffet room.  Nice cooked options, and hoppers.  Waffles were very nice, but coffee served was just terrible.

Green pool was OK, but cloudy water.  Good green pool service

Nice beach, but not worth visiting due to the constant hassle.  People have to earn a living but it gets a bit draining to be friendly, only to be hassled to buy something every time you want to walk along the beach.

Grotty and hot gym, with old equipment.

Miles away from anywhere, so unless you want a 1/2hr tuk tuk ride to Bentota (which is fine and plenty of offers outside the gate) you are stuck with hotel options.  The best food we found was in the mustard cafe, lovely curries.  Everything else was overpriced euro buffet.

Final nail in the coffin was check-out, no service at the nice reception desk, you go round to the back office, smelly little room where you que up to pay your $$$$ bill while the cashier argues and discusses other bills with clients and colleagues.  Then the taxi you ordered with the concierge isn't booked after all, they just look at each other and call over the 20 year old smelly wagon.  We refused to get in, and they got an equally smelly but slightly newer car for the 9000 rupee ride to Colombo.  Smelly is a reoccurring issue here.

But the room was not ready at check- in and we had to wait quite awhile. We were given large half glasses (yeah half!) of a local fresh juice but realised later that other check in guests were given moist towels as well. Finally, we were taken into a 2 roomed suite that had been furnished for only two persons. We had to look for a room boy to tip him to bring in a third bed, third set of towels etc.etc. Our so-called luxury room was far from that - the 'fridge didn't work, the TV was badly tuned, the safety deposit locker malfunctioned, one bedside light didn't work.. Due to the malfunctioning fridge we were not even able to break a bottle of bubbly.. (now who likes warm champagne) - (BTW check the spelling of 'champagne' in the GM's letter of welcome - here my sex was wrong - I was titled as 'Mr'

We had tipped the check-in steward - a name like Achila - do avoid this scoundrel at all costs! - generously to get us a table for the gala dinner, but he was nowhere to be seen. We looked into the area four times, to ensure that we had a table, but nothing had been set up for us. Finally, we were told to come down for dinner and that we would then get our table. No table when we arrived for dinner. We were then told to sit at another table. Five minutes later the same steward - named Mudalige - said he was sorry but the table had been booked by somebody else!!- I refused to get up! Our table had no lamp of decor etc like the other tables and after telling just about every waiter passing by, we got some of these things over 1 1/2 hours later!! 

The next day at breakfast, after standing in line for awhile, I requested a warm item from a  serving chef, I was told by him that he had to serve over 50 guests at that time (so what?!). 

Finally, the time to depart arrived, and we breathed a sign of relief. We were all women but even the final receipt was titled 'Me & Mrs"". When I got to my car in the hotel car park I found parts of it strewn about - it had been damaged by a tour operator who had claimed that I had been blocking him! Now this was a clearly designated hotel parking space which should have been so designed not to inconvenienced other vehicles. The hotel couldn't even inform the person to remove my vehicle (they didn't even know the name or company of the vandal) because it keeps no records of guest vehicles - rather a security threat in a country just recovering from civil strife, methinks.... 

Having said this, the general manager and front office manager were extremely nice and tried to compensate for our traumatic experience by even offering us an extra night on the house, but we had to get back to our families on new years day - so we were given a discount on the room rate, cakes and chocolates to forget our troubles..

WylamPhil,"Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom",Couples,Simply Brilliant - Again!,12/11/2025,"Our first stay here in 2009 was on the very strong recommendation of Sri Lankan friends and we vowed to return sooner  rather than later. Neither my wife or I recognised some of the negative comments on this site prior to booking our latest trip in December 2011 but we had some concerns.

Those concerns were totally unfounded.

From the moment we were met with  refreshing cinnamon tea until the redoubtable Dudley packed our cases in the car at the end of our stay, it was total relaxation. 

The attitude of the staff is a delight and may explain some of the complaints - they have a wonderful ability of being remarkably attentive whilst appearing to be laid back which may be misinterpreted as appearing not to care.Nothing could be further from the truth. Some of the younger staff members are still extremely keen and their enthusiasm, whilst appreciated, intrudes slightly into the relaxed ambiance. They could do well to learn from Jacob. If you have the good fortune to have your table served by this gentleman you will understand the point I'm attempting to make. He is like a swan gliding serenely on the surface whilst away from view he is paddling like hell to ensure that you enjoy every minute in his care.

Our room was excellent - the only criticism we could make was the that the Venetian blind in the bathroom was past its best.... this is really struggling to be negative. 

I can't believe that someone on here had complained about the food - how absurd! Not only was the buffet absolutely first class but the puddings were out of this world. A real trip down memory lane for persons of a certain age! Unsurprisingly, the dessert table won first prize in the hotel industry awards. Please don't take my word for this - our visit coincided with that of an annual trip of French gamblers(???!) to the hotel. They attacked each meal with that Gallic gusto which is unique, (complete with napkins tied around their necks!) - if it hadn't been up to standard I'm sure that it would have been the kitchen staff at risk rather than the food! When these lovely characters found that my wife was multi-lingual they hijacked her on a regular basis to tell the hotel chefs of their appreciation.

Another negative comment I had read was regarding the beach folk. Yes, at times they can be boorish but they are trying to make a living. If you inform them that you are definitely not interested in purchasing anything today they will leave you alone. You are, however, missing the opportunity to chat to some fascinating people with experiences completely different to your own who would really appreciate the opportunity of honing their language skills on you - this is especially true of the clothing ladies. If all else fails the magic word to use is 'yanda!' whose interpretation is, I believe as rude as it is effective!

We would like to thank the management team of  Rifan (General Manager), Tilleth (Food and Beverage Manager) and above all the professional and gregarious Sampath (Assistant Manager) for a superb stay. You have staff and a hotel to be very proud of.","Rather than asking for a balcony, we asked for a ground floor room which opened out directly onto the residents only &#39;Green Pool.&#39;",en,positive,en,negative,en,negative,simply brilliant - again!,"our first stay here in 2009 was on the very strong recommendation of sri lankan friends and we vowed to return sooner  rather than later. neither my wife or i recognised some of the negative comments on this site prior to booking our latest trip in december 2011 but we had some concerns.

those concerns were totally unfounded.

from the moment we were met with  refreshing cinnamon tea until the redoubtable dudley packed our cases in the car at the end of our stay, it was total relaxation. 

the attitude of the staff is a delight and may explain some of the complaints - they have a wonderful ability of being remarkably attentive whilst appearing to be laid back which may be misinterpreted as appearing not to care.nothing could be further from the truth. some of the younger staff members are still extremely keen and their enthusiasm, whilst appreciated, intrudes slightly into the relaxed ambiance. they could do well to learn from jacob. if you have the good fortune to have your table served by this gentleman you will understand the point i'm attempting to make. he is like a swan gliding serenely on the surface whilst away from view he is paddling like hell to ensure that you enjoy every minute in his care.

our room was excellent - the only criticism we could make was the that the venetian blind in the bathroom was past its best.... this is really struggling to be negative. 

i can't believe that someone on here had complained about the food - how absurd! not only was the buffet absolutely first class but the puddings were out of this world. a real trip down memory lane for persons of a certain age! unsurprisingly, the dessert table won first prize in the hotel industry awards. please don't take my word for this - our visit coincided with that of an annual trip of french gamblers(???!) to the hotel. they attacked each meal with that gallic gusto which is unique, (complete with napkins tied around their necks!) - if it hadn't been up to standard i'm sure that it would have been the kitchen staff at risk rather than the food! when these lovely characters found that my wife was multi-lingual they hijacked her on a regular basis to tell the hotel chefs of their appreciation.

Dacoja,,Family,Not a 5 Star hotel - no entertainment - poor restaurant choices.,9/10/2025,"Totally disappointed with this hotel.  The entrance foyer was cold and clinical which was about the standard for the whole hotel.  There was no entertainment until we complained and then there was some water aerobics and that was about it.  There was a games room that was filthy and had about 2 board games in it, the snooker table you had to pay for, the pool table you had to pay for.  There were 3 restaurants but you only really had a choice of 2 as the Upper Dining Room was ridiculously expensive, we did not actually see anyone eat there in our 2 week stayy!  There was a cafe with a very limited menu or the main restaurant that was a buffet.  The food in these 2 restaurants was okay but the service was terrible.  Breakfast was served in the buffet restaurant and the tables were always mucky, you had to constantly ask for tea or coffee and sometimes wait for up to 20 minutes for it to arrive.
On a Saturday the hotel opens the main infinity pool area up to local customers, this meant that we had to use the other pool which upset the children.  The main pool was rammed with people playing games and being extremely loud making it much to dangerous for children to swim and also a very uncomfortable environment.  Whilst at the other pool we ordered lunch and were told we would have a long wait as they were so busy as it was a Saturday!!  Whilst we were at the hotel the Sri Lankan and Indian national crickets teams were there, the hotels focus was totally on them and important members of staff were moved to run the catering at the matches - this was very much noticed by guests at the hotel as the service in the restaurants became ridiculously slow and many mistakes were made.
The people of Sri Lanka our lovely and very kind and helpful and we felt totally safe when we wandered along the beach way from the hotel.
We met a fantastic driver who was wonderful in showing us around and really looked after our children, he is a recommended driver at the hotel and his name is Erish.  We had some absolutely wonderful experiences when he took us out as he really worked to make sure we saw everything and enjoyed ourselves, he is also a good driver and very safe which is quite a rarity in Sri Lanka!!!",,en,negative,en,negative,unknown,unknown,not a 5 star hotel - no entertainment - poor restaurant choices.,"totally disappointed with this hotel.  the entrance foyer was cold and clinical which was about the standard for the whole hotel.  there was no entertainment until we complained and then there was some water aerobics and that was about it.  there was a games room that was filthy and had about 2 board games in it, the snooker table you had to pay for, the pool table you had to pay for.  there were 3 restaurants but you only really had a choice of 2 as the upper dining room was ridiculously expensive, we did not actually see anyone eat there in our 2 week stayy!  there was a cafe with a very limited menu or the main restaurant that was a buffet.  the food in these 2 restaurants was okay but the service was terrible.  breakfast was served in the buffet restaurant and the tables were always mucky, you had to constantly ask for tea or coffee and sometimes wait for up to 20 minutes for it to arrive.

Clarendoug,,Family,Ok but could be so much better,8/10/2025,"Well having had a long flight and a long drive I may have been slightly over tired but my first impressions of the hotel and the room was disappointment. It does come down to taste but I found the hotel is characterless. Our room was good but without the two extra beds for the children which was irritating as my husband had emailed the hotel directly confirming them but they were set up quickly and our request for table lamps in the lounge rather than overhead lighting met as quickly. 

The children loved the pools and I absolutely hated breakfast!
It was enough to bring tears to your eyes the oppressive dining room the scrum around the breakfast bar seemingly at all times, the awful service.
I had so many variations on getting a cup of earl grey they were green tea, warm milk, teabags and nothing else including water or a cup,  they ran out of tea bags I supplied my own and then tea arriving 30 minutes later when you're just about to leave. In the land of bountiful fruit why are 3 out of 5 breakfast juices made from concentrate or nearer to cordial? Can they not default to 4 place servings, then if 2 come to breakfast  they are happy and if 4 come down they are instantly satisified a win win rather than waiting 10 minutes for cutlery for 2 of the party. Can they not allocate a server to families staying longer than 3 nights thus establishing a rapport.

Saying that the service elsewhere was fine. The food ranged from adequate to good.
Amal's in Bentota was excellent for sea food and Refresh in Hikkaduwa(45 mins) had an enormous choice and was very good.

The location was ok , Galle was an hour drive Bentota about 30 minutes. We did take some trips to Udawlawe 4 hours each way and Sinharaja 3 hours each way.

As mentioned in previous reviews the beach is effectively out of bounds if you do not wish to be pursued by the local tour guides and hawkers.

It could be a great hotel with adequate staff training to instill a sense of ownership and pride, a rethink of the decor, a complete overhaul of the main dining room practices, some investment in soft furnishings.

Szinvene,"London, United Kingdom",Couples,The honeymoon from hell,7/10/2025,"Heritance Ahungalla is not by any standards a 4,5 star hotel. We have chosen it for our honeymoon trip as pictures seen on the website looked amazing and we also read many good reviews. However, our stay there turn out to be a great dissapointment and we won't be going back. 
To list just few problems you may encounter there : it is impossible to go for a walk on the beach as you are constantly pestered by locals who do not take no for an answer; cockroaches can be found not only on hotel corridors but also inside the rooms; the cutlery served at tables has leftovers of food stuck to it; the bed linen in the rooms as well as the curtains are stained and often with holes; the hotel provides hardly any toiletries and if so, they are stuck on the bottom of a ceramic bottles in a very small quantitiy; there are constant problems with electricity and it can go off for over 30mins at time.  
As for the service it is probably one of the most tiresom and annoying problems of all, as there is no communication between the team members serving meals in the restaurant, you need to ask several times for a pot of coffee or a bottle of water, provided that you will be understood by the waiter on the first occassion. If so, the requested drink may not be delivered at all, while few other team memers will approach with exactly the same question about your choice of drink but it will take ages for someone to actually deliver it to the table. The tips are expected while the service quality or rather its lack, does not jusitfy it at all. The most imposing are often the housekeeping supervisors (not the regular housekeepers- they work very hard and hardly ever strike a conversation with a guest), who can follow you down the corridor repeating few times that they are entirely responsible for cleaning your room....all obviously to be tipped.  In case of any problems with the room calling reception is normally a waste of time, as you have to call back several times before someone turns up to deal with the problem.  The hotel is full of damp and looks as if its times of glory have long gone.

LampsRoaming,"London, United Kingdom",Family,"Could be good, but service is so patchy.",7/10/2025,"Have just returned from 2 weeks at the Heritance and overall it was a disappointing experience, primarily because the service was so mixed, ranging from good, to indifferent, to frankly poor.
My wife and I travelled with our 13 year old son, and we stayed in 2 adjacent luxury rooms, which were slightly tired, but extremely spacious, and thoroughly cleaned every day. A word of warning to anyone travelling with younger children, we had made 3 advance requests via our Tour Operator ""Kuoni"", for inter connecting rooms. We received no reply, and were only advised on arrival that the hotel has no interconnecting rooms.
The 2 hotel pools are large and well maintained, one offering some limited organised activities and the other  residents'  pool offering a quieter option.
The hotel and grounds are  spacious, and even though  the hotel was fully occupied for part of our stay, it never felt over crowded.
We had opted for bed and breakfast, so didn't experience the buffet, all inclusive option. However a few of our fellow guests did and commented that the food was good quality, but repetitive if staying for 2 weeks. We mainly ate in the Coffee Shop restaurant where the food was good, and given a supposed 5 star hotel, we thought the prices were reasonable.
Dining out options in the village of Ahungalla are non existent. If you walk out of the hotel complex, you are quickly surrounded by several locals, offering TukTuk rides, boat safaris, and numerous trips. They are persistent but never threatening, and several firm "" no thank you""  will usually see them retreat. The village does have a pharmacy and a bank. If you are cashing travellers cheques, it is worth the 5 minute stroll to the bank as it offers a significantly better exchange  rate than the hotel.
For dining out you need to get a taxi or a TukTuk to Bentota or else to HIkkaduwa.
Bentota has several hotels and is 20 minutes in a taxi or about 25/30 minutes in a TukTuk.
The drivers will wait for you and negotiate a return trip price. A hotel taxi was about £20 for a return trip, with the tuktuks costing about half of that.
The best restaurant we found was the Golden Grill, good for curries and seafood. Dinner for    3 people with beer and soft drinks was typically £30 to £40 in total.

Main frustration came with the inconsistent service in the hotel. 
At breakfast, there was a great range of food, and all well presented, and plenty of staff on hand. Unfortunately it wasn't unusual for 3 different waiters to approach you to ask whether we wanted tea or coffee, but then none of them would get round to serving it.
The pool attendants are helpful but want tipping continually and the room cleaners changed several times and all made subtle overtures for tips.
Reception staff were always smiling, but poorly trained and inefficient with  simple requests having to be made several times before anything got done.
After the first week we found a great guy working reception and just made sure we dealt with him.
Some lovely staff serving drinks around the pool, always friendly and helpful.
Wandering onto the beach is spoilt because the locals will lie in wait and then follow you round trying to sell you gouges or trips. They will ask your name and if you give it, they will stand at the edge of the hotel property calling to you while you try  and relax on your sun 
bed. Again they aren't threatening in any way, just persistent and something of a pain. Just keep  saying ""no thank you"" and they will eventually give up !
Overall, the Heritance is nice but dated hotel, but represents pretty reasonable value for what it is. The location is isolated but the grounds and pools are good, and the rooms are fine. It has the potential to offer a relaxed, get away from it all style resort, IF the management could get their act together and get the service to a consistently efficient level.",,en,negative,en,negative,unknown,unknown,"could be good, but service is so patchy.","have just returned from 2 weeks at the heritance and overall it was a disappointing experience, primarily because the service was so mixed, ranging from good, to indifferent, to frankly poor.

SheenMumbai,,Business,Ahun....I mean aha ...I will return to infinity.,6/10/2025,"Heritance Ahungalla is a place that will immediately bring your pulse rate down. A great atmosphere to relax, soak in the sun and enjoy a huge spread of Sri Lankan food.  Geoffery Bawa's characteristic infinity pool, the sound of the crashing waves and the setting sun are guaranteed to put you in a mellow mood.

We travelled as a family of 2 children 2 and 4 yrs plus granparents. We had an excellent time and would not hesitate to recommend this hotel. The architexture is stunning with a very calm atmosphere and a wonderful infinity pool that blends into the beach. The pictures don't do it justice.

We stayed in their 2 interconnecting rooms 301 and 302 which were spacious and had excellent see views. They made them up as a king size and 2 singles which suited us great. You could hear the entertainment but it finished at a reasonable time. The ""animators"" were really helpful, building sandcastles and flying kites with the children. We all enjoyed the daily aqua aerobics. 

One of the best things about the hotel and sri lanka is the poeple. The were very friendly and genuine and made our stay one to remember. The service was very occasionally slightly chaotic in a nice sri lankan way, but everyone was very helpful. The food was the best that we tasted anywhere on our trip in the hotel. Breakfast is excellent and the food in the coffee shop was v tasty. The chinese and BBQ buffets were worth it and we weren't charged for the children. Drink prices were reasonable (we were charged twice as much in the hotel on our trip to Kandy).

We did some trips around the area with Bertie from the sunshine resturant at the end of the beach. I would definitely recommend the river safari as not to be missed.

Emma_msk,"Moscow, Russia",Couples,Complete and utter disappointment!!,1/10/2025,"I checked this hotel at tripadvisor before booking it and expected it to be nice and relaxing at the very least, however, the whole stay (we stayed there for 3 weeks) was a complete and utter disappointment! Looks like Heritance has changed a lot lately and it's surely not a 5* hotel anymore. 

After an almost 20-hour trip to the hotel, my only wish was to have a shower and lie down, however, we had to spent almost half an hour answering stupid questions about our anniversary, etc. 
The staff was too talkative and tactless even, several times we had spend almost the entire lunch in their company and nothing could possibly make them leave. 

All the advantages of this place faded away in comparison with its negative sides.
Quite nice design of the room couldn't make up for holes in bedsheets, dirty curtains, breaking conditioning, old towels and other things. 
The food was really fabulous, however, when the evening food was under a set menu, almost all guest opted for the a la carte restaurant as the set menu was really poor and the meal lasted forever.
The atmosphere was quite relaxing most of the time, however, there was no chance to even enter the pool as soon as weekend came and the hotel was fully packed with locals. 

Some things kept on spoiling our stay on every day basis. The beach area was constantly full of locals, who were trying to sell you a trip or whatever you wanted or didn't wanted. Even by the pool your every single movement was followed by their attempts to draw your attention. If you managed to escape and reach the ocean, several guys were waiting for you to come back.

TwaCorbies,,Couples,"Right hotel, wrong place",1/10/2025,"We have just returned from a three week stay at the Heritance Hotel. 
Hotel was basically good, everything worked, including the staff who, if anything, could be overly attentive. Rooms were stylish, had plenty of storage space and were serviced twice daily. Balconies had views across the beach to the setting sun. Some guests complained of minor faults, e.g. our fridge broke down but was repaired the same morning. Food was a good as could be expected with Buffet Service and we were never bored, although the dining room could be noisy. 

The hotel is proud of its swimming pools and rightly so. Attentive pool boys and life guards ensure there is not the usual scramble for beds and towels. We actually preferred the second (residents) pool to that shown in all the literature. The beach was regularly cleaned and patrolled. Constant slight surf, no problems for even moderate swimmers but small children should be supervised.

The hotel’s main drawback is its isolation. Locally, there is simply nowhere to go and little to do. Ahungalla village consists of some 70 yards of dilapidated shacks selling local produce and a few basics at blatantly ’tourist’ and local prices. There is also a passable bakery, a pharmacy, a bank with no ATM and a railway station at which few trains actually stop. There are two bus services and two qualities of bus i.e. Air Conditioned and Local. It is difficult to ascertain what is a public bus, as opposed to touring or private hire and even more difficult to have them stop. Heritance guests are not expected to want to walk anywhere, let alone get on a bus.

The weather was good. It rained frequently but usually in late evening and accompanied by spectacular lightning. Mosquitoes are in evidence and, despite a wall plug device and sprays we were both bitten frequently. 

Guests attempting to leave the hotel by the main entrance have to run the gauntlet of a persistent group of motorised tricycle (Tuk Tuk) taxi drivers who will resort to any device to have you hire them. In addition, the driver will insist on waiting for you and interfere with your activities. Their constant attentions became oppressive, more so than had we stayed in Bentota or Hikkaduwa where there are more hotels, more activities, thereby more tourists to go around.

Beach vendors were a nuisance but were not permitted onto hotel premises. A fellow female guests was accosted on the beach some 200yds from the hotel and robbed of her hat and wrap. This was however an isolated incident and we found the local people welcoming and keen to promote their countries new found stability.

Expeditions were possible, 400 yards North along the beach to a fish restaurant shack is worthwhile. I ordered Lobster and drank a local beer whist two young men went out with snorkels and a net to retrieve one. 

800yds south along the Galle road, on the left, is the Lucky Lanka Spice Garden and Ayurvidic Centre run by a charming young man. Full body massage for £10 and a large selection of herbal potions to buy at ‘local’ prices. 

Other worthwhile excursions are a tour of lagoon at Balapitaya (or Bentota) with a visit to one island to see cinnamon being hand rolled by a wonderful old man and his elfin grand daughter.

A morning’s snorkelling by Some at International Dive Centre, located at Coral Sands Hotel in Hikkaduwa is good value where there is an excellent parade of fish, including Octopus. The coral was badly damaged in the Tsunami but hopefully showing signs of a return.

If Temples and/or elephants are your thing, then there are further trips afield, e.g Kandy, Yala National Park and Burwela Bird Sanctuary. However, from Ahungalla, both entail an expenditure of over £110 pp, an overnight stay and between 5-7 hours in a minivan, each way. 

In summary; great hotel but we chose the wrong location for the type of holiday we enjoy. To get the best from Sri Lanka we would recommend dividing time between the Highlands, forests, wildlife parks and beaches. If however, you want a hotel based beach stay for a few days, you would be pushed to find better.

The pools were fantastic...clean, great suze and we had one of the two at leat to ourselves on many occasions..it was great!! Below are some further comments:

Room - was brilliant. It was a great size, really nicely furnished, clean with a great bathroom. Great views to pool and ocean. Cleaned daily.

Food - amazing! we were on  ahalf board basis and te food was superb. Great choice, different them every day, fresh, beautiful curries!

Service - amazing. The staff were so attentive it was incredible. They were polite and friendly all the time. They alwas say hello and and make a real rapport with you throughout the time we were there.

Beach - lovely but you do get hounded a bit by the touts when you walk on it. Just ignore them if you want them to leave you alone. Theyre firendly though. The sea is a bit rough so you cant really swim in it.

Touts - if you want to get a taxi just ask one of the touts for a tuk tuk Its so much cheaper than the hotel taxis. We had the same driver for the whole 10 days and he was great. He took us to lots of places cheaply and was a safe driver. Dont be scared to use one..youll probably be a bit nervous the first time you get in one but then you can get their number and as soon as you want to go somewheer give them a call and theyll come and pick you up.

Overall..couldnt fault our time at the heritance in any way. Ive read some of the negative reviews on this site and cant really understand what theyre on about. One said this hotel was dated which is complete rubbish!

Tim_Latif,,Family,Nice Hotel - but not a 5-Star,9/9/2025,"We stayed beginning of August for 3 nights in the Junior Suite in Heritance Ahungalla.

In general, the rooms are clean, the swimming pool is nice, especially for kids and also the beach is great.

Unfortunately, like most 5-star hotels in Sri Lanka, also this one lacked essential things like a proper finishing in the room (the bathroom was a desaster, I cut myself several times at the glass door there), a very small TV only etc.

The food was good quality, thoug a little expensive, but because we liked it we only ate at the hotel. The breakfast had a wide selection, and there was a big variety at the dinner buffetts, for example ""seafood grill night"" etc.

The service was very poor, anything you wanted to do or to get took ages and did not work properly. On one saturday night there was a wedding with extremely loud music next to the second pool (where all the suites are localed; it was like a disco), and with still going on after 11 o´clock and the kids not being able to sleep I complained several times without success. It went on until 3 in the morning, which literally destroyed our next day and is something no 5-star hotel should accept. Many guests complained, but the management rather preferred to cash in the money for the ceremony instead of satisfiying their guests.

Nevertheless we had altogether a good time, the animateurs at the hotel were dedicated and we had a lot of fun with waterpolo and beach volleyball.

One last note: as generally in Sri Lankan 5 star hotels, they overprice taxis etc. by 300 to 400%.

BahrainElephant,,Couples,"Beautiful beach, Seedy, Overpriced, with friendly but incompetant staff",9/9/2025,"The stunning view beach is the only positive memory that we have from our stay.  Otherwise the hotel is dated, poorly managed, and many unmaintained facilities. Air conditioning, ceiling fan in our room did not work.  The door locks in our room to the bathroom and balcony were broken.  Considering that balconies from other rooms are essentially interconnected, there was little or no security from the balcony side of our room.  

The main restaurant buffet is expensive and of poor cafeteria style food. Very little flair to the food, designed to please those who did not really want to leave home.

Entertainment in the lobby at night is essentially Karaoke musicians mouthing CD music.  The hotel was built in the 1960s and it seems nothing was done to improve or redecorate the place since it's initial opening.  It is a nice visit back to a mid 1960's contemporary architecture that has a seedy ambiance.

The staff is friendly and helpful as long as it does not involve complicated activities such as room maintenance, directions to anywhere, or being served coffee in the restaurants.

the main restaurant buffet is expensive and of poor cafeteria style food. very little flair to the food, designed to please those who did not really want to leave home.

entertainment in the lobby at night is essentially karaoke musicians mouthing cd music.  the hotel was built in the 1960s and it seems nothing was done to improve or redecorate the place since it's initial opening.  it is a nice visit back to a mid 1960's contemporary architecture that has a seedy ambiance.

the staff is friendly and helpful as long as it does not involve complicated activities such as room maintenance, directions to anywhere, or being served coffee in the restaurants.

Natalie S,,Couples,Didn't live up to the reviews,9/9/2025,"We booked this hotel for the second part of our holiday by the coast. We were swayed to book this hotel due to the raging reviews on Trip Advisor. Unfortunately it didn’t quite live up to our expectations, especially after leaving the Cinnamon Lodge in Habarana which was advertised to be a lower rating hotel.
Our opinions do differ from those on here. The hotel is well known for the architect and so we expected something quite special, as it was also a ‘5’ star resort. On arrival the Loby is attractive as you can see through to a lush swimming pool right onto the sea. The swimming pools were the best bit of this hotel. They are lovely.
However, we did find the hotel lacked character and that holiday feel. The architecture was a bit cold and bleak, very concrete, modern and minimalist. Somewhat like a business Hilton hotel which is just not we want on a holiday. The plants around the hotel seemed tired and a bit dead, just outside our room we overlooked a moulding wall where there used to be vegetation climbing up it. The hotel was all very open which was good for a natural breeze, but as soon as the monsoons came this caused a death trap of slippery hallways bars, seat cushions etc.
The hotel rooms were nice, again modern but of good quality. The whole place lacked good lighting though. There was also the natural bare plastered look in the hotel bathrooms etc. Not our taste but might appeal to some. I personally like a bright lick of paint or something it bit more luxurious.
The hotel did have good facilities if you wanted tennis, ping pong, badminton, spa’s etc. However going onto the beach was slightly annoying due to the persistent locals selling on the beach who would sit on the beach facing the hotel shouting at you to come and look as they will “give you good price”. This is a little off putting but I understand it’s just the way there. We never managed to go onto the beach without having to say no thanks to several different people.
The restaurants and entertainment were the biggest disappointment. The food was always nice (wine expensive) but the restaurants lacked atmosphere. The main restaurant had set menus for most of our stay and these were quite pricey. The buffets in that restaurant were a bit better as at least you got more choice. But the restaurant is dark and dreary. No ambience. The a la carte “Cafe”? did have nice food but a bit limited on choice. You also don’t expect to have your a la carte meal in a cafe which lacked again any sort of luxury and really had the ambience slightly above that of a McDonalds. (I am being slightly harsh).
The entertainment at the hotel was pretty poor. Sometimes there was a band singing the same songs every night.  A cocktail promotion (doesn’t mean it’s a price promotion) with live demonstration. Or simply someone plays an instrument. It was very quiet during our stay so maybe they do more in the main season.
We actually spent many of our nights at the Taj hotel in Bentota after this was recommended to us by fellow guests in the same boat as us.  I suggest you go there just to get a comparison of what a 5 star hotel should really be like. We had a Chinese in the restaurant there and it was lovely. There buffet meals also had a great deal more ambience. Just grab a tuk tuk to get there. The Refresh restaurant 20 mins away in Hikkaduwa was also lovely. I recommend you stay in Bentota though if you want choice and to be able to walk out the hotel to more restuarants. There is nothing near the Heritance.
Having said all that, if you want a quiet, clean relaxing hotel to just unwind sit by the pool and have early nights then it’s a great option. If you are lucky you will see some black monkeys around the hotel. We did get this hotel at a good price so we can’t complain I just believe the ratings on here are misleading.

ta_wigedy,,Couples,Not The Best,7/9/2025,"We travelled to this hotel with Kuoni travel under the idea that it was a 5* luxury hotel. 

This hotel had all the potential of a good 4* hotel. The beech was amazing the staff were amazing, however there always seemed to be something missing and not quality about the hotel. We stayed at this hotel for 7 nights having travelled around the island for 4-5 days. The poolside service was very good with staff being extremely friendly and chatty. The animator was also a healthy addition to the hotel encouraging water polo and other activates throughout the day. The pool bar offered a nice little lunchtime snack menu however every meal was with French fries and wasn’t the best quality. We recommend sprite as it was half the price of coke or diet coke. The sprite was around 70p and coke was £1.50 for a can. There was also a service charge on each bill so there was no need for tipping and carrying cash as it could all be  charged to the room

The evening food in the main restaurant under a set menu was very average and was trying to be to clever for its own good. Not much variety if you were a fussy eater and didn’t like fish. The al a carte restaurant (or coffee shop) offered a welcome opportunity to get a square meal. This was available with a 10% discount to half and full board customers. when the hotel got busy at the weekend however the restaurant came alive with a huge Mexican and bbq buffet on the Friday and Saturday nights. The breakfasts were also very good with every possible breakfast such as omelettes and waffles. 

However, when the weekend did arrive the hotel filled with hundreds of locals. This wasnt a problem until the quiet pool became a holiday at butlans with kids screaming and weeing into the pool. The locals were then extremely rude to the friendly staff making the stay extremely uncomfortable as you had to witness this behaviour. The staff were being shouted at and fingers clicked at with no manners. It was clear that the other guests felt the same through conversations in the lobby. The evening buffet at the weekend although it had good food resembled a school canteen. At 9 oclock families were bringing there young screaming children to dinner. Those children who were not dead on there feet at this time were runing around bumping in to the staff and other guests. This un civilised behaviour caused some couples to leave in disgust.  

The room was very good although we were continually being pested by staff asking if the room was ok. Also the wiring of the room was questionable with switches for different lights being in the wrong place. 

The beech was a no go area also as you were trying to have a romantic walk along the beech and were surrounded by peopel trying to sell you trips and clothing. Even when you were trying to sun bathe there was a constant noise coming from the beech of people trying to grab your attention.

Ridgesas,,Family,Great Property - Poor General Manager,4/9/2025,"We visited Heritence Ahungalle for 2 nights in mid-April 2009.  This was our second trip to the property having visited 5 years ago on our last trip to SL.

Booked directly through the hotel website after comparing other similar properties such as Taj Exotica Bentota, The Fortress, Galle Fort Hotel and Eden Resort.  Chose the Heritence given we had a wonderful stay 5 years ago.  I wrote to the hotel inquiring about rates and was promised a free upgrade to a luxury room given that I was a returning guest.  The hotel also stated that the property has been completely refurbished hence the drastic increase in price.

When I got to the Heritence, I was told I would be given a deluxe room (the most basic room).  I advised that I was promised a free upgrade to which I was told that they cannot honour this promise.  They then advised that I could have an upgrade to a luxury room for an additional cost of Rs. 10,000 (US$86) per night.   Given the higher cost I declined the upgrade and was quite disappointed.

I had also requested a cot for my infant son when the booking was made.  When I got to the hotel I was told that all the cots were in use.  I complained to the General Manager who promised to look into it and get back to me, which he never did.

We could not notice the refurbishments made to the property.  The room we had looked very similar to the room we had five years ago as did the common areas.  

The property itself is beautifully maintained and is set on a stunning section of beach in SL.  The main infinity pool and lobby area are very beautiful.  The food is exceptional with a wide variety of choice all of which are of a very high level of quality.

Samthediver,"London, United Kingdom",,Overpriced and definately not luxury,1/9/2025,"I couldn't agree more with the comments below.  We stayed there from 26th December until after New Year.  Had we been able to get a refund we would have moved out on day 1!

Firstly, despite what their website says, all rooms do NOT have a sea view.  We were given a room overlooking the tennis courts.  After a huge discussion, they said that we could move to a lower category room - where a seaview was availabile - BUT they wouldn't refund us the £450 difference.  After I pointed out that they were falsely advertising, the local agent out there agreed to pay for us to upgrade us to a luxury suite -  however, the hotel really should have picked up this cost as their website was giving incorrect information!

The suite was ok - but not worth the money they charge.  Again, their website states luxury goods and free sparkling wine, fruit etc.  None of those things materialised!  The shower gel was provided in glass bottles which took forever to let the gel out.  There was no conditioner, no bubble bath and the cotton buds were only supplied on the first day - all basic things for a 5 star hotel!

The lighting is also totally illogical as the person states below.  

It's certainly not a luxury 5 star property.  There's water aerobics in the pool every day - with loud techno music blaring out of the speakers.  They had Karaoke in one bar and a very naff electronic keyboard player belting out songs like ""lady in red"" in the other.  Not exclusive property that it claims to be!

The sun loungers had dirty cushions - which didn't even cover the whole of the lounger - and there weren't enough for the number of guests.  

You were also shouted at by the hawkers from the beach - which really shouldn't happen at this type of property (I've stayed at lots in Sri Lanka and nowhere else is like that!)

Finally, the food.  It was very uninspiring for the cost.  The upper restaurant was not open the whole time we were there - so the only a la carte menu available was from the coffee shop.  

I think it's an absolute disgrace to charge the money they do - I was incredibly misled and I too will be lodging a formal complaint.

murph99,,Couples,"Beautiful hotel but not for us The Downeys, Cork Ireland",12/8/2025,"We've just returned from our honeymoon - a week in the Maldives(paradise) followed by a week in Sri Lanka staying in the Heritance Ahungalla. The hotel is beautiful just like any hotel in a major city let it be London, Dublin or New York so if its traditional Sri Lankan style your looking for than its not for you.
Our room was looking out onto the ocean however the water was unfortunately too rough for swimming. There wasn't a soul on the beach for the entire duration of our trip apart from the usual hawkers who camp out on the beach for the day in the hope of selling the odd sarong or two.
The food was nice but became extremely repetitive when your there for 6 days, bearing in mind there's nothing outside the hotel so no chance of eating anywhere else. If you like a drink and a bit of a buzz at nite then this is also not the hotel for you, the bars have no atmosphere.Your not encouraged to go out of the hotel however saying that there's nothing to go out for in the line of entertainment, shopping or eating just a little shop across the road which sells water and snacks which may come in handy as hotels prices are the same if not even more expenive than home.

our room was looking out onto the ocean however the water was unfortunately too rough for swimming. there wasn't a soul on the beach for the entire duration of our trip apart from the usual hawkers who camp out on the beach for the day in the hope of selling the odd sarong or two.
the food was nice but became extremely repetitive when your there for 6 days, bearing in mind there's nothing outside the hotel so no chance of eating anywhere else. if you like a drink and a bit of a buzz at nite then this is also not the hotel for you, the bars have no atmosphere.your not encouraged to go out of the hotel however saying that there's nothing to go out for in the line of entertainment, shopping or eating just a little shop across the road which sells water and snacks which may come in handy as hotels prices are the same if not even more expenive than home. once you walk out of the hotel you'll be surrounded by hawkers trying to sell you tours which can be annoying as they're fairly persistent.

If you wish to really see Sri Lanka then I would suggest that you stay here at the end of your holiday as it is quite far south and means that travel to places such as Kandy are extremely long and tiresome and the driving is something else to be seen, I would describe it as a 'white knuckle ride'!.

The hotel is well designed but I would struggle to place it in the 4-5* bracket (try out hotels in Malaysia and you will really see the difference).  There is a so called shop in the hotel which really does not sell any essentials such as shampoo so make sure you take your own hair products. Also, we bought factor 40 sun tan cream which did not work and we were severely burned (another couple had the same experience) so again, make sure you take your own sun tan creams and after sun with you.

Regarding the beach terrorists, they do hassle you.  We were followed for an hour on the beach by 5 of them who just would not give up, no matter how politely you said you weren't interested.  They called and shouted to you if you were sunbathing near the beach and the only thing to do was to completely ignore them.  One day we went outside the hotel to go the the pharmacy to buy some after sun lotion (due to the rubbish cream the shop had sold) and found exactly the same hassle, we lasted about 20 minutes before going back to the hotel.

However, I think this had more to do with wanting a tip.  One time they completely ignored the 'do not disturb sign' and still persisted.

The restaurant did offer a very good selection (buffet style) and quality of food, the only thing that let it down was the length of time it took you to get a drink when requested, especially as the ratio of staff to customers was overwhelming at times.

If you don't like being hassled then maybe this isn't the place for you.  In terms of the staff, all were very friendly and polite apart from one or two who seemed to have tipping on their agenda as a priority more than genuine customer service.

traveltimeCanberra,,,Reopened post Tsunami,6/6/2025,"The Triton has been renovated and relaunched at the Heritance Ahungalla (May 2006).  Under the management of Aitken Spence, a major Sri Lanken hotel group, they have attempted to move away from their previous 'all inclusive' package approach to become 'Sri Lanka's first 6 star hotel'.  To be honest, they have a long way to go to achieve this level.  
We visited in June, very shortly after they reopened.  In fact, building work wasn't completed and the new Spa will not be on line for 6 months or more.  
It is a bit hard to know how to be fair to this hotel. They've done a great job renovating the public areas of the hotel.  Although only one bar & the coffee shop were open when we were there they were very attractive, with attentive service and good (but not outstanding) food.  There was also a small libary, well stocked with books for beach reading. 
However the biggest drawback is the size of the bedrooms.  In comparison to other Sri Lankan top end hotels - such as the Galle Lighthouse Hotel or Dambulla Kandalama - the rooms and bathrooms (no bath provided) are very small.  Although nicely decorated they lack a feeling of space and light.  Plus the layout of the hotel means that many rooms look (indirectly) into other rooms.  
Staff vary from excellent (thoughtful and friendly) to down right annoying in their continual expectation of tips.  The better staff including the restaurant staff were good, but lifeguards and one room boy were very pushy.
Plus the internet access is ridiculously expensive ($US15 hour - over 4 times higher than anywhere else we stayed).  
The beach is long and undeveloped.  The two pools are spacious, with plenty of deckchairs (however there were only 15 - 30 people there at the time).

Julia M,,Family,"Unsanitary conditions, terrible food, old building, smells like grandma's old furniture",2/24/2025,"Good afternoon. I’m not a fan of leaving reviews and, in principle, too lazy to do this, however, after certain nuances, I still decided to write. I have been vacationing with my wife since the beginning of August in this hotel through the tour operator Anex Tour. After reading positive reviews and looking at beautiful photos on booking, we decided to go to this hotel without hesitation, it didn’t even bother us that it was not the season and that there were big waves on the side where the hotel is located at that time.
In general, I'll start with the positives.
Namely: the hotel is located among palm trees and many trees on which small chipmunks jump and beautiful birds fly, the beach is very large and wide, the length is about 3.5 km, but it is cleaned only directly in front of the hotel in the morning from among local vigilantes. which are photographed by a local police officer upon completion of work. The 5-star Heritance Hotel has: 2 swimming pools, one small gym, restaurant, one bar. That's basically all the advantages.)
I don’t want to be a boring person in your eyes, so that you don’t think: “Well, there are people who always don’t like something.” Because I thought so myself when I read several similar reviews before buying the tour. Arriving at the hotel, we were greeted by girls with white smiles. I was very pleased with the positive mood of the staff, always smiling. Always. But, as it turned out, from fulfilling my professional tasks of maintaining a comfortable client accommodation, this was the only well-developed skill.
Simply put, in addition to the fact that the hotel is over 60 years old, its technical condition leaves much to be desired. Apart from the smell of “grandmother’s sofa in the country,” no one plans to refresh the hotel and monitor its cleanliness, order in the premises, rooms, glass washing and sanitary disinfection!
On the first day we arrived and entered the room, I noticed that the drain in the shower was clogged and the flush in the toilet did not work well enough to fulfill its function. Going down to the restaurant, I am not a squeamish and meticulous person, I was not pleasantly surprised that the tables were simply sticky, like in a dumpling shop! The window glass is incredibly dirty and there are flies flying around the room and landing on your plate. My wife cried when she saw it all... she was in a terrible mood. Not once, not once during all the time were there paper napkins on the table. pepper shakers and salt shakers were very rarely found on tables. But what struck me and other visitors from Europe most of all was that 95% of the dishes were incredibly spicy! A couple of days before departure, I couldn’t resist and asked to see salads and hot dishes without “curry” and “black pepper”. I would NEVER call the restaurant a restaurant. They greet you beautifully, open the doors, smile, BUT the food and service are below par! After eating, you need to wait until the receipt is closed, and sign the zero receipt, indicating that you do not owe any money for the drinks. Yes, yes, even if you have “all inclusive”, even if you drank cola or local arak is free. The check takes a very long time. I left a lot of tips, but they still don’t want to work.
 On the opposite side of the so-called “restaurant” with flies, sticky tables, dirty glass, there is a bar. Where can you buy alcohol, fries and a burger. Most of the time we ate there, there is no spicy food at all! The all-inclusive option includes the above items and local alcoholic drinks. Everything else is paid. He works a couple of hours before lunch and an hour after for cooking.
By the way, after 24.00 it is impossible to drink cola, whiskey or smoke a pack of cigarettes. Everything in the hotel is closed. Outside the hotel, shops are closed after zero hours. For leisure, near the bar with paid drinks there is an area where a local musician plays until 23.00. Near the exit to the ocean, local traders and beggars are constantly on duty. Security guards do not allow them into the territory, but they watch you through a mesh fence when you go swimming at the beach. It looks funny, because you are 7-10 meters away on the sun loungers by the pool towards the ocean, you see them, and they look at you) they look at you, and you look at them) like in a zoo, it’s not clear just who the animal is.
The staff is very very lazy, no matter what anyone writes that they are trying. It is not true. While you give me a tip, they pretend. Sooo slow, very, very slow. And, of course, I couldn’t help but pay attention to the staff’s manicure and pedicure; this is a separate topic. There was a great desire to give nail scissors.
My appeal and review was sent not to criticize, but so that the management would take note and work on the mistakes. Because if you oppose yourself as 5 stars, then correspond, be so kind! But the bosses only taught me to smile and bow.

P.S.
On the day of departure, our flight was postponed several times. From early morning the hotel staff saw us sitting and waiting for our bus, but at 12.00 when we handed over our bracelets, we became a different kind of people. At 12.10, the wife asked the hostess for 2 free bottles of water to take with her to the airport, which they usually bring to the room, to which she replied with a smile: “and now it’s paid!” I was so amazed that I thought it was a joke, since I only didn’t tip chipmunks.

the staff is very very lazy, no matter what anyone writes that they are trying. it is not true. while you give me a tip, they pretend. sooo slow, very, very slow. and, of course, i couldn’t help but pay attention to the staff’s manicure and pedicure; this is a separate topic. there was a great desire to give nail scissors.
my appeal and review was sent not to criticize, but so that the management would take note and work on the mistakes. because if you oppose yourself as 5 stars, then correspond, be so kind! but the bosses only taught me to smile and bow.

p.s.
on the day of departure, our flight was postponed several times. from early morning the hotel staff saw us sitting and waiting for our bus, but at 12.00 when we handed over our bracelets, we became a different kind of people. at 12.10, the wife asked the hostess for 2 free bottles of water to take with her to the airport, which they usually bring to the room, to which she replied with a smile: “and now it’s paid!” i was so amazed that i thought it was a joke, since i only didn’t tip chipmunks.
in general, thanks to the ocean and the cool chipmunks, they did not disappoint us.",show original,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,1,5,4,4,2

We really liked the hotel.

Rooms: The rooms are very large. Comfortable. Cleaning is done every day and very efficiently. The room has a kettle, tea, coffee, sugar, milk powder, water, refrigerator, hair dryer, shampoo, shower gel, body lotion, toothbrushes, slippers, bathrobes.

Hotel: the hotel area is very clean and well maintained. The hotel is located right on the ocean. Very quiet and peaceful.
Very long coastline.

Meals: we only had breakfast. The food is good.
We had lunch and dinner at the hotel's Alya Carte restaurant. The only negative of the restaurant is the small selection of dishes. But everything we didn’t try was very tasty. The waiters were always attentive, polite, and neat.

Animation: every evening there was live music in the lobby. Artists came, danced, and put on a fire show. During the day there was water aerobics. Water polo and some other games)

Beach: the hotel is located right on the ocean. There were huge waves during our holiday. But we really liked it. We spent all our time in the water) if you walk along the beach to the left, there will be a lagoon. There were no waves there at all.

Infrastructure outside the hotel: there is nowhere to go. There is the only store in Sri Lanka with prices - food city. You can also buy fruits and alcohol. There is a clothing store and a jewelry store.

We took a tuk here and went to the beach club restaurant. It's right on the ocean. Menu in Russian. Everything is very delicious. And the staff is just wonderful.

There is also a restaurant if you walk along the beach to the left. Jungle beach.
