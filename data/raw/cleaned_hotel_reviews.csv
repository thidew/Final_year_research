I must thankful to them by giving this wonderful stay. I have reserved a delux room but they upgraded it to a suite. Everything was perfect. Buffet spread was very good and food was delicious. Cleanliness is at its max and there hospitality was great. Everything was great and nothing to complained. We will come back again definitly,positive

"We went to Heritance Ahungalla as a group of 7 adults for 2 nights stay. On arrival all of us had a perception that this is a 4 star property but after seeing the rooms and other amenities and the hospitality of staff, chef and services, we can definitely vouch for its 5 star category. We being vegetarians, apart from their big elaborate menus for breakfast and Dinners, chefs personally to care for our food and made all efforts to prepare veg food specially for us. Lady as PR manager Ms Dilsha was an exceptional Dimond star studded to this property. I have travelled to many countries but never seen such hospitality and personal take care by any hotel staff. It was not just us but she was all the time interacting with guests to make them comfortable at the property. Amazing experience !! Amazing Hotel !!",positive
Pros- at the beach. Lovely food. Clean and nice rooms. Cons- all the good restaurants are 20 minutes away in Bentota. The property’s hospitality is average. We’ve seen better hospitality in srilanka.,positive
"It is an affordable option among power constructions, but it has sufficient quality. The depreciation of the rupee is a factor, but the cost-performance is unbelievable. Especially when my companion fell ill and we requested a doctor, the attention to detail with room service was also impressive. Thank you.",positive
Great food whopping varieties in food,positive
Thanks a lot for another fantastic stay. Will come definitely come again and again….,positive
Highly recommended hotel with all mod-cons and facilities right on the beach.,positive

"Nice property, Excellent service all round by the staff. Everyone has a smile and courteous and considering clients requests positively. Great work. Keep it up",positive
Very old property . Not maintained properly.check in/ out process took much time. Staff also not friendly and co operative.,negative
"If you want to travel with a stay in slow life, this place is a good choice. You can complete everything in the hotel. But if you want to see around, not a good choice. Far from cities, also not many restaurants near. The first infinity pool was not so impressive. Nowadays, you can see the more impressive infinity pool in all over the world.",neutral
"The hotel needs refurbishment. Some of the corridors and courtyards were in a very poor state. The meals were OK, although not up to 5 star standard. There was only one ala carte restaurant. The restaurant staff were a credit to the hotel - always willing to help. Unfortunately, cant say the same of the reception staff who would benefit from a communication skills training course. The Gym was very poorly equipped and certainly did not merit a 5 star status.",negative
"Everything is astonishing, except F/O seems disconnected to the hospitality attitude while the other staff already attached professionally.",neutral
"Hotel was wonderful from first step to the last good bye. Staff was amazing, quick check in and check out and hotel makes sure the safety of the guests. Pools were properly maintained and hotel is in walking distance to the ahungalla beach view point. a must visit place. Its a hotel which makes Sri Lanka proud ! cheers",positive
"Staff was very friendly,But my kids didn’t like the Chinese buffet,Food to be improved.",neutral
A friend had recommended the Heritance hotels so we had high expectations. The hotel met and exceeded our expectations. This is a beautiful facility. Food and service were top notch.,positive

"the time we spent there was amazing and wonderful. we loved everyhting about this hotel and wanted to stay longer. The hotel staff were very welcoming and nice and the hotel was clean. The facilities and the pool were oh so breathtaking. I would definitely revisit the hotel if I ever visit the area again. The food was great but I have to just add one note, If you are a Muslim or you are nonalcoholic person ask the restaurant staff about the salad dressings if there is any wine or alcohol added in the food. My wife found out that they add wine with the salad dressings especially vinegar. Ask for Halal food and alcohol free drinks and food...",positive
The hotel is an excellent place for any type of family or couple. The staff was impeccable in every aspect and the rooms were spacious. Modern yet with a Sri Lankan feel. I would definitely stay here again.,positive
"Our planned highlight, to the end of our Sri Lankan tour, was a frustrating disappointment. We arrived tired and sick, hoping for a clean comfortable room and some simple food. Even though we had booked and paid 6 months earlier, it took a long time to allocate us a room. The room smelled of mould and mould was easily found in the bathroom. My wife complained, but all the staff could do was find the missing outdoor furniture. At dinner, the first night, we had difficulty finding plain food, that would not aggravate our upset stomachs. The chef kindly offered to prepare mashed potatoes, peas and grilled chicken, for us, the next night. However, the next day, this offer was undone by management, who declared we had been selected for ""Fine dining"". Fearing this was Sringlish for extra spicy, we gave up and went to bed early, without dinned, which we had already paid for. At least at checkout, as some compensation, the hotel did not charge for the sandwich and hamburger, we had at the bar. After my wife presented mouldy toiletries to management, they did offer to change rooms, on the second day; but it was too little too late. The hotel has an impressive entrance and sea view. But what good are those when the hotel fails the basics of room and food.",negative
"Stay was great but 1. Considering there is nothing nearby to eat the food choices for A la cart and Room service are very very limited. 2. Phone receiver was smelly. None of the buttons worked 3. Door stopper broken and the the door kept banging if left open for a few seconds 4. Space beneath bed had not been swept or cleaned in a long time 5. TV was not working . Hotel staff were warm and Service was lovely. The location and rooms were fabulous, so we overlooked all faults except Point number 1 on Food.",negative
Awesome! So relaxing,positive
"It was very good hotel for stay, but there was good options for vegetarian.Food for non vegetarian was also not upto the mark of 5 star. The amount they charge for Buffet is exorbitant compared to the quality of the good they provide.",positive
"Amazing 2 nights spent at Heritance Ahungalla during our trip around Sri Lanka. The pool was amazing, rooms well appointed and comfortable, great selection of food in the restaurant, and situated on one of the most beautiful beaches in Sri Lanka. Above all the professionalism and friendliness of the staff was second to none. Will certainly stay here on my next visit to Sri Lanka and would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.",positive
Very Good. Recommended,positive
"I thought the ""fine dining"" restaurant was disappointing and over-priced. The hotel felt too ""Buckland's Holiday Camp"" for me. Couldn't wait to leave each day on other activities outside the hotel. It looked to me also that the original building design had been messed with. The model airplane at the end of the 'infinity"" pool was ridiculous. Surely Geofrey bawa would not have approved.",negative
"This hotel is beautiful. 2 swimming pools, that meet the beach. Good food and variety - mostly local style. Very comfortable rooms. Our rooms had balconies overlooking the garden and beach. Staff were friendly, excellent English and couldn't do enough to make our stat memorable. Highly recommend. Good midway point between Bentota and Galle.",positive
"it was a really relaxing hotel, staff couldnt do enough for you and were very friendly and spoke english.",positive
Hotel located in good Hotel and some of the staff were very friendly. Had to always wait over 1 hour to have meals served after they were ordered. _x000D_ _x000D_ The website indicated that drivers got free accommodation and 3 meals but the staff did not honor this and made our driver pay. It was very get hold of the Manager to complain so something could be done. Our Driver did not end up getting the money back either> Very Disappointing. _x000D_ _x000D_ Sport Staff (Raja) was very good and was very helpful.. One out of many!!,negative
the hotel is beautiful with great view from the lobby. the sandy beach is quiet.,positive
"after a tiring drive, the pool just across the lobby is refreshing and you just want to dive in. The music from the bar next door keeps u upbeat, and top class service wants to enjoy the moment._x000D_ Awesome place to relax and unwind.",positive
The service was lovely at the hotel. The staff were friendly and were not only helpful but always greated us with a smile. The hotel itself is beautiful with it's own private beach.,positive
"Assez cher pour ce séjour qui était très bien mais pas exceptionnel. L’hôtel est rempli de monde partout. Les 2 piscines sont grandes heureusement mais pas d’impression d’exclusivité et d’intimité. Les repas ne sont pas terribles mais nous avons passé 3jours de repos, et la chambre était très agréable.",neutral
"Wir sind spontan und leider nur für eine Nacht in dieses Hotel, aber es war einer der besten Aufenthalte des Urlaubs: das Personal war super freundlich und hilfsbereit. Ich hatte meinen kleinen Rucksack im Uber vergessen und mir wurde SOFORT geholfen, alles wieder zurückzubekommen. Das Essen und die Zimmer waren auch top!",positive

建物は年季が入っており、少し古臭い。 部屋は可もなく不可もなく。 清潔感はある。,negative
朝食からディナーまでビュッフェで、作り置きのものしかない。全く美味しいと感じられなかった。 大規模なホテルで団体客も多いので仕方がないかもしれないが、１人で泊まる時は、ここではなく、小さな居心地の良いホテルを選ぼうと思う。 食事以外は建物もプールもキレイで悪くない。,negative
Galleから電車でAhungalleに向かいました。日が出てると汗だくになりますが、駅からは歩ける距離です。 ホテルはBawa建築の大変ステキな作りです！！部屋も広々していて、1階だとすぐに庭やプールに出ることができます。 小さなアリがお部屋に入ってきますが、小さなお客さまと思って迎えてあげるといいと思います(笑) プールも2箇所、卓球、バトミントンコート(屋外)、テニスコート(屋外)もありました。 食事は、ビュッフェが大変充実しています。室内/屋外でも取ることができ、雰囲気も良いです。 また年末にも来る予定です！,positive
1日だけの滞在です。一泊一部屋1万円ちょっとで泊まれて大満足でした。 [スタッフ] みなさんフレンドリー＆親切。笑顔で迎えてくれました。 日本語の話せるスタッフもいました（中国人と間違われましたが） [お部屋] ツインベッドをゲットできました。お部屋は広々としていて快適。 バルコニーからは海が見えました。 ウェルカムフルーツは、マンゴー、バナナ、パッションフルーツ・・と スリランカフルーツがたくさん！ できればもう一泊したかったな・・・。 [ビーチ] 少し波が高かったですが、インド洋に沈む夕日が見れました。 ただスリランカのビーチ全般に言えることですがビーチがプライベートビーチ になっていないため現地の人＆物売りが多いので注意 [客層] お値段が安いこととコロンボから近いこともあってスリランカ人が多かったです。 次に多いのは中国人。食事中にＤＶＤ大音量でかけていたりしていて閉口。,positive
先ず、エントランスの開放感とスタッフの笑顔の対応に感激しました。客室もとても綺麗に掃除されており、茶色で統一されていてリラックス出来るリゾートホテルそのものでした。アメニティーも多く、シャワーも凄く良かったです。_x000D_ エントランスのプールは夜ライトアップされていて綺麗で、泳いでいて気持ちよかったな♪_x000D_ ＳＰＡも利用しましたが、心からリラックスでき、夕食のビュッフェも美味しかったです！_x000D_ 町からは離れていますが、タクシーやトゥクトゥクで１５～２０分位で着きます。静かな所なので返ってよかったです。又宿泊したい、最高のホテルでした！！！！！,positive

临到出行前，酒店才通知说没有房间，给替换到另外一家酒店。对酒店这钟行为非常鄙视。抵达到酒店前台交涉期间，路线有外国团队来办理入住，个人觉得就是把我们预定的酒店让给了别人。酒店真的很美，环境不错，早晚餐也非常丰盛，对于这次没有住到这家酒店感觉很遗憾。,negative

Rätt trist atmosfär på hotellet. Stranden är ej badbar pga starka strömmar. Få bra restauranger i närheten och hotellets priser på mat och dryck är alldeles för höga. Kommer aldrig bo där igen och rekommenderar det inte.,negative
This resort stands out as one of the resorts in Sri Lanka which involves the guests for some activities through the day or simply relax and enjoy the vast beach or pool or the room itself. The food is predominantly European with few Lankan dishes. Any other dishes such as Indian may not be up to the mark yet but the chefs are putting in an effort to get it right.,positive
"Our check-in experience was smooth and quick. The room we stayed in was clean and spacious, which we appreciated. However, the biggest issue was that the AC in our room didn’t work properly, and we had to endure an uncomfortable, hot night. Although the maintenance team tried their best to resolve the issue, they were unsuccessful, and we received no apology or acknowledgment from the hotel management. On top of that, we were contacted about our check-out time, which added to the frustration. The food was tasty, but the buffet selection was quite average",neutral
My parents had a nice stay which was booked for my mums birthday. Service and the cleanliness of the room was very good. They arranged a cake and helped celebrate mums birthday in a special way. Thank you for a such a nice stay! Looking forward to be back.,positive

"It was a very pleasant stay with heritance ahungalle. Rooms were very clean, comfortable, and facilities available were exceptional. However, dinner was below my expectation, as although the spread was extensive, nothing was tasty, as those lacked the flavour. Also, the table arrangement was a chaos, since the restaurant staff gave priority for group travellers, with no concern at all for small families.",neutral

"It was a mother and daughter. The staff at the hotel from the housekeeping, the restaurant , the reception right down to the pool life guard were amazing. Nothing was too much trouble for any of them. They truly made our stay memorable and we would stay there again in a heartbeat! We requested for sone crab curry during dinner and they were all so willing to please us. Thank you again to Pradeep who took great care of my mum and the rest of the restaurant staff for being so accommodating! The Heritance group should be so proud of their team at Ahungalla!",positive

"We are a family of five: two adults and three children. This was the perfect property- stayed here for 3 nights and did not want to leave! Right from the start, the tall and beautiful Ms. Supunika took care of us. There was some confusion with our booking at the start which she handled very gracefully. We had room 201 and 203, easily the best rooms on the property, ocean view and the children had poo view. The rooms are very large:45sqm of pure bliss. 203 has a massive screen TV so the children were very happy. There was water polo in the pool and we enjoyed games very much. The breakfast was a huge, scrumptious spread that we looked forward to every morning!!! Each dish was absolutely delicious! This is a perfect property for a family!",positive
Nicely designed property with lots of natural elements. Sea is rough mostly if not always - hence settled for pool. Front office lacks lighting and the staff were slow in figuring out simple calculations - wish they could smile a bit. Understandably the security is tight - wish they could be more courteous - this is hospitality industry - everyone is looking forward to improved occupancy rates.,positive
"This was a real haven, a complete getaway from the madding crowd. Beautiful pristine beach, although the sea was very choppy it was still fun battling the waves. The show stopper was the food, they really delivered on every level here, in fact, it was a tad too much but that's what holidays are about... I recommend this place 100%, to be honest, anything after this will probably be a letdown, although you might appreciate the rest from the indulgence. 5/5 on all counts, there were no complaints, Chef Thilian was a great host in the dining room, nothing was too much trouble...I will be back soon...thanks again.",positive

"Fantastic but would have been nearly perfect if there hadn't been a wild dog lose in the corridor howling and looking very threatening at 3am. It's nearly unavoidable to have them trying to get in close due to the wonderful open modernist architecture, but staff should be patrolling the open spaces at night much more regularly. My impression is that staff doesn't patrol these spaces at all at night. Also since it's not easy to get to a town for supplies, a small convenience store should be included, where you could buy personal items, like sunscreen, shaving cream, etc.",positive

"This was a lively way to finish our 3 weeks in Sri Lanka. The spa has beautiful treatments to help unwind and the pool area and gardens were lively and relaxing. We were there at monsoon season, so had the daily downpour but this did not dampen our stay. The beach was too rough for swimming and the beach sharks ( locals selling sarongs and free trips to see the turtles and local gem shop were out in full force). The rooms were lovely and the staff so helpful and always smiling. A lovely retreat at the end of our vacation.",positive
"We felt we could not relax whilst in the grounds, the local sellers both men and women, hid in the bushes of the hotel on the beach, waiting to get people's attention. As soon as you stepped onto the beach, you were surrounded by them. Also so much rubbish strewn about the perimeter. Overall the hotel lacked any atmosphere, maybe it is too large for that? The staff were all lovely and friendly. For the money we both felt very let down, it is marked as a 5 star hotel but I would disagree with that.",negative
"Enjoyed our stay here. Very friendly and accommodating staff. Room was large, spacious, clean and we had a large balcony facing the pool and beach. Dc enjoyed the swimming, table tennis, pool table. Breakfast buffet was great. Room service was equally good even though choices were limited. Laundry service was efficient. Getting about wasn't too hard as hotel could arrange for cabs. The gorgeous Geoffrey Bawa-designed hotel and the lovely staff were the main attraction for us. Overall, had a wonderful stay and would definitely recommend a stay at this hotel.",positive

Stayed 4 nights at the Heritance. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff and the room was perfect - spacious & clean with a huge balcony overlooking the pool and sea.

We had a 2nd floor room with good-sized outdoor deck overlooking one of the large pools and a tremendous view of the ocean. The room was spacious and nicely furnished. Wifi in room for no extra charge. Very friendly and prompt service at all times. Spacious grounds that were well cared for. Had monkey's occassionally in large room right near room that we could view from deck or while in swimming pool. Food very good. A con is that ocean waves were very rough, but beach was wonderful and swimming pools were great with view of surf from pools.",positive

リゾート自体は重厚でゆとりのある造りになっており、大きなプールや開放感溢れるダイニングエリアでは快適に過ごすことができました。またリゾートから続く広い砂浜とそこに沈む夕日の景色は特筆物です。ただ、ホテルを一歩出るとそこは雑多で空気の悪い喧騒地帯。陸側も海側もしつこい物売りと客引きだらけで多少のストレスを感じることは否めません。食事は悪くないですが、外で気軽に食べ歩きがてきないことを考えるとバリエーションが少なすぎる。。。大きな街からもかなり離れているので不便を感じるかも。価格に対して環境面やソフト面が見合ってない印象は否めませんでした。,neutral

The hotel needs a good clean from top to bottom. Except for the pool and bar area it is all pretty grubby eg. the coffee shop chair arms and tabletops are black with dirt. The floor in the hotel room was gritty and some of the linen was gray with dirt or age. Even the most basic accommodation we stayed at in Sri Lanka were better maintained than this.

"we chose this hotel for 5 days rest on our arrival in Sri Lanka. Whilst the hotel itself is lovely and our room was fantastic - clean, large, great balcony, lovely big clean bathroom - we were disappointed by the aggressive sales tactics of the staff every time we were in the main hotel area. We were constanly being asked if we wanted to try the spa, the fine dining restaurant or the outrageously expensive barbecue on the beach. We found the hotel bar and restaurant to be very over priced as well. This is definitely more of a family hotel so those without children may consider other options. There is a limited amount to do outside the hotel so may be better for people on an all inclusive or at least half board package. We did appreciate the hotel's facilities - two lovely clean pools, tennis courts, table tennis all available but the beach isn't really very usable due to the number of salesmen on it (not the hote's fault).",neutral
"When I walked in the lobby, it was very crowede and noisy, I saw the swimming pool from lobby, it was as crowded as disneyland, I cannot believe this is a 5 star hotel. And the swimming pool was somehow under maintance, can see the view as saw on the website. No bath tub in the bathroom. My flight was 12 noon, so I had an early breakfast at 7:20am, the breakfast time started at 7am, but it was chaos when I walked in the restaurant, staff in the restaurant were chatting, laughing, there's no Professional at all!! I was sooo disappointed at Heritance Ahungalla hotel!!!",negative

"Never have we ever been into such as filthy, serivce-lacking beach resort. The whole premises is a run-down. The restaurants are not clean: sticky tables covered with juice stains; rotten salad, bread crumbs and fish bones seem to be part of the chairs and cushions. Serving beverages with cracked cups/glasses which also have dead insects gluing to them. The food is not well prepared neither fresh, including the seafood! Annoyed to be served with stale seafood in a beach resot! Hotel beach is decorated with trash, including broken bottles. Guests pay 5-star-resort tariff while 1-star serive is provided.",negative

バワ建築好きなので、ゆっくりしたいと3泊しました。部屋も素敵だったし、ご飯も美味しかったし、ビーチも目の前で、滞在自体は満足のいくものでした。 しかし、それを台無しにする残念なことがありました。 １つは、滞在が週末だったため、とにかくうるさかった事。隣の部屋では、若い男女が10人以上で、爆音の音楽かけたり、バルコニーで騒いだりしていて、注意してもらってもまた騒ぐという感じでした。プールも若者のグループや家族連れで騒がしいので、ゆっくり過ごしたい人は、週末は避けた方がいいと思います。 あと、支払を現地払いにしていたのですが、チェックイン時に請求された金額と、Agodaで予約した時の金額が異なったので、チェックアウト時に確認したのですが、係りの人は「間違いありません」の一点張りでした。急いでいたのもあり、あとはAgodaに間に入ってもらって、話をしてもらいますと伝えて、ホテルを出ようとしたら、他のスタッフが調べるので時間をくれと言って来ました。結局、ホテル側のミスであることが判明しましたが、予約管理も出来てないのかな？と、気分が悪いままホテルを後にしました。 現地払いのプランで予約する場合、支払時に確認を忘れないようにして下さい。,negative

辺鄙なとこにあるが、とてもよかった。_x000D_ 部屋からは海とプールを眺めながら、テラスもあるしそこでルームダイニングや朝食も食べれる。_x000D_ ただ、アメニティが五つ星ホテルとうたっているわりにはそうでもないが、たっぷりのお湯（シャワーのみ）が出るのは嬉しい。_x000D_ プライベートビーチではないので、ビーチボーイがしつこいので、プールサイドで過ごすことになるかと。_x000D_ 朝食のみのプランだったのでディナーブッフェは別途払いだったが、ルームナンバーを聞かれたので、それでokだと思っていたら、後でスタッフが怒りながらサインしろとやってきた。自分の確認不足だったかもしれないが、スタッフによって対応にバラつきあり。_x000D_ 基本的にはスリランカ人らしく、人懐こく気さくなスタッフが多いが、そうでないスタッフもいる。_x000D_ バワホテルなのでロケーションは最高。ビーチステイなら一週間いても飽きなそう。_x000D_ 基本的に欧米人が多数を占めるが、中国人も多いので、中国人に間違われると対応が悪くなりそうな雰囲気はあった。,positive

Alla är gästvänliga på Sri Lanka men på Heritance Ahungalla upplevde vi att alla var genuint service-minded och intresserade av att vi skulle ha en bra vistelse. Det gällde verkligen hela personalen! Hotellet har två pool-områden och det som först kändes som ett rum långt bort i hotellkomplexet när vi leddes dit visade sig ligga vid den djupaste (och i vårt tycke bästa)poolen. We will be back!,positive
"Very beautiful hotel We had 2 nights at it. The room was so clean. The main pool is clean, but the second pool is not. The staff are not friendly at the reception. We called the reception 3 times for the laundry services, and they told us at morning will bring our clothes, but they didn't till noon . First day it was too noisy because of the guy who was cutting the grass (more than 4 hours) and and no action from the reception after calling them. After our complaints to the supervisor, they bring us a fruit basket 😂. Also the next day the maintenance where working between the rooms at 7 am. Also some of the restaurant staff were so rude. Also the second day, the guy of cutting grass🤯. You will not feel relax.",positive

We were asked to go to the coffee shop, over there we were told they would prepare something veg and would take 45 minutes.

We were loking forward to staying at this hotel on the coast as we were not travelling to the Maldives. However we were dissapointed with the service and food during our stay. The only savibg grace was being upgraded and the room we got was fantastic. The hotel is set in a great location but if you do not like being hasseled on the so called private beach then this hotel is not for you. There were many locals on the beach trying to sell guests goods in full view of the scurity guards.

"Weitläufige Hotelanlage mit vergleichsweise großen und schönen Pools. Im September (Nebensaison) war das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis sehr gut (DZ inkl. Frühstück für 80€). In der Hauptsaison (Winter) liegen die Preise des selben Zimmers bei 150€ bis 250€. Das ist meiner Ansicht nach überteuert. Die Anlage liegt direkt am ruhigen Strand von Ahungalla. Außerhalb des Hotels gibt es nicht viel zu tun, da es in Ahungalla keine wirkliche touristische Infrastruktur gibt. Wer aber Ruhe sucht, ist im Heritance gut aufgehoben. Die Außenanlage ist sehr gefpflegt und verfügt über einen großen und alten Baumbestand. Schön für Kinder: es haben sich immer wieder Affen blicken lassen und es gibt viele Streifenhörnchen und Krebse zu beobachten. Die Brandung ist relativ kräftig, weswegen das Hotelpersonal eindringlich vom Baden im Meer abgeraten hat. Das ist aber fast überall in der Gegend so... Der Service war gut, wobei das Personal teilweise einen unzufriedenen, gequälten Eindruck gemacht hat. Die Arbeitsbedingungen scheinen evtl. nicht die besten zu sein.",neutral

"I chose Heritance because my family was holidaying there. The best part of the experience was the comfortable deluxe room with the best mattress I've ever slept on and a balcony overlooking the pool. I felt very relaxed and the staff was friendly and courteous. What disappointed me was the breakfast and dinner buffets(I stayed three nights) There was nothing special about the menu and my palate was bored. Everything tasted the same. To me the meals ordered via the in-room dining service tasted slightly better. Overall, it was a comfortable stay. It's a nice hotel if you want to relax, swim and enjoy the beach",neutral
"We had a wonderful stay at this hotel! It offered great value for money, with clean and comfortable rooms at a reasonable price. The location was perfect, close to key attractions and easily accessible. As a couple traveling together, we appreciated the peaceful atmosphere and the friendly staff who made our stay even better.",positive
"Staff is very friendly, but the hotel is very outdated. For the price you pay there are better or cheaper options available in the surrounding area. Facilities are ok. Rooms are very old. It looks like the hotel did very small to keep the place presentable. The only good thing is the pool. Big and great for kids. Restaurants are also not bad and food prices are fair. We had a good time but I personally believe that the hotel management can do more to keep the place more vibrant. Also checkin experience is somewhat strange where guests can feel little unwelcome with the process in place. We got electrocuted when using the hair dryer. Unit was definitely faulty. We reported this to the hotel but no management came to investigate or consult our family. We manage to get a replacement and luckily it wasn't a big accident. I'm not sure if the hotel deemed safety of guest as their utmost priority. But in our case, it felt as though they just simply ignored. I don't think we will visit there again. Locationwise, it's a good place.",neutral
"I requested a ""room with as much ocean view as possible"" in advance, and they granted it. The sound of the waves heard from the balcony is the best background music.

"If you’ve ever been to an all-inclusive in the Caribbean, then you’ll feel right at home here. The hotel is beautiful and service is better than most places in Sri Lanka, but the location is remote, there’s nothing to do off the resort unless you go to Bentota (20 mins away by tuk tuk). It features buffet for all 3 meals and nightly entertainment. You can also order a la carte in their restaurants, with the Mustard Cafe serving seafood priced the same as their beach restaurant and was quite good. We stayed for 2 nights and we noticed during the week the hotel catered to elderly Package tourists from Europe (the only place I saw overweight people in the whole country!) and younger Russians that came on the weekend. It’s right on the beach but waves were usually a bit rough so most people stayed by the pool. Come here if you want a beautiful resort with no intention of leaving the grounds or experiencing any local culture.",positive

"Good stay, although there's nothing to do in Ahungalla. Better to stay near Galle or anywhere else south or north with more happening. Food at the hotel was overpriced and there were few local alternatives without taking a taxi ride at least 10 mins away. We found an excellent beach place not far from the hotel and eat there most evenings. The pool, sunbathing in the garden and the beach are great if you want to do Absolutely Nothing.",positive
"Two huge, beautiful pools. Helpful and unobtrusive staff. Spacious rooms with nice views. Buffet breakfast and dinner are good, but if you didn't pay for full board, skip the dinner buffet and get the rice and curry at the a la carte restaurant: more than you can eat at half the price. Room service menu is not too exciting, I'd suggest making the trip to the restaurant. Beds are soft, but we got two single mattresses put together instead of a double, which was a bit annoying. Spa: Decent massages if a little pricey. Very nice hotel, no real complaints except for the website: the hotel did not respond to repeated emails before we arrived, and there are no directions or tips for how to get here on the website.",positive
"Some of the facilities were pretty good, like the pool, proximity to beach etc however the rooms were very dated for a supposed 5 star resort. The staff were generally ok but check in and check out was ridiculously slow to where we were running half an hour late for our transfer on check out due to the pace in which the staff conducted themselves. The hotel is very expensive given the rooms etc, when I pay 5 star prices I expect 5 star rooms and facilities.",neutral

"Ahungalla Heritance Hotel is reassuring when you arrive through its private drive after passing the entrance arch gate. It keeps being reassuring when you discover the open reception to the swimming pool that visually extends straight into the Indian Ocean just few meters away until … you end up checking in at a bar behind the reception that was very dark as most of its lights were switch off; was it a try of being Eco friendly ?? We had a strange feeling that the hotel was not up to its 5*. This obvious detail was like the top of an iceberg; will we discover the rest of it along our stay? Was Heritance a 5* iceberg? The room was ok, yet had aged and would need a lift. There was no safe deposit (5*?). The room maintenance appeared secondary as we noticed an obvious splash of dirt on the terrace door window and one of the door lock was broken. At “Mustard coffee shop”, we ordered seafood salad, it came with no salad or veggies (misleading salad term). We checked the “UpperRestaurant” menu and were not impressed by its presentation neither by the incomprehensive culinary composition of its expensive dishes. The restaurant was empty … lack of soul, poor lighting, no spark. Instead we went to this little Coconut Hut restaurant down the beach out of the hotel, where we really had a superb and reasonable diner, thank you to Berthy the owner for his welcome. We recommend it. Back to our room, we were not blown by the auto glorifying video of Heritance Ahungalla that was played in random on the hotel TV channel, it sounded too superlative to be true. The Heritance corporate management needs to open its eyes, international real 5* hotel are on their way to Sri Lanka and soon they may be at the origin of the end of Heritance Hotels 5 * era. The F & B department should also be worry and revise its restaurants concepts and put its heart and mind into it.",neutral
"The Hotel was built in 1983 but has been maintained quite well over the years. There is a Spa, which, however, is is not so special. The beach just in front of the hotel is nice but there are salespeople walking around who can be quite annoying sometimes. Those people are not allowed on the hotel property and thus it is possible to have some quiet time a bit further up on the beach on the sunchairs. The fine dining restaurant ""The Upper Room"" is excellent, so is the breakfast buffet.",positive

着いた瞬間、バワ設計のプールはとても美しい。だがチェックインするのに長い時間待たされ、何かと思えば「ウェルカムドリンクが来ますのでお待ちください」って。本末転倒でしょう。たのんでないし。部屋に飲み物用意すればよいこと。総じてスタッフの教育がもう少し必要と感じました。,negative
直前になると値段がかなり落ちるのでオススメです。プールが大きいからか、子供も割合が多少多い印象です。 スイートは、部屋の作りが無駄なだけなので、ワンランク落とした部屋の方がよろしいかと思われます。ホテル門扉を出たところにたむろするトゥクトゥクは案の定ですので、UberなりPickMeなりで配車した方が健全です。,neutral

The room was just beauuuuuuuuutifullllllllllll! the design and finish is so amazing. Such a nice color palette for the room we absolutely loved it. The staff is soooooooo warm and welcoming. The initial welcome felt like we were royalty. They handed us some local sweets followed by wet towels and welcome drinks. The staff engaged with us with a lot of warmth. The value for money is excellent. The breakfast lay out is beautiful with good taste and a huge variety. The resort design is amazing with a lot of local and Dutch design elements. The pools were warm and felt just right. Overall we really really enjoyed our stay there.,positive

The staffs were very friendly. The attention to detail and the overall quality truly made my stay enjoyable. Thank you for providing such a fantastic experience—I look forward on returning!,positive
"Dinner and breakfast were incredibly satisfying, offering a wide variety of options. The beach area is also amazing.",positive
"The location is good, there is a long stretch of beach to walk down. The staff are friendly and helped with any issues we faced, they even upgraded us when the AC was not working. The buffet and alacarte was really good, when there was a hiccup in the order the resturant offered to remake the dish for tomorrow.",positive
"I decided to book this place because I needed some peace of mind to relax and they proved it was the best choice. the staff are highly professional and they do more than the required to make you satisfied. Everywhere some disturbances may occur but the way they solve it is the most important thing so I would like to thank them for everything and especially Dilsha for everything she did with us. High quality Spa, super delicious food, outstanding hospitality,big room size, the property is built inside the nature so you can expect an exceptional atmosphere.",positive

"The location near the beach. Beautiful old hotel. Rooms were very clean. Friendly, helpful staff.",positive
"When we arrived, the room was ready. We were served welcome drinks which were fresh fruit juices. The hotel room and the porch outside, overlooking the swimming pool and after that the sea, were very good. Baby cot and tub was provided on request. The premises of the hotel were vast, and roaming in and around the hotel was fun. There was live music in the evening for both the days that we were there. A la Carte Restaurant was very nice. They had the best Sri Lankan food that we tasted. Breakfast Buffet had many options, and multiple types of salads and sandwiches which we absolutely enjoyed.",positive
"Nice swimming pools, nice garden, amazing staff and food with huge variety. Lot of space in the rooms as well.",positive
"Breakfast great, staff receptive, all food excellent. Hats off to two staff members Dil, who seemed to be everywhere every day. Every Hotel needs a Dilith fixer, sorter, meeter, greeter immediately likeable, shows genuine concern and solves problems. A great face for the Hotel and it's high standards. Also, a great mover on the dance floor where she encouraged several guests to get up and boogie. They just needed to be told!. She told them. They loved it! The other Dil is Dilishia (prob spelled wrong) who serves drinks at the cocktail bar (amongst other stuff) and does so with thoughtfulness, efficiency and class. Always smiling, always with eyes to the customer for easy contact. Happy to assist. Couldn't fault any staff members, but these two stood out for me.",positive
friendly staff nice environment,positive
"Pool was great for the kids. So much space for guests and privacy. Rooms on the new wing were nice and modern with ample space and a good view. Breakfast and dinner buffets were well organized, very tasty and a good spread. The local Sri Lankan food was also very tasty. Staff were very good. Special mention to Kalinga running the bar in the day service by the poolside. Lifeguards deserve a special mention, as very helpful to us and the kids.",positive

Very comfortable stay. Good property. Near to the turtle hatchery. Good food.,positive
"Unexpectedly very nice. I booked a hotel with mixed feelings due to some bad remarks on the web. However, the Heritance is a well aged hotel that currently faces the odds of Covid recovery and also undergoing the necessary revamp work. The staff is great and I cannot share the bad reviews on the web. I guess it is related to some “All-in” guests expecting an all-in hospitality on the press of a button, forgetting that kindness also needs kindness on the side of the guest.",positive
"I guess i loved everything about the hotel. What an amazing location, right on the beach, the lobby couldn't be better with a view of swimming pool and then the ocean. Rooms are comfortable, spacious and very clean. Furnitures are excellent. Overall hotel ambience is so good. They conducted some cultural shows for the guest and has some live music. Hotel staff were polite and helpful. It was a memorable stay for us",positive
"Great place to relax, food was alright.",positive
Definitely not five stars :) extras are very expensive. But overall not bad hotel :),positive
Beautiful open spaces and our room looked over the beach for sunsets. The room was large and clean and there were things to do while it rained. Go to the spa !!!,positive

"My husband and I stayed here with friends for four nights after we had been travelling around Sri Lanka. We ended up staying at the hotel for pretty much our whole four days there as we were enjoying relaxing and also there were government enforced curfews and things were difficult at that time. The hotel was large but because the staff were super nice so it always felt intimate. I was 5 months pregnant and always felt well looked after and cared for by the staff. Our room and bathroom was large with lovely character and a balcony. The rooms varied in size but all were comfortable. The rooms were well equipped with everything we needed and anything extra we just called reception for and they were very happy to come and sort anything. Our Aircon stopped working at 4am and a maintenance person came up immediately to look at it. Namal did a wonderful job freshening up our room every day, and we were always excited to see what creative bed decorations he'd left for each of us after breakfast. The breakfast was very good. We ate lunch at the pool bar every day and dinner at the restaurant every evening - these both had outside areas so we were able to always be outside. The food was good and a good price, but the menu was a little small to eat there every day! We enjoyed both pools very much. We played table tennis and tennis, but the net took a couple of days to be put up (it was in town being serviced) and there were only two rackets. We used the laundry service which was great and a very good price. We all had massages which were wonderful and the therapists were lovely, but it was expensive. The hotel provided a room for our driver for free and offered his meals for around £1 a meal, so obviously we were able to pay for that.",positive
The manager was fantastic and helped with all aspects of our stay.,positive
it was probably off season so not crowded at all. really enjoyed the property was large and so airy,positive
What a beautiful property with a clean beach. Clean Rooms and great staff. They have two excellent pools. Easy Check in and Check Out. Its the perfect resort to just relax and rejuvinate. Amazing food at the pool,positive
Comfortable bed and breakfast was excellent,positive
The service at dinner was extremely slow but the staff and management was apologetic about that,negative
"We booked for 2 nights unexpectedly as the election curfew messed with our original plans. The resort was mostly empty. It's not a full all-inclusive, meaning some guests pay a la carte. For the all-inclusive, the selection is OK - local spirits and a short list of cocktails. Wine is only served in the restaurant at lunch and dinner, which is weird. Food was good, but couldn't help the feeling that because it was not fully occupied the choice wasn't all there. The pool is nice, the beach is nearby (but not really a great beach, some serious surf). Rooms were OK, very clean, wifi was fast and the overall experience positive. Staff were extremely friendly and welcoming, which helped a lot. The gym was also a welcome addition - nothing big or fancy but there to be used, which is always a nice touch.",neutral

we had a suite and never expected that the bath/showe will lick - every time we took a shower we had to call housekeeping to clean the bathroom because it was full of water licking everywhere... there is a big potential for this hotel but it feel like an old and not renovated,negative
The buffet was good. Variety of snacks. Lovely decorations.,positive
"The best thing about this hotel is the nature. You will be surrounded by monkeys, birds, chipmunks, iguanas (who may sometimes even swim in the pool :) ), little crabs, not to mention dogs, cats, fish in the ponds, and all kinds of insects, big and small. The territory is pretty green and provides a lot of natural shade, saving you from sunburn. Massage in the Spa was good. The room we were in was pretty spacious and featured a beautiful view over one of the pools and a little ""chunk"" of the ocean. The food was good, and the selection was quite interesting, mixing local and more ""European-oriented"" cuisines in a balanced way.",positive

Hotel was busy proving to be popular with tourists. Highly recommend this hotel!",positive

"The hotel lobby is just breath taking, this hotel was chosen as a relaxation stop , which really did that, Our room was facing the sea in the first building what a super view we could hear the waves crashing on the shore, Had a great meal then went to listen to the saxophone player at the Bar he was superb what a talent, Their was also an artist selling his paintings so purchased 2 as it was his last night their .Breakfast was plentiful something for everyone , my son even managed a massage before we left. Thank you for the experience.",positive
"Amazing property with great amenities! I really liked the spaces and connection to the surrounding and the environment! Truely a Geoffrey Bawa’s Architectural masterpiece.

"The location right next to the big and almost empty beach was magnificent. The experience at the spa was great, Prima gave me one of the best massages I’ve ever had and you can tell she has a medical background.

"The Heritance Ahungalla Hotel is the place you need to visit, Absolutely the best hotel we have stayed in by far. We have two Children and whom experienced the Heritance with us and we’re so looked after from start to finish, with everything you would need from stunning nearby beaches, relaxing swimming pools mind blowing food rooms to die for and out of this world views. Every staff member at the Heritance Ahungalla are so friendly and efficient at what they do they really do make you feel the true Sri Lankan Experience. A special shoutout to the beautiful kind ladies in the reception and the very kind restaurant staff, they all treated our two daughters and us really well and that’s something special. The Heritance Ahungalla has everything you would need from the food which is not just a variety of cuisine from all over the world as well as traditional Sri Lankan dishes. The swimming pools are cleaned and sterile overnight ready for the next morning, the live music was a touch all of its own and a great thing to come across.",positive

I love this place for its beauty and architecture and have been coming here for years (the first time 30 years ago as it was my Sri Lankan father’s favourite) .

"A luxurious hotel on the shore of the Indian ocean. Imho, the contingent here is not very pleasant, someone turns on his music on the speaker while you listen to live music, someone tik-toki watching at full volume, and the staff does not care. Also, guides or some other people are constantly pestering on the beach and offering their overpriced services. You are just perceived as a money bag here.",negative

"Ich war 2 Wochen in diesem Hotel, nicht nur eine Nacht. Über Booking habe ich aber nur eine ""Überbrückungs-Nacht"" gebucht. Mit Vollpension. Die Lage des Hotels ist super. Der Strand am Hotel ist sehr schön. Ich hatte ein Zimmer mit direktem Meerblick, das teuerste Zimmer, was das Hotel anbietet. Es gibt nur wenige davon. Das war auch das Beste am Hotel. Das Essen war auch gut und lecker. Ich habe nur die Spezialitäten des Landes gegessen. Der Service beim Essen war gut. Das Personal immer sehr freundlich, trotzdem oft nicht aufmerksam obwohl Unmengen an Personal immer da war. Gut fand ich, dass es in der Hotelanlage immer sehr gutes WLan gab. Selbst bei starkem Regen gab es keine Probleme mit dem Internet.",positive

"Recently returned from a 2 week stay at Heritance. Had a great holiday. The hotel staff go out of their way to make your holiday enjoyable. As always with any holiday, there were things which were good and others that we felt could have been improved. The hotel is right on the beach and has lovely garden areas with plenty of available sunbeds. The pool staff are on hand to provide you with sunbed cushions and towels. They do, however, need to provide more sunshade umbrellas. Although the grounds have plenty of trees which can provide shade, having the flexibility of an umbrella would have been better. There are 2 pools, both well kept and maintained. One is quite busy because it’s nearer to the pool bar; the other is nice and quiet but still near enough to nip along for a cheeky cocktail! There are 2 restaurants on site - the buffet and a separate restaurant which AI guests had to pay for. However, when we enquired at reception about using this, we were told we couldn’t by one member of staff and then we could, by another staff member, but only at certain times, which were not our choice. It seemed a little strange, so for some variety we opted to go further down the beach to Jungle Beach restaurant a few nights, which had tables on the sand and a reasonably priced food and drinks menu. The AI list of drinks/cocktails at the hotel was fine for our tastes - about 8 cocktails to choose from and local spirits available. The bar staff were quite happy to top up the measures if that was requested. Just one odd thing though…the hotel provide tea time snacks at 4 pm (cakes, sandwiches etc) and I asked for a glass of wine to accompany the snacks, but was told that wine was only included in the buffet restaurant and I would have to pay at the bar. Again, a little strange. I couldn’t see the difference between wine in the restaurant and wine at the bar. The buffet food is quite spicy. There is a pizza station and a pasta station, but most other things have some element of spice in them. We just had the basic room, which was fine. Plenty of space. Bathroom not the biggest but adequate, with a rainfall shower. Towels were changed every day and the sheets every other day. The cleanliness of the room was spot on. We travelled with TUI and used them for the excursion to the Udawalawe National Park. Enjoyable, but a long day. Pick up at 4.40 am then quite a long drive (2 1/2 hours). Saw lots of elephants. We then headed off for lunch, which was very good. Sometimes on these trips the lunch is hardly edible. We were told beforehand that we would be given time to swim after lunch, but as the whole stop was just a hour, there wasn’t time to swim, which was disappointing. Then off to Galle. The trip, as they always do, included visits to local traders - wood carved elephants and moonstone mine/jewellery, which wasn't for us but obviously you have to go along, and then back to the hotel for 6 pm. A lot of the TUI experiences are far away so start with a long drive - Yala National Park, Kandy, so we opted for the one which was the closest. But, still a tiring day, albeit an enjoyable experience. There are local traders on the beach, who are always trying to catch the attention of the hotel guests. They mainly sell clothing and there is also a local trip provider, going to the same places as the ones which TUI go to. I asked the advice of the customer relations member of staff and she wouldn’t recommend as they wouldn’t have the same, if any, levels of insurance. But, obviously their prices are cheaper. We were disappointed in the weather. It was very warm every day but about 2 or 3 of the days were washed out so everyone headed for the inside areas. Out of 14 days, only about 5 were full sunshine. The others were overcast but as I said, still warm. We went to Thailand same time last year and had wall to wall sunshine. I know the weather is in God’s hands but people may prefer to know. Use the tuk tuks. We enjoyed grabbing one outside the hotel grounds and asking the driver to take us to various places. The driver will stay with you and only charge once you’re back at the hotel. The most we paid for a round trip was 1000 LKR (about £2.80). Visit the turtle sanctuary down the road and/or go for a river cruise on the Madu River. Overall, I would recommend staying at Heritance Ahungalla. The staff are fabulous and my slight quibbles re food and drink didn’t spoil the holiday.",positive
I was in hotel from 26 January 2025 up to 3 February 2025. staff is really friendly and always ready to help. Food is tasty. Spa services is really good and reasonable prices. Beach is clear. In few words satisfaction and relax!!! Hint: order box launches=),positive
"Before I came, I was planning this as a one off, knowing there are several places around the world I'd like to visit. Within 10 minutes of arrival, I knew I would be coming back as the happy smiling workers on reception and the cleanliness of the hotel The hotel is designed by the top Sri Lankan architect Geofrey Bawa and the first thing you see on arrival is the infinity pool. After staying here for a few days, it became clear the restaurant team are quite incredible. With so many people arriving from many countries around the world with so many food expectations and dietary requirements it was quite interesting for me to watch the waiters endlessly making sure everything ran smoothly. Mentioning the waiters, I must make mention of a very smart new trainee waiter called Thurlitha, who was being trained by Jacob, a very experienced waiter who I had the pleasure of watching from my corner watching all the incredible work the staff performed during my stay. The French style pastries, the wonderful pizzas included several Sri Lankan fish toppings and a Black Pork Pizza, something I had never heard of before. I'd tell everyone to come here, and come with a completely open mind. Yes, you can enjoy English food here if you need a roast lamb or roast beef with all the trimmings, but I like local food wherever I am, so happily tried a cheese hopper or red rice with vegetable curry served with mango and pineapple chutney. Best thing for me to start the morning with is with a cup of Ceylon tea and a puff pastry or two, if you are truly adventurous try a puff pastry filled with fish curry. I did, because I had never seen one before and just had to try one. I am so pleased I was in All Inclusive, that made it easy to keep tabs of the drink and extra food eaten round the pool. Glad there is a gym here, almost impossible to avoid putting a little bit of weight...! My room was spotless, and was so sorry to leave Heritance Beach Resort to return to the miserable cold weather of England. First thing I did back home was to get straight onto Tui to book another holiday in Sri Lanka at the same resort.",positive
"We spent our vacation here. The main goal was to stay at some peaceful place on the shore of the ocean to abstract from the noise and vibes of the city. And Heritance Ahungalla was the perfect choice for this. A great villa type hotel located on the front line of the ocean surrounded by palms and vibrant plants. The room was comfortable and clean, with all standard amenities. Two great swimming pools on the territory. Food was tasty and variable. Special thanks to one of the supervisor guys Chamuditha who was super helpful and made our stay very comfortable.",positive
I highly recommend hotel heritance ahungalla.The staff were good welcoming and friendly.The room was very comfortable and very spacious.Specially it had very beautiful sea view. Food was very tasty and good looking special thanks for executive chef Lakmal. Overall hospitality was incredible.,positive
We had a memorable stay with good service by all the Staff. The food was amazing with a wide varity.. The guided tour by the hotel staff on request to know about Architect Geoferry Bawa was conducted very nicely explaining a lot of details. Thr rooms are very clean. We had a good time at thr pool and the bar loungr listening to the luve music.,positive
"At the beginning of last year 2024, we planned to take a vacation in a sunny location. I live in Belgium and here almost all year round the weather is cloudy and often rainy with very few sunny days during the year. We decided to celebrate the beginning of the new year in a sunny location by the ocean, I decided on Sri Lanka.I had a choice between Riu Hotel or Heritance Ahungalla from the Ahungalla region, Bentota. During December the weather is very hot in this region with few days or hours of rain.We hit the jackpot and fate decided Heritance Ahungalla ... the best decision of fate. A great location, a very friendly staff, a clean and very well-kept hotel, a restaurant with a rich and varied assortment for all demanding people, prepared meals for the new year 2025 left me speechless.I'm very sorry that I can't remember the names of the staff, but thank you: the restaurant manager, the reception manager, the waiters and waitresses, the cooks, the assistant cooks and the chefs, the cleaning staff, the bar staff, the pool staff.All of you together made us a wonderful vacation and we really felt at home. We definitely plan to come back. Thanks for everything,from Belgium ps:maybe someone remeber us ;)",positive
"Room was decent, nothing fancy. Beachfront was nothing to die for. There are so many better beaches in southern coastline of Sri Lanka. The let down was how the hotel staff discriminate between dark skin people and white skin people. Initially I thought it was a mistake, then a coincidence when differential treatment continued and then understood it is a systemic issue in this facility. All 3 of us had experiences that we can relate to. Also, they make you wear a wrist band during your stay: reminds me of a hospital admission. Perhaps, they cannot remember that you are a hotel guest without having the band.",neutral
"The pool was very nice and I loved how I could go to the beach every day. The views are beautiful and the rooms are excellent. Room service is great too. Comfy bed, nothing to complain about. Very wide variety of delicious breakfast foods. Had a great time with my family. You need to come here!!!",positive
"Jayaru and all staff were excellent- very helpful and friendly. Massage was great, room was comfy, food was good. The selection of local food and western food was good. The beach was clean and not crowded. Swimming at sunset was a bonus. Thanks Heritance!",positive
"The hotel is huge, rooms are big and there are never queues. Pools are good and the pool boys also nice. The housekeeping staff, especially Rukmal is amazing. Downside; The hotel has terrible price policy. You need to pay for everything + 18% and extra service charge. The prices are huge and complexity unfair. This is the reason why I will not return here.",negative
"We visited Heritance Ahungalla during a family reunion - 21 of us. We found the staff very friendly, service excellent. It is a property right on the beach, and beautifully designed to add to the experience. Their head office had not communicated our booking to the hotel. This resulted in a little delay in getting us into our rooms, but the hotel staff managed this issue well. The wide variety of western and Sri Lankan food were available. The tastes did not disappoint. Great job chef. All in all, a great experience. I will recommend Heritance Ahungalla to my friends. Thanks.",positive
we had a fantastic family holiday. lovely ocean for swimming. Big swimming pool. The food was great with great service. The rooms were clean and well appointed. Plenty of space to hang out play games. Nice spa service too. Happy to recommend this hotel for a holiday in Sri Lanka,positive
"This hotel has provided a very relaxing experience for our family. All the staff is very friendly, helpful, and respectful. Spacious rooms, great amenities and food. We only went for the breakfast option but you can opt for all inclusive. Rich choice for breakfast and very delicious and fresh. They have lots of fun activities planned for each day and live music in the evenings. We were lucky enough to celebrate new years at Heritance hotel as they put together a beautiful New Year’s Eve gala dinner. Big variety of food options and all delicious they also had a band. At midnight they had fireworks set off creating a magical atmosphere.",positive
Food and service was extremely Good. Chef balbirsingh had served us jain food & the taste was extremely amazing. Pure veg Jain food highly recommended by Chef. Hotel is also fantastic Location is really nice I highly recommend all to go visit. Thankyou..,positive
"I recently stayed at Heritance Ahungalla, and it was a fantastic experience! The rooms were spacious and offered a spectacular view of the ocean from the balcony, a great beach and swimming pool, all of which were truly breathtaking. The staff was extremely cooperative and went out of their way to ensure we had a comfortable stay. Traveling with two young kids can be challenging, but their attentiveness made all the difference. While the restaurant didn't have many vegetarian options on the menu, the chef, Balbeer Singh, went above and beyond to prepare delicious vegetarian meals for us and our kids throughout our stay. This thoughtful gesture truly enhanced our experience and made us feel valued. I highly recommend Heritance Ahungalla for families looking for a relaxing and welcoming getaway. We look forward to visiting again!",positive

"**Google Review for Heritance Ahungalla** Heritance Ahungalla is a stunning resort with a private beach and well-maintained pools. The rooms are neat, and the overall environment is clean and family-friendly. It’s a great place for a vacation with kids. However, the service leaves much to be desired. At check-in, the front desk staff greet you warmly and create an impression of excellent service, but the actual intention to help seems to be lacking. We traveled as two families and requested rooms close to each other. The staff promised to accommodate us the next day, but despite multiple follow-ups, no one informed us why it wasn’t arranged. Additionally, there were several service lapses: - When we reported non-functional TV services, no one responded. - An emergency housekeeping request was ignored until we followed up repeatedly every 30 minutes. - A simple request for bananas for a child after the paid breakfast buffet had closed was also ignored, with staff disappearing without fulfilling the request. While the staff are polite and pleasant in interactions, their inability to provide timely and reliable service is disappointing for a five-star resort. Compared to the service at The Kingsbury Colombo, Heritance Ahungalla falls significantly short. Overall, a beautiful property with potential, but the service experience needs serious improvement to match its five-star rating.",neutral
"Great hotel. Clean, very friendly staff especially Visal (jake) Rebecca,nelka,chinthaka,Ealing and the pool attendants very attentive and pleasant, all the staff go out if their way to make sure you have everything you need Felt upset when leaving will definitely go back.",positive

Beautiful location on the beach and 2 pools with plenty of shade. Staff were wonderful and extremely helpful. There was a good choice of options for eating at the hotel which was fortuitous because there wasn’t really anywhere local to eat. Customer relations were great when we had an issue with our fan and fridge and also assisted us with booking a boat safari.,positive
"Lovely hotel, but remote location. Great rooms, large, comfy and cool. Good functional bathrooms. Staff are lovely, very friendly. Music at night is both entertaining and WAY too loud. Options outside the hotel are limited unless you want to travel miles. No local restaurants or bars for example. Swimming pools are to die for, plenty of beds and space for all. Nice overhanging trees for shade. Location on beach is lovely, sea very rough when we were there.",positive
"Heritance Ahungalla was an incredible experience! A special thanks to Jayaru, the Guest Relations Executive, for her warm and friendly service. She made sure everything was perfect during my stay. The food was fresh and delicious, with plenty of options to enjoy. The pool was beautiful and a great place to relax while taking in the stunning ocean views. The rooms were clean, spacious, and super comfortable. The whole place had such a peaceful vibe. I’d highly recommend this hotel and can’t wait to visit again!",positive
Thank you so much. Everything was nice food and view We would love to came again next time visit Sri Lanka. If you book this hotel you can stay hole day and chilling. Massage was also nice when you visit here you should try it. And bar was also nice I had cake and cocktails:) Chamuditha bar supervisor very good.,positive

One of the best places in down south to enjoy a dayout. One of the friendliest staffs. The buffet has a variety of food items and the sea food are super delicious. They allowed early check-ins and late check -outs. Nothing to say as a bad review.,positive
"Old, noisy, really commercial hotel with huge buffets. Everything could use a fresh painting and cleaning. Staff is not really customer minded. No special efforts are made or extra smile. If you look foor cosiness, it’s not the place😞😞😞",negative
"We ended our trip around Sri Lanka with a 4 night stay at this hotel. Despite a few hiccups accessing one of our hotel rooms doors daily, we had a pleasant stay. Although some of the trainee staff on reception lacked enthusiasm the rest of the hotel staff were friendly and hospitable. Special mentions to the housekeeping team, the restaurant staff, particularly Waranu, who went above and beyond during our meals and even got one of the chefs to write down a recipe for us. Also thanks to Rebecca and the pool bar team and Jayaru who always welcomed us with a smile and was happy to show us the hotel amenities.",positive
"Disappointing Dining Experience at Ahungalla Heritance I had high expectations when visiting Ahungalla Heritance (part of the Aitken Spence chain), but the food quality was a major disappointment. The lunch buffet was underwhelming, with most dishes lacking salt and flavor. The fried rice, made with samba rice, was a poor choice and didn’t complement the rest of the dishes at all. Tea-time snacks were no better—minimal variety and nothing appetizing or memorable. We even raised our concerns with the chefs, but unfortunately, there was no noticeable improvement. For a reputed hotel chain, the dining experience was far below standard. I hope the management takes this feedback seriously and works on upgrading their food quality and variety.",negative
"If you’re looking for the perfect getaway, Heritance Ahungalla is the ultimate destination. This 5-star resort delivers an exceptional experience in every aspect – from its stunning location to its warm and attentive service. The staff are truly outstanding. Their friendliness and professionalism make you feel right at home from the moment you arrive. Whether it’s at check-in, the restaurants, or by the pool, they go above and beyond to ensure your stay is unforgettable. The food is simply divine, offering a wide variety of dishes that cater to every palate. From authentic local Sri Lankan cuisine to international delights, every meal feels like a gourmet experience. The resort’s location is breathtaking, set against a backdrop of serene beaches and lush greenery. The well-maintained grounds, infinity pools, and proximity to nature make it an ideal spot to relax and unwind. Heritance Ahungalla is more than just a resort – it’s an experience. Whether you’re traveling for a romantic escape, a family vacation, or just some time to yourself, this place will leave you longing to return. Highly recommended!",positive

The room itself was really clean and comfortable, everything we needed was there and room service was really good too! Highly recommend and will come back if we visit again!!",positive
Highly recommend this place The experience and the ambience at Heritance was amazing. We as a couples state here for 7 days. The best part about the property is that it has a direct beach access. The beaches are clean and less crowded. The hotels staff is very polite and warm. Thank you for your courteous upgrade to a suite. The restore manager Mr Pradeep was very kind and understanding of our needs as we are vegetarian. The soothing sound of the waves is the best part of the resort.,positive

"This beautiful hotel is perfectly located on the beach with a great swimming pool just behind. This stay has been something that we looked forward to when we were planning our honeymoon.

Without a doubt, this gorgeous hotel exceeded our expectations, leaving us with cherished memories that we'll forever hold. Highly recommend for couples seeking an intimate and memorable getaway.",positive
This was the last stop on a busy 2-week Group Tour of Sri Lanka. It was our least favourite hotel. It looks tired in places. We had a spacious ground floor room with a small triangular shaped bathroom. The shower doors looked in need of a good clean. Our patio doors we discovered hadn't been locked properly so anyone could have pushed them open. In the early hours of the first morning we heard 2 distinctive taps on the patio doors which was unnerving. We didn't get up to investigate but whilst the hotel is behind gates and security at the front it seemed to me that there was nothing stopping anyone wandering in off the beach area. This hotel is very popular with locals especially at weekends so when we arrived the hotel was packed with a large group of young men playing volleyball in the main pool. All sunbeds were taken by families sitting round chatting. As this was the only day of R & R part on our trip it was a bit concerning but by Sunday afternoon things had quietened down. This is a very large busy hotel so breakfast was a bun fight and it took us 10-15 minutes to get served tea or coffee. Nice outside seating area by one of the bars. As you are nearer Colombo you will get pestered on the beach to buy things. The sea was too rough to swim in and there are dangerous rip tides. There is nothing to do locally but we did visit the Victor Hasselblad Sea Turtle Research And Conservation Centre just 3 miles up the road. Well worth an hour's visit to see the wonderful work they are doing. None of the multiple hotel staff hanging around reception had heard of it even though it is literally up the same road. But a taxi driver Googled it for us and took us there and back. The Hotel is off one busy road with shops and other Hotels but not in a specially pretty area. This area was impacted by the tsunami so you will see little graveyards and monuments in memory of people who lost their lives. Especially on the train that got swept off the track.,positive
Thanks to Heritance Ahungalla team for doing everything for guests. The view from our room was amazing. Food very tasty. Perfect service. All employees were very kindly. Special thanks to bar supervisor Chamuditha organising for us romantic seafood-dinner.,positive
Staying Experian here is very good. Room services are in time and staff is very friendly. Everyday activities keep your fun on during the stay. Food test good and chef BALBEER SINGH had provided us very much homely test. Thanks to Mr.Singh we had really great experience in food.,positive
"The time here was great and specially during night. Everyone here was passionate and swift at what they did. When i was here it was the 31st of october, they went all out to celebrate halloween and brought that spirit to life as most other places in sri lanka doesnt consider it as a holiday. Also special thanks to Duminda and his colleagues for the help.",positive
"Beautiful sea and gorgeous largest pool. The hotel staff are good and thank you especially to Chamuditha the Kitchen Supervisor who looked after us, helped us and so friendly and helpful. He makes the hotel a much better place!! We have loved Sri Lanka and the hotel really made a massive effort for Halloween for those that like the celebrations.",positive
"A fabulous hotel with architecture built to incorporate original trees. The open, internal courtyards with trees and creepers give a welcoming and airy feel. Collectively the hotel boasts some of the friendliest staff we have encountered on our travels. From Hashini greeting us at every trip to the restaurant; Chamuditha supervising the restaurant team and sharing top tips for where to visit and the best time of day to go; and Dilan who kept our room spotless. And to the many we haven't specifically called out, you didn't go unnoticed!!! Our stay spanned Halloween and we were treated to a restaurant night that went all in. From costumes to decorations and desserts. What a treat!! Would highly recommend to anyone wanting to stay on the west coast of Sri Lanka.",positive
My stay at the Heritance Ahungalla was absolutely amazing the food and my room were exceptional. The staff were very friendly and accommodating from the moment i arrived and went above and beyond to make me feel a valued customer throughout my stay. I would highly recommend this hotel and i am looking forward to my next visit.,positive
"I had a quick 2 Nights stay at Heritance Ahungalla in October during my recent trip to Srilanka. This resort is in quiant town of Ahungalla which is roughly 2 hrs drive from Colombo Airport. Though the entrance to the resort is bang on main road, the rooms and overall facilities of the resort are tucked away in quite zone away from the main road. The resort has choice of rooms with Garden View, Pool View and Sea View. All the rooms have a sit out or balcony. All other facilities needed for relaxing holiday like Restaurants, Gym, Games Centre, Swimming Pool, SPA is available at the resort. The rooms at the resort are of decent size with comfortable and functional bathroom. The upkeep of the rooms and overall resort, facilities are top notch. The staff at resort are welcoming and helpful to your requests. The resorts direct access to the beach is added bonus with the beach being quiet scheduled and more or less being private to In House Guests. For Dining options the resort has their Main Restaurant which offers Buffet & Al Carte options apart from Pool Bar and Speciality Restaurants too. The Breakfast buffet is sumptuous with vide variety of food ranging from Local Srilankan to international cusine. The Vegetarians options for breakfast don't disappoint either with plenty of options from Local Srilankan, Indian & Continental Cuisine to choose from. The taste and quality of food served at breakfast is equally of high standard . For Lunch or Dinner you can choose to go with Buffet or Al Carte. The prices for dishes in Al Carte is quite reasonable with decent choice for Vegetarians too. I had my dinner at their all day dining restaurant and surprisingly the Indian Chef dished out simple yet delicious Indian Fare. I would like to extend my appreciation for the Chef Mr.Balbeer Singh who was quite accommodative and helpful in suggesting the food choice considering we were vegetarian. If you are craving for Indian Food at this resort then don't hesitate to reach out to Chef Balbeer Singh who will at your service with great suggestions. Thanks Chef for all your help and support during our stay at Heritance Ahungalla. Keep doing the good work. From Excursion or Sightseeing Point Heritance Ahungalla is reasonably placed from key sightseeing places like Galle, Bentota, Hikkaduwa etc; Most of these places are under 30-60 minutes drive from resort. I throughly enjoyed my stay at Heritance Ahungalla and will definitely look forward to staying at Heritance Ahungalla the next time I am in Srilanka. A big shout out and sincere appreciation to all the people behind the scenes at the resort who are going the extra mile to keep the guests comfortable and happy.",positive

Chef Balbeer Singh took really good care of us and he is an amazing cook too. As i am a vegetarian he personally took good care of my meals. Worth staying place.",positive
"Our stay at heritance ahungalla was nothing short or amazing... the food, comfort, familiarity and staff was very warm.the hotel truly captures the nature at its very best form and delivers utmost luxury to its occupants.... Would recommend 11/10... cant wait to come back next time!",positive
"I had two amazing days with my girlfriend in Heritance Ahungalla, and we couldn't have asked for more! The hotel has an amazing beachfront setting with beautiful views of the Indian Ocean. The staff was very friendly and accommodating from the moment we arrived, and they went above and beyond to make us feel valued during our visit. With a private balcony facing the ocean, our accommodation was airy, contemporary, and spotlessly clean, making it the ideal place to watch the sunset. The cuisine was yet another highlight; there was an amazing array of delicacies from around the world and locally, at the buffet. The most romantic part of our trip was the candlelit dinner by the ocean. The infinity pool was also a hit with us; it was like being in a tropical paradise. The grounds were nicely manicured, and we relished quiet",positive
"The hotel although at first sight seemed a little shabby in places, turned out to be one of the best places we have ever stayed, it has a certain unique charm all of its own..The staff were all incredibly friendly and attentive. The food was lovely and lots to choose from. The pools were nice, one more for families, the other quieter. Always sunbeds available. Nice low key entertainment. We enjoyed it so much, we have booked again...",positive
"Amazing hospitality. Great locality. Staff was very good. Clean pool, great resort atmosphere. Located well with all amenities. Had a great experience living there. Live music is played every evening by good well known bands. Drinks were also affordable.",positive
"Our last visit to this wonderful hotel was in 2022. We have also been coming since the early 2000’s too. We had a very nice suite on the 3rd level, overlooking the main pool and near the main restaurant. Despite the rainy weather and rough seas in October, we had a great time. Food (as buffet menu) was fantastic, staff were very helpful. Any little issues we’re dealt with professionally and quickly. We would like to thank all the staff we had contact with. Special thanks go to Ms Jayaru in Customer Relations, Chaminda in housekeeping, Ms Hasini and Duminda (who remembered us from 2022) in the main restaurant. They were able to reserve a table by the window we liked. A very enjoyable stay and a place we would recommend.",positive
"We had a great experience there. The staff and service was superb. The pool is open until 8pm. There was an indoor games area and library. I loved those places to spend the time. The rooms were clean and had a good bathroom. One of the best hotels in Sri lanka which provides great safety. but didn't have a nice view. If you are a sea food lover, you must visit this hotel. Crab, prawn, cuttlefish and many more seafood things in one place. Never experienced such a thing before. They had a good buffet with a lot of varieties and they served tasty foods. But only a few items were delicious. I experienced that drawback from this kind of bigger buffets serving hotels. Live music nights and a lot of services available through the hotel. I believe it was an amazing visit to Heritance Ahungalla.",neutral
"One of Sri Lanka's top hotels. We stayed here for two nights, and we were glad that we chose this hotel because it has everything a visitor could want. The staff was attentive and kind. Their faces were bright with smiles as they greeted us. When you first meet someone, they all smile. The bathrooms and rooms were roomy, tidy, and cozy. From the room, you have a great view of the ocean. The food was delicious and well-dispersed. Their cocktails were excellent. All in all, my visit to Heritance Ahungalla was fantastic. We would not hesitate to suggest this hotel and would gladly return.",positive
"Heritance Ahungalla staff went above and beyond to ensure our stay was comfortable and enjoyable, thank you team front office and all. The view fantastic and perfect place to stay with groups, place is relax and Excellent, and the resort architecture is stunning and room views Excellent, we will comeback",positive
"This is my first time in Sri Lanka. This warm welcome from the hotel staff just made my day. Everything was perfect and well maintained hotel with nice employees. Food is excellent and just right place to spend your time in South of Sri Lanka. Activities near by good for every member of your family. .. Just one tip for the beach area, avoid any plastic trash. I did collect few of them. Thank you!",positive
"Excellent service. Live music by the pool at night and The staff went above and beyond in their efforts. Loved our stay we enjoyed the ocean and the swimming pool very much. Staff was amazing and the breakfast buffet had variety of options. Rooms were comfortable and had a big balcony facing the ocean , it was lovely to wake up in the morning to that view. Price we paid was reasonable for the quality of service we received.",positive
"Very nice hotel. Well situated on the beach. 2 gorgeous large swimming pools, clean and clear. The food was excellent with a tremendous variety of fish and seafood cooked to perfection. Nightly live music. Nice poolside bar that made excellent drinks. Staff were friendly and professional. Highly recommend",positive
"I recently stayed at Heritance Ahungalla and it was a impressive and comfortable stay! The staff were friendly and welcoming. The hotel is designed by Deshamanya Jeoffery Bawa and is wonderful in all sense. The vastness and aesthetics of the property, the breathtaking views of the pool, beach and the surroundings from the moment you enter the hotel. It is definitely an experience. The salt in the air singes your nose in the best way possible. They have tried to upkeep the original architecture of the building from the 1980's as much as possible and it is pleasant on the eyes. The breakfast buffet was decent and had south Indian options. The breakfast buffet had alot of options and varieties, however, the taste of the food did slightly fall behind for the price paid and for what was expected. This also applies to their Dinner buffet. On the other hand, the room service menu though very limited has tasty and reasonably priced options (special mention to the nasi goreng, which was delicious with a good portion size). A special note on the very wonderful welcome we recieved at the property. The cold towel and the welcome drink was refreshing and the staff are very very polite and willing to help you with anything. Me and my wife, we stayed in the 'luxury room' category of rooms. The room was pleasant and spacious with 'L' shaped balcony access. The views from the balcony did not bore us throughout our stay, breathtaking every single time. We just stayed at the property and enjoyed the property itself. However, travelling to nearby locations such an Lunuganga, Bentota river sports, etc should not be an issue at all, as the property is very accessible by uber/pickme. However, despite the food being okay, it's better to opt for full board or atleast half board as there are not many options for restaurants nearby. I highly recommend the hotel to anyone seeking to have a relaxing vacation on the beach while enjoying a piece of Bawa architecture. Rating Breakdown: - Cleanliness: 5/5 - Service: 4/5 - Value: 4.5/5 - Location: 5/5 - Sleep Quality: 5/5",positive
"It was a pleasure staying at this hotel. Heritance is a nice hotel with excellent food and service. Breakfast, Lunch & Dinner are good and you can choose: Indian, Asian, etc. Also the restaurant is very good. Overall the experience was brilliant and enjoyed business getaway a lot. I will definitely stay here again.",positive
"My wife and I spent two amazing nights with our cousin Nishanthi and Savi who took us to Heritance Ahungalle on the start of our vacation in Srilanka. The hospitality and friendliness of the staff was evident from the moment we stepped in to the lobby. our room on the 3rd floor overlooking the Indian ocean was spectacular. the room was very spacious and comfortable. The balcony outside the room afforded us time to read and relax in the evening.the bathroom was very clean and had ample counter space to keep our toiletries. I must make special mention of the unbelievable spread at each if the buffet meals. We arrived just in time for the lunch buffet Starting with soup to salads to Srilankan Indian Chinese and western dishes the spread was enormous. The dessert menu too was too numerous to mention. The dinner and breakfast menus were excellent with the gourmet spread to cover every pallet needs. We must make special mention of Mr. Pradeep Guneratne the FnB Executive who ensured our stay was memorable, Being a long weekend in Srilanka the hotel was at its capacity. Pradeep and his staff ensured that the guests were seated with the minimum wait times. Pradeep surprised us with a special dish of Srilankan crab curry Coconut sambol and roast bread which truly was a delicacy we had not had in years. Thank you Nishanthi and Savi for choosing Heritance Ahungalle to host us for a relaxing stay, our sincere appreciation to Pradeep and staff at Heritance for the comfortable stay and providing us a great culinary experience.",positive

"We stayed for three nights at the Heritance Ahungalla hotel, which is beautifully located facing the coast and close to the main road. The hotel maintains a clean and pleasant environment. Although the property is a bit older, the rooms have been renovated and are extremely clean. The staff is courteous and helpful. A special mention to the Assistant Resort Manager, Mr. Rasika, who made our stay even more enjoyable. He personally spoke to the guests and ensured we had a pleasant experience. When I fell ill, Mr. Rasika was exceptionally helpful and took personal care of my needs, which I truly appreciated. The food was excellent, offering a good variety of Sri Lankan and international cuisines, all of which were delicious. The swimming pool was well-maintained and clean, and the poolside bar staff provided great service. Overall, it was a delightful stay, and we look forward to visiting again.",positive

Beautiful pools with easy access to the beach. Thank you Heritance Ahungalla!",positive
"This has been a wonderful & truly relaxing experience. I was looking forward to having some downtime when this stay was booked. I feel completely rejuvenated. The staff could not be more attentive, kind & professional. Despite the size of the hotel, it still has a homely feeling because of the care & consideration given by the staff. All of our requests were accommodated where possible. I would definitely recommend staying here, whether for relaxation or a family holiday. The food is 11/10 (!) - a mix of western & Eastern options. There is live music in the lounge area, games & two swimming pools both facing the sea. Absolutely heavenly.",positive
"Lovely hotel with friendly and attentive staff, epitomising Sri Lankan warmth and hospitality. Beautiful beach and poolside setting, which was perfect for kids.

"Heritance Ahungalla is really a lovely place to visit with a marvelous architecture and a beautiful beach. Though our stay was short we enjoyed a lot ,as there were a lot of extra activities indoors and outdoors as well. Rooms were very clean ,buffet meals offered were delicious with so many verities to choose as two in our family were vegetarians.,most of all what I loved was the way the whole team at Heritance had prepared our room and organised a small birthday party as we visited the hotel intending to celebrate my birthday....special thanks to Restaurant manager Mr.Duminda and his extraordinary, workaholic team who worked throughout tirelessly to make all the guests a memorable unforgettable stay. Thank you once again for making our visit feel joyous and memorable.",positive

So thank you for everything you have prepared to make our evening beautiful. Again, it's great. Thank you Navidu. Good work See you again.",positive
"The hotel allocated a twin room when we booked a double, so it was not a good start. After waiting for about 2 hours, we were relocated to a suite which was rewarding and made the stay pleasant and enjoyable. The Bawa suite is par excellence. Had all amenities we wanted. Bed was comfortable. Had its own large private balcony. It was perfect.",positive

Will surely visit again.",positive
"When I married in 2013, we went on our honeymoon to Heritance Ahungalla. It was one of the best hotels we have been to, and I speak about the experience (fantastic food, very kind staff, excellent service, super and well-maintained facilities). This year, after 11 years, we decided to take our two kids to Heritance Ahungalla. Every hotel we have visited since we got married has used Heritance as the benchmark. I was reluctant to visit Heritance again because I didn't want the high standards we had set to be lowered. To my amazement, after 11 years, it's still the same. The food—every dish was super yam—the staff is very kind, and the facilities are still well maintained—I am still amazed. Funny story, today when house keeping came to clean the room, they noticed that my kids had brought their favorite toy with them to sleep with. Before they left, they had kept my kids' stuff in the bed; when we came to the room, my kids were so happy to see that. Small things do matter, very kind staff service.",positive
"The property is a great one. The hotel is located by the beach with one of the best views. Had a pleasant stay with my family. Special shout out to Chef Balbeer Singh, he took special care of us and went out of his way to cater to our food requirements. And not to mention, the taste was amazing(veg/non veg both).",positive
"The Heritance has a good reputation amongst locals and travel agents. Whilst we did have a lovely stay, we didn’t feel it was on par with 5* hotels we have stayed in other countries or even in line with the other six 5*’s we stayed in Sri Lanka as part of a touring holiday with beach relaxation at the end. Pro’s: - nice hotel with minimalist design. - smaller and more intimate then the Riu which is located next door - very friendly staff - pool area opens onto beach and you can walk easily - quite location - restaurants food was great and there was plenty of good quality variety. - the hotel was not busy and we were often the only ones in the pool which was great. - although in July the sea is too rough to swim in, the beach was lovely to walk and play on. Con’s: - although in mostly good condition, we felt it was dated in parts - although we Stayed in a suite we didn’t feel the hotel was luxury, the rooms could’ve done with a bit more soft furnishings to make it feel a bit more luxurious. - suite bathroom only has a large bath with over shower. There is a step into the bath which may be an issue for those with mobility issues. - there is limited number of poolside sun umbrellas which seemed a shame as umbrellas, poolside service etc, we would deem as basics. We had to tip to ensure we got an umbrella reach day which we felt should not have been necessary given it was a 5*. On our first day we were told a couple who had 2 sun-loungers, 2 umbrellas and a spot looking out to the beach and sea were “VIPs” and there were no more umbrellas. We did find a more helpful attendant the next day however. - evening entertainment a bit hit and miss. - could put some sun-loungers on the beach for hotel guests. Overall, a lovely hotel and we would definately stay again however request the hotel take on some of our suggestions.",positive
The entrance is very cozy...check in was smooth...welcome drinks were uniquely served...room was spacious with all required amenities...the swimming pool and the beach view was just amazing...Staffs always smiling was very good....in-house buffet dinner and breakfast were amazing with multiple options to choose from...highly recommended.,positive
Friendly welcome. The buffet brilliant with absolutely delicious hoppers made by a lovely lady! Only pain was when we had to wait long for a cup of tea in the morning. House keeping did a beautiful job making the room with a lovely touch of arranging my sons Teddy with a elephant made with a towel! Thank you Rukmal,positive
"We had a wonderful visit. Food was amazing and menu was fabulous with different meals both morning and evening over the course of seven days. A lot of variety the pool was great. There are two pools one more for family fun and the other more for relaxation and more quiet. Both are very large and well-maintained, the service was incredible and everybody was very friendly and helpful. We were definitely go again.",positive
"good hospitality, food and beach to swim at. Hotel room was clean and spacious. Staff are very friendly and helpful, always ready to help. Perfect place for a family holiday! Heritance has always maintained itself up to very high standards and is worth revisiting.",positive
"Ahungalla is my father’s hometown, and I’ve always wanted to stay at this hotel since childhood. My wife and I really enjoyed the day we spent at the hotel on our anniversary. The staff were very friendly, especially Jananjaya from Induruwa at the restaurant, who was very supportive and provided excellent service. He made sure we received a complimentary cake for our anniversary by informing all the relevant parties after realizing we didn’t get one. The room was very clean, and the food was delicious with many varieties",positive

"Beautiful beachfront hotel designed by Sri Lanka’s revered architect Geoffrey Bawa. While large as a property, the outside-in open corridors with trees and hanging plants don’t feel overwhelming and there’s a real sense of space and tranquility. Rooms are well appointed but the real highlights are the pools. the open and empty beachside views and, in particular, the friendly staff and the star of the show, the food. Breakfast is a feast of flavours, with more cooking stations than I’ve seen in a while. We were lucky enough to experience the Chef’s Table, which is an opportunity not only to cook in the professional kitchens (where a staff of 70 work) but to done there with the wonderful Executive Sous Chef Lakmal Chathuranga. So thrilling to have a ringside seat while the team delivered evening service. We assisted two terrific chefs in preparing a Sri Lankan feast of flavours - prawns, black chicken, tempered rice, dhal and eggplant dishes, which we then ate in the company of the Head Chef, himself a seasoned international culinary veteran. They do say if you want a real sense of a hotel, visit the kitchen. Would thoroughly recommend this at the Heritance Ahungalla, as well as a stay in this little slice of paradise hotel.",positive
"I love this place .. because of hospitality, all staff are polite and willing to help.. they always making sure that the guests are happy .. the food is delicious and includes a lot of dishes which satisfy all .. the sea view is Georgious specially the sunset.. highly recommended to be visited ..",positive
"The hotel is the best you can get in Bentota. The property is very huge and spacious. Though the property is a little bit far, it is definitely worth visiting. The food was very good with a huge spread. The staff was very cordial and helpful. In conclusion, the resort is worth a visit.",positive
"A must visit place it is, and special Thanks to Chef Balbir Singh. We were already in Sri Lanka for 15 days and finding good Indian food and he did the best and served us with Amazing food. Thank you so much to the entire staff of Heritance. Such a hidden gem it is. And definitely coming back soon.",positive
"Another well- spent vacation in Heritance Ahungalla for 7th time … salute to the amazing staff specially Ms . Trilishiya and Ms.Dilsha who cooperate to make us more and more comfort by going over and beyond . Love that wonderful place , delicious food and high quality service . Highly recommend",positive
"Very comfortable beds. Slept easily. Buffet had a great spread and very clean. The pool was well clean. The staff was very friendly and made us feel like home. Tasty food good spread of meat and vegetables. Good selection of indoor games. Overall, everything felt at ease and made us feel at home and calm",positive
"First trip to Sri Lanka and booked Heritance Ahungalla through a travel app after reading reviews and the competitive price. How to get there from Columbo Airport - It is about 2.5 hours depending on traffic and approximately $125 AUD. Authorities clearly wanting to enhance tourist confidence because there are approved operator (taxi) booths at the airport. You pay at the booth by zone (ultimate destination) and get a ticket. The staff member then takes you to a taxi and there is no further payment required. This actually put us at ease because we’ve all had horror taxi stories. Arrival at Heritance - This is a very positive experience. You are welcomed with refreshments, a friendly smile and seamlessly checked in. If you are used to doing everything yourself then you will have to give that habit away because the lovely staff will do everything. The resort is an old building which has been modernised so it has wide open corridors and the rooms are spacious. The rooms are clean and have balconies. Tv has a range of channels and the bathroom is good quality and clean. We were so pleased that the shower had a hose in addition to fixed shower head. Pool - absolutely no complaints. It is so clean and the pool guy is on top over it all. The staff are well trained and switched on. They wait until you look like you’ve found a spot to sit then bring the cushions and towels and then let you relax. You don’t need to leave the pool, food and drinks are well priced. For example, two club sandwiches, with chips and side salads, plus two cocktails and a wine was about $50 AUD. We thought that was competitive compared to other resorts we’ve stayed (albeit not in Sri Lanka) Beach - The beach is sandy but we did not not swim because our travel is in the monsoon season and sea is rough. We didn’t feel we were missing much because the pool area was so good. Food - there’s a reasonably priced cafe with lots of options. They will actually make what ever you need work and are very flexible. There’s a pool bar and the Buffet is brilliant. With the exception of one night we ate at the buffet every evening. We were very impressed by it. There is lots of cultural options. The Resort must also analyze client origins because a few days had a lot of Taiwan guests and we took advantage of the special menu that the resort created for them. We had gluten free requirements and this was easily accommodated. Taxi/tours - We appreciated that Heritance obviously have taxi/tour companies they have a relationship with because only a select few can operate from the Resort. We used Dhammika as our driver for day trips. All prices are transparently available so you know costs up front and can compare. We found him extremely knowledgeable and spoke good English. He was trustworthy and very accomodating. The day trip with him including a boat safari was a highlight. I’d recommend asking for him as a driver. Staff - The staff are standouts. They are clearly well trained and their professionalism is indicative of good culture and leadership within the Resort. I can’t speak highly enough. Our late checkout was accommodated even though they were extremely busy. Gym - I used this 4 times during our stay. It is adequately equipped, clean and tidy and the air conditioner was a blessing whilst running on the treadmill. I would recommend this resort if your stay is south of Colombo.",positive
"Beautiful facility with lot of character county’s most famous architect Geoffrey Bava’s design , was evident every where incorporating surrounding natural elements .. it’s supposedly 43 years old must say very well maintained. Yes the amenities ( light switches, central air conditioning and the airflow may be slightly dated but the promptness of the staff addressing any issues went well beyond what guest expected.. the beach early morning before the hot sun descends was very peaceful and refreshing., all in all if you want a purely relaxing vacation and not expecting to party at near by bar or wanting to do water sports ( water skating, speed boating ect ) this hotel checks all the boxes … food ( buffet) was good- catering to the palates of guests present .",positive
The stay in the Hotel was amazing and the best part was the Chef Mr. Balbir Singh. We were already 5 days in Srilanka and searching for good North Indian food. Mr. Balbir on our request specially added North Indian delicacies. Thank you so much for wonderful memories. My recommendations for anyone traveling Srilanka to stay in this property and eat Chef's choice menu 👍🏻,positive
"Absolutely incredible experience! The variety of delicious food was astounding, offering a delightful array of flavors for every meal. The hospitality was exceptional, making us feel warmly welcomed and pampered throughout our stay.

Great hotel and lovely staff . Special thanks to DILSHA ( Guest Relations Manager) excellent customer service and interaction with the guest . From our visit I can see that she does go the extra mile to help customers and accommodate. I believe she is a true asset to this hotel and should be recognised and rewarded accordingly.,positive
"I recently spent eleven days at the Heritance Hotel Ahungalla and it was definitely a memorable stay! I was given a beautiful room with a view of the pool and beach. It was very comfortable and clean with all amenities and excellent TV (for the occasional rainy day). Special thanks to Saman who really took care of everything in my room to the highest standard. The breakfast, lunch and dinner buffets were beyond expectation with a huge variety everyday. All this thanks to Chefs Kamal and Lakmal and the F&B management Nipun and Pradeep who were so obliging about special meal requests! The Front Office staff, Clive, Sanduni and Dilsha were ever helpful and one cannot forget the Bar staff - Kalinga, Jagath and Ifas. Thanks to them and all the others for a lovely holiday. The property is beautifully maintained and the two swimming pools are marvellous. Every evening there was live music which was great fun. This truly is a perfect destination for all travellers to Sri Lanka.",positive
"Had an awesome time at Heritance . The staff was super friendly. We went there with our baby, and they fulfilled our requirements without any hesitation. The lunch and dinner buffet were the best, The food is good, and the variety is even better. Keep up the good work! 😊",positive
"We stayed in Heritance Hotel for couple of weeks in mid June 2024. We are family of 3 and this was our 1st Holiday in Sri Lanka. On arrival to the hotel we were greeted in very friendly way by lovely staff. Our room was amazing- The biggest we ever had on this kind of Holiday. The bathroom was also big and we always had plenty of fresh towels and toiletries. Hotel is very environmentally friendly and what we loved was that everything in the bathroom was plastic free. One of the 1st things we noticed about the hotel was just cleaned and well maintained it was. The gardens were well tended too- The gardener would always prepare fresh bouquet of flowers and through it directly to us in the morning on the balcony... such a nice gesture 2 swimming pools were always clean and watched by professional staff - we actually witnessed couple of emergencies - The staff was well trained and attended without delay. In both instances it was resolved quickly and successfully Other Hotel staff were extremely hard working- you could not ask for nicer bunch. We had Raveesha and Kalinga among others looking after us at the bar most of the evenings- most hard working people I ever met. Always smiling , would literally go over and beyond to make sure our Holiday would go smoothly In the evening we had Duminda in charge looking after us in the restaurant- Again- what a hard working- always smiling person ! He also advised us on local area and which places best to visit to make our Holiday extra special In the restaurant we could not be be more happy with selection of food. Hotel was very quiet some days due to low season and we would be served at the table- There was always interesting , tasty food on the menu. The days when hotel got busy and restaurant was running at 100% it was packed with delicious fresh food. We love tasting local cuisine and we were spoiled for choice. During the days we tried to explore Sri Lanka and on our returns we often felt like returning home- greeted as family in most friendly manner. We were even invited to be part of the Poya celebration which was organized by hotel for the local people It was absolute pleasure to spend 2 weeks here and we are very grateful to all hardworking staff for looking after us. We look forward to see you hopefully some time again",positive
"Heritance Ahungalla was one of the highlights of our trip to Sri Lanka, largely due the excellent hospitality of all the staff who were attentive and helpful throughout our visit. Dilsha ( Guest relations) was amazing. She was really helpful if you needed anything nothing was too much trouble. The culinary offerings were diverse catering to a variety of tastes with both local and international cuisine. The chefs were on hand to provide for any dietary needs. Nipon in charge of the restaurant also ensured our food was tailored to our needs and was happy to ask the chefs to create any dish we requested as my daughter was struggling with pregnancy. Room service is prompt and attentive, ensuring that your stay is as comfortable and luxurious as possible. The hotel's beachfront location is a highlight, being well maintained and the pools are stunning. Overall, Heritance Ahungalla sets a high standard for hospitality, food, and room service, making it an excellent choice for any travellers seeking a memorable trip.",positive
"The experience we had as a local family of 4 was sooooo out of this world, we went here twice. 2nd time we went with another 2 families with kids. All the kids enjoyed the pool. There was a magic show on our first visit to entertain the kids. On our 2nd visit there was a cup cake decorating workshop for the kids. Both were a hit with the children. One thing none of us can ever forget was the food. Ridiculously large buffet. The action station and kiddies station were the main attraction. Tummies and hearts - full!",positive
An iconic hotel with super service and all modern facilities. Friendly and hospitable staff accompanied by mouthwatering cuisine. Plenty of space to enjoy a lovely vacation. Take time to soak in the genius of Bawa's architecture and tropical modernism with across different moods and tones. Luxurious rooms with all amenities. Highly Recommended.,positive

"We are currently staying in this hotel and couldn't be more happy with the staff,food and hospitality we are receiving The pools are well attended and pool staff is very professional and skilled. Our room is huge and cleaned throughout daily..we really couldn't fault anything One thing I'd like to point out though is the treatment of pets I see all over the island. My heart is breaking when I see the hungry street dogs and cats everywhere...I really hoped it would be different here...I know the money is tight but education is very important too I know there are amazing charities trying to change it but they really need more support from public and government I really hope there are better times coming up for the animals here",positive
Had a lovely vacation at Heritance Ahungalla. Staff was very friendly and the location is excellent. Specially Chathura at front office assisted us to make it a wonderful experience. It was raining and was unfortunate to have the beach experience. Will definitely come back soon.,positive
"It was a great experience i have got in heritance Ahungalla. I got very special warm welcome on arrival than other hotel. Rooms and foods are amazing.

My wife and kids were very friendly with her.She always been with nice smile always.Other staff members also given us excellent service. Due to Dilsha's grateful service we would like to visit again.",positive
"2/5 Poor service, poor rooms, and poor food quality. Particularly the food was bad. Unfortunately I included full board with my booking and I wish I didn’t. I advise you not to come here as you will definitely regret the experience particularly that there are lots more options in the area that are considerably far better. Off course the high end ones can’t be compared as well",negative
"Excellent facilities. Pleasing environment with 2 large pools and access to a golden sand beach. Staff was very attentive to every need and it is the hospitality that stood out the most. Hotel had nightly entertainment, very good dining options, and plenty of outdoor spaces for quiet times. Highly recommend Heritance for a relaxing vacation.",positive

Overall, our stay at Heritance Ahungalla was excellent experience and would highly recommend to anyone seeking a luxurious and memorable experience.""",positive
"Heritance Ahungalle is a beautiful hotel with the feel of luxury and space. We were greeted warmly by the reception staff and taken to our rooms. We were there for 2 nights, 3 days and opted to upgrade ourselves to the sea-view rooms. We did have a view of the sea but one room only had a partial sea-view. The rooms were welcoming, spacious, comfortable and had all the trimmings of a 5 star hotel. The washroom did look a bit dated as it’s an older hotel but was clean. There is a wide and long beach where one could go for walks and the main swimming pool is amazing. There was live music in the evening. On one day there was a saxophonist and he was very good. Out of the three buffets, the breakfast buffet was simply amazing. Even for me who have stayed at many Sri Lankan and overseas hotels, this was a fabulous experience. There was such a variety of fruits, fresh juices, yogurts, cold cuts, cheeses, breads etc to start off. The local herbal porridge (kola kenda) was absolutely delicious. Then there were the hot dishes both Sri Lankan and western with also an omelette station. However, I have to say while the local dishes were excellent, the western and Chinese dishes could be fined tuned a bit more. The Restaurant Manager, Pradeep and his team were simply amazing. They were very friendly, professional and courteous. Pradeep conveyed to us that if there was anything that we specifically need to let him know. He remembered our preferences and acted accordingly. One person in our group was sick one day and the team provided what our friend could eat and made special deliveries to the room. This is greatly appreciated. The only thing that was a negative was that we saw a family that was at breakfast, who, later got into the pool in the same clothes. This is quite unhygienic. I didn’t see any boards at the pool side stating that swimwear needs to be worn. I did mention it to the staff at the reception who were aware of this happening. All in all, it was a fabulous experience and a place that we would look forward to come again. The service all round, from the bell boys to housekeeping and to the restaurant was excellent! Thank you Heritance Ahungalla for a great holiday!",positive
"We have spent the last 6 days here - what can I say! It has been fabulous. The hotel was immaculate and the service was brilliant. Everyday we have experience a new height in customer service right through from the cleaner, who has done an amazing job with our room and been very creative with his origami skills, the pool staff have been amazing - I even managed to race the pool lifeguards (they only just beat me!) The bar and restaurant staff have been very attentive. And today, we took part in world environment day, an annual ceremony with local primary school children and were invited to plant a tree at the hotel to help the environment. We will be back",positive
Our family have a few older people with difficulty to walk and few kids. The staff was very supportive and considerate throughout the whole stay. The food was very good and and the pool area is very calm and spacious which was ideal for our large family. The kids ran around and had a great time. Would highly recommend this for a family outing.,positive
"This hotel is absolutely beautiful! The way they designed the building with trees and shrubbery planted in and around the hotel makes you feel like you are part of the nature. It is such a peaceful environment you never want to leave. In addition, the staff is phenomenal. They are very attentive to every little detail and make the experience even more special! We will definitely be returning very soon! Thank you for an unforgettable experience!",positive
Room was excellent and very comfortable .The property is located right in front of the beach and has a very nice breeze. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I would like to mention a special thanks to Sanduni who was at the front desk.Food was good.,positive

Especially I would like to thank Guest Relations Executive Mrs Dilsha who were very supportive during our stay.we are incredibly grateful for her warm and gracious hospitality .The pool area looks very nature friendly.

Awesome place to relax. Fabulous! Thank you! The staff is friendly. Breathtaking view and a splendid atmosphere. Beds are comfortable. The sea breeze is awesome. Evening music session was so relaxing. Thank you for giving us a great stay!,positive
The food was excellent. Spread was so vast that we couldn't even have room to taste a lot of dishes. Went during the vesak weekend and so the bookings were full. Rooms were clean and well maintained. Well worth the price. Will visit again. Thank you heritance,positive
One of the best hotels we’ve stayed at. Was so warm and welcoming. Was a home away from home. Dilsha who was part of the front office staff was one of the friendliest and most welcoming people we’ve met. She made both my son and I feel so welcome. The food was delicious and facilities were top notch!,positive
"Excellent stay. It was a great but off seasonal stay. We didnt expect sucha great atmosphere during this time of the year down sputh. it was fabulous. We stayed at the suite and the pools were great even having a little windy and cloudly weather, we enjoyed it very much",positive
"Exellent hotel with staff dedicated to serving the guests. From Checkin to the bell desk to the restaurant, the staff is always smiling and ready to attend to your needs. The food served at the main restaurant on all 3 meals is very good. There are few live food options also which is very good. The only disappointment is the desert section, which is nothing much, certainly no verity. Rooms are big with comfy beds, fluffy towels, excellent amenities, and a good combination of tea and coffee. You are set for a comfortable stay. Because of the heavy rains, we used the pool only for a limited time. But they do have 2 large pools and a pool bar also.",positive
A really good place to go with your family. The staff was really friendly. The service was excellent. The rooms were great. The food was delicious. There was an excellent variety of food. I really liked their pool . The rooms had a good view of the beach outside. I highly recommend,positive
"The rooms were great,the staff were friendly and hospitable and the food was delicious .I especially enjoyed the breakfast spread and the variety it provided.The pools are well maintained and spacious .The easy access to the beach provided us with scenic views essential for a vacation photo session .highly reccomend it.",positive
We stayed in Luxury Suite room for one night FB and it had spacious cozy living area with sofa and separate bedroom. The service we received from hotel staff from welcome at the entrance to entire stay was amazing. This hotel had one of the widest delicious buffet spreads. Recommend as a must visit hotel and planning to be here again.,positive
"This is a first class hotel right on the beach. Very spacious well equipped rooms, beautiful grounds and 2 large pool. Nice restaurant with Buffett but was lacking the choices we had experienced elsewhere in Sri Lanka. The family members I travelled with like a cocktail before dinner but less than half the cocktails listed on the menu were unavailable. They had no limes in a country that has heaps of citrus fruit. We stayed a few nights and still no limes at the end. Only a small thing but I’m sure they could have bought some just outside the resort.",neutral
"Very nice hotel and great view, clean and the staff is friendly and nice. Food was great and room service was neat. Love it and would definitely recommend for couples families and even business. The pool is always clean and all facilities are well equipped.",positive

Nice and calm place. Staff is very friendly. During our visit there were so many fun activities which included activities for kids as well. Recommended for corporate activities such as staff development programs and etc. Beach is clean and well maintained. Cheers,positive
"Ten years ago, we spent our honeymoon here and it’s still one of our favourite places in Sri Lanka. We really appreciate all arrangements made by the staff to make our wedding anniversary extra special. Food and the hospitality was amazing as always. But room could use some improvement and improve on attention to smaller details.",positive
Very relaxing hotel. Super friendly staff. Front office to room service and dining area staff all exceptional. Good food choice with some wonderful cocktails. Being a local I tried all local produce especially old arrack and gin with mixers. Live music at the lounge was really good and relaxing near the pool. We even danced a bit. Parking on site for our cars was very convenient. Clean rooms and bathrooms. Will definitely return soon,positive
"I have to say that Ahungalla was the best hotel in my 8 day's trip in Srilanka. What you will have: 1) A super swimming pool when you arrive in the lobby which is directly face to the ocean and it links with beach. 2) All the smiling faces in reception, F&B and guest relationship. 3) A wooden nice room with clean and comfortable bed. 4) Very much cozy environment with cool lighting and srilanka cultural decorations. Thanks to all the people who helped and served us: (Who I remembered name's) Dilsha from Guest Relation/Pradeep from F&B/Nimna and Rahul from hot kitchen.",positive
Good hotel to visit …………………………………………… Hats off to the Chef Balbeer for arranging the Indian vegetarian food for us……………………… Property is nice and clean…………………………… Best part is the beach and pool in the hotel Overall good experience…………..,positive
"The staff are nice. But the tables in the restaurant are very sticky. We had stayed 2night. The food is quite delicious and changed. My husband and I massage in the spa together, the staff whisper through the whole process. It’s uncomfortable.",neutral
The room service is great! The towel art done by Mr.Rukmal were super creative and fun. The food was also good. The overall design of the hotel was excellent,positive
"We went to Sri Lanka, and spent 5 days at the end of our trip at this hotel. It is quite tired, but this was offset by magnificent pools, best food, and really good service. Had the service and food been bad, we would not consider the place. But it was great, hence the positive review. Only problem is that there are no villagers around, so other than the polluted beach, not much to see. Or do.",positive
"A very nice hotel, lovely friendly staff! Nice clean rooms. Beach a little bit choppy this time of year but a nice calm one a couple miles up the road. Good tours (safar etc) locally. The food at this hotel was brilliant, very accommodating for allergies too.",positive
We are having an amazing stay at Heritance ahungalla. Starting from the checkin process the service has been amazing. Kudos to the reception staff for going out of their way to ensure our satisfaction. The food was perfect and the room and all other facillities were spoton. The staff in this place keeps the orgsnisation going no matter what.,positive
"I’ve spent wonderful days at Heritance Ahungalla thanks above all to the lovely and very kind Ms Sanduni who took care of me during my staying,and also thanks to the master chefs Lakmal and Heshan who delighted me with excellent dishes and cakes.I really hope to go back again.",positive
"We went there in the beginning of April during awurudu festival . We had a really good stay . The rooms were quite comfortable and kept clean . The property is huge and has 2 swimming pools as well . The beach is easily acessible, it’s right Infront of the beach . The best part about this vacation however was the staff . Extremely welcoming , friendly , accommodating to all our needs . They exceeded expectations . Especially the guest relationship officer , unfortunately I forgot her name but she made sure to check on us every day that she saw us in the lobby and my toddler really grew fond of her as well . I believe she is from Matara . . We also really enjoyed the entertainment ie the fire dancing and the live singing . The food was good I’m the cofffee shop I’m not so sure about the main restaurant as we did not eat there ( except for breakfast which had a big variety ). Thankyou to the heritance team for providing us with such a wonderful experience",positive
The experience at Heritance Ahungalla was simply amazing. The highlight of it all was the welcome experience The reception staff was absolutely brilliant they paved the way for us to have a fabulous stay in this resort. Not to mention the food was out of this world. We will definitely return. As the hospitality and the warm smiles are contagious.,negative
"A short midweek trip with family and friends. Check in took a tad longer than expected. Booked a suit which was located centrally close to both pools and had a large sitting room separate from the bed room. it was excellent as we could have a get together with friends whilst the kids slept in. The spacious balcony opened out to a view of the hotel pools n garden, the golden sands and the westward sea. As it was a midweek day with less crowd, was not expecting much of a spread at the buffet, How wrong I was! It was less than on a weekend but still could hold its own with any hotel's weekend spread. Any foreign guest gets introduced to a good selection of Sri Lankan specialities, Italian pasta station to Indian Doses to Mongolian mixed rice action stations were all busily catering to individual requirements. The fruit selection at breakfast was amazing. The staff are friendly and helpful. Rooms were spotlessly clean. Pradeep the manager at the dinning hall was super! He was checking up on almost all the tables, assisting where ever needed. one of the lil kids at our table had a special request which was taken care of in a matter of minutes much to the amazement of our group. Had such a good time will be returning for sure!",positive
"We had a great stay at this place , loved how helpful and attentive the staff was , Maduranga specially was very attentive and friendly. The food was amazing !! We had a great time at the pools. The rooms were spacious and had a great view. Would recommend this place <3",positive

Outstanding hotel in fantastic beach location. The bar and restaurant service is exemplary as is the cleanliness. The staff are friendly and can’t do enough for you. Spacious rooms are spotless and well equipped. Also recommend trip to one of the nearby turtle conservation centres.,positive
"This is meant to be a 5 star hotel, but is lacking in so many areas. The positives first. The restaurant staff and room cleaning staff were excellent. The rooms are very nice, spacious and beds are extremely comfortable. Unfortunately the reception staff and management were extremely unhelpful and didn’t address issues when highlighted. We visited during Sri Lankan new year and we knew shops and restaurants would be closed, we asked the reception staff and were advised Fri and sat (which is what we expected) I also asked if they knew if restaurants in Galle would be open on the Sunday and was advised they would all be closed as still new year so better to stay at the hotel. This was incorrect as a discovered through a Facebook forum and visited Galle on the Sunday were all restaurants were open. This felt like an attempt to keep you in the hotel spending money. The prices at the hotel were also questionable. The hotel we stayed in the week before had clear pricing on there menu eg Nani goreng 1800 Sri Lankan rupees. The heritance menu do 10% state service charge to be added, but also to be added is 18% vat meaning the prices stated which were already at least 20% higher than the previous 5star rated hotel we had stayed in were much more costly than other similarly rated hotels and more concerningly this isn’t clear. The pools open at 8am which is fine as they need to clean them, but the bed cover and towels aren’t available until 8am and as I am an early riser and like to get up and spend some time in the sun before breakfast and the sun gets too hot this was disappointing. Also out of the 5 nights we stayed here I had to trek around the resort on 3 separate days to find a pool attendant as you can’t get the mattress and towels yourself, having gone to reception on 2 occasions it took until 9 am on 2 of the days to get the towels and mattresses, and all the manager Clive could do was apologise, which given it happened again the following morning was very poor. The issue clearly hadn’t been addressed. Also around the pool, wasn’t cleaned with cigarette ends (dissapointing that’s scruffy guests leave this is the first place) plastic bottles and beer caps left on the grass for the last 4 days we were there. I would not recommend this hotel to stay at and instead would highly recommend the 5 star Taj Bentota which is only 20 minutes away and is excellent with much more around the hotel as well which if you want to explore is great.",negative
We stayed there in new year seson so was bit crowded. Staff is really good and friendly. Food was delicios and had many varieties. Room was not modern design but it was okay for us. Hotel will be a good option if you are looking for a good dinner / lunch buffet.,neutral

one of the best beach front hotel i ever visited...great customer service...cozy comfy rooms & best part was the food...filled with various type of food and all are tasty...got the pleasure of attending the avurudu ceremony and it was all fun and enjoyable...,positive
"The worst hotel I’ve been to, even 1 star is a lot , this should be a 5 stars hotel but it’s the total opposite, rooms are very old and dirty, corridors are horrible, and when I made a complain their explanation was it’s rustic architecture not dirty and it’s not an international hotel it’s a National hotel, which didn’t make any sense to me What does cleanliness have to do with National or international, the restaurant was like a fish market, stations were unclean and no hygiene at all, in the reception they were putting a welcome drink trolley when I stood by it the servant told me that it’s only for check In customers, people in the hotel aren’t allowed to drink which is very funny… I came with my family to relax for couple of days but unfortunately it was a disaster..",negative

We have been to this hotel 4 times already. The staff is super friendly and customer oriented. I love the pool and the beautiful beach.

I absolutely love my stay here at Heritance Ahungalla. The staff here are super accomadating and kind.

"Categorically unacceptable conditions in controversial situations, the hotel thinks only about profit. This is not a 5* hotel, the furniture and renovations are from the 80s, and in some places there is fungus in the showers and on the balconies. Location is the end of the world, transfer to civilization from the hotel is very expensive for Sri Lanka. I do not recommend it if you have actually previously vacationed in 4*-5* hotels.",negative
"Dulaj,a front office staff, provided the best and great service with a smile. He went out of his way to ensure that we were happy with our rooms. Pradeep,food and beverage, provided exceptional service. Our requests for coconut water and masala chai were gladly met. Food was fresh and yummy and there was a good range of beverages. We enjoyed the cooking demonstration on Monday 25th March. The young budding chef prepared delicious mouth watering mustard chicken curry, fried rice and long bean curry. My wife and I from Gold Coast and our friends from Melbourne, Australia really enjoyed our stay at the beautiful Heritance on the Beach.",positive
"Great hotel , great facilities, great clean beach , great breakfast , best ocean views , lovely live music in evenings . Fantastic staff always ready to assist . Special thanks to Pradeep in reception who went out of his way to act on our special requests.

One of the best places in Ahungalla. Had a great time with family enjoying the stay at the hotel without any distractions. The hotel is located in a beautiful location having the direct access to the beach. The food was excellent and the buffet included a lot of varieties. The staff was really supportive and the hotel rooms were great. Thanks Dilrangi,positive
"Return visit to this hotel, we still found the hotel excellent . Situated on a lovely large beach and in a great location.rooms good size clean and comfortable. 2 large swimming pools which were never to busy especially the green pool, plenty of sun beds with the staff happy to move them in and out of the sun when you needed it. Good food in both the restaurants with good service by the staff, plenty of choice with some cooked fresh while you waited .we would like to especially thank Chamila Jananjaya for his excellent friendly service and Kavinda Heshan for going out his way to cook gluten-free bread’ pasta and pancakes for us. The night time entertainment in the pool bar was good with excellent cultural shows. We were all inclusive and the local drinks and cocktails were good. Would have liked to have more yoga classes as only had one available during the 2 weeks we stayed. Great holiday and will be returning soon. Thanks to all the staff that made it a great holiday.",positive
"The staff and the food are the best things about staying at this hotel. Staff are very kind, welcoming and attentive. Everywhere around the hotel whether it is the staff greeting you at dinner, or waiting, or around the pool and sorting out sun loungers, the staff are friendly, work extremely hard and make you feel at ease. The supervisor, Chamuditha made sure that everything was going well with our holiday, helped us with information, and was kind also , so full marks to all the staff. Thank you. The food at this hotel is so good. A real choice at the buffet. I love all the Sri lankan food and the women who make the hoppers are very skilled. The bar is also a great area for entertainment and drinks. The gym is fine and is air conditioned, a small room but weights and machines did the job. Things that could be improved might be that some parts of the hotel are a bit old and could do with updating and a lick of paint or the hotel could do with some more decoration, however in the end none of this detracted from the stay. The aircon was great and the beds are comfy. One thing I'm not keen on are people on the beach hassling you to sell you things when you just want to enjoy the beach but the hotel doesn't have jurisdiction over that. We had a lovely stay and would recommend staying here.",positive
"The hotel really is tired, needs updating and a good clean in places , some staff rude and unhelpful. All inclusive package is not worth the money as they run out of the decent beer and water down cordial to put into spirits as you can’t have fresh juice. Food is very good. I find the hotel is not like the pictures. Sun beds are filthy and in need of a clean. Swimming pools are too hot and could do with some cold water as it is not refreshing when your sunbathing and need to cool down.electrical sockets came out of the wall and needed to be repaired, patio doors did not shut properly this also had to be rectified. Needed som information on transport from reception and we were told to Google it, Unbelievable. Shame there is not separate smoking areas as you choke on smoke wherever you go. I am well travelled and shocked that this hotel shows 4 stars. Other than this I would recommend to anyone who wants a 3 star hotel.",negative

"This is one of my fav hotels down south even though it is one of the oldest hotels and first one designed by renowned architect, Geoffrey Bawa. The facilities including the two big pools are great. The rooms were very spacious. The breakfast and dinner spread was fantastic and yummy. The service levels were great especially by Chamudita and Dharshana (restaurant staff leads)",positive
It was really nice stay in Heritance Ahungalla. I really appreciate how nice and friendly were people there. Many thanks for always smiling Chef Heshan - he was really halpfull and kind. For me his pastries are at the highest world level. Many thanks,positive
"Of all the hotels I've been to, I will definitely return to this one! All the staff are Unique! These are not just staff, these are people every fine hotel should have! Exceptional professionals who know how to make your stay and vacation unforgettable! Spotlessly clean room daily, thank you Lokusuviqa. Pastry Chef Kavinda Hashan, followed every single detail meticulously, assisted all the guests punctually, nothing was missing. Special thanks to Kaveesha and Dilsha- guest relations executive, you girls are awesome. The guy who used to make my unique vegetables, thanks Prarodha, you are the top. And now I pay special attention to a wonderful boy who really impressed me a lot. Special thanks to CHAMUDITHA who is an amazing SUPERVISOR . He is extremely responsive and helpful throughout our stay. His positive spirit made our stay very nice and smiling. For sure for our next holiday we will back in Sri Lanka Heritance hotel . Thanks to Chamuditha . All good hotels should have such staff! My stay at this hotel was simply fantastic and I would recommend it to everyone I know!",positive
"Very kind people. One young man stood out among the rest - a great professional, I watched him carefully with interest. He was a supervisor and took care of the guests both personally and with clear and concise instructions to his staff so no one knew if there was a problem or not and everyone was super happy. This young man's name is: Chamuditha",positive
"Hello everyone We stayed at this hotel with a friend from Feb 12 to Feb 22, 2024 I want to say right away that the hotel is great, but first things first The beach is just wonderful - very wide, clean sand, garbage is removed, the entrance to the ocean is gentle. There are waves, but they are small for Sri Lanka, so we enjoyed swimming The rooms are clean, some of the furniture is already tired, but they clean very well, our cleaner tried very hard and left flowers and extra water in our room every day, even brought chocolates on the first day of acquaintance) Sunbeds and towels - free ones could be found in the hotel at any time of the day, the staff very quickly brought towels, rearranged the sunbeds in any place at our request and all with a smile. we were buying mangoes and one afternoon we decided to eat on the territory, so the employee saw this and brought us a plate and a knife so that it would be convenient for us, although we did not ask - but it was very pleasant. I especially want to say about the food - we took breakfasts and dinners. Here is a direct respect to the chef - it is very diverse and very tasty: both European cuisine and Sri Lankan cuisine. There are always several options for meat, fish, squid, crabs were given every day, on some days there were even oysters - it's amazing for a buffet, I've been to many countries, but I haven't seen oysters on the buffet yet. There are a lot of different desserts and they are just delicious. Even my picky friend with gastritis praised the food in the restaurant)) I especially want to mention the waiters - in buffet restaurants on the stream they are usually tortured, but here everyone is smiling, sincerely trying to help you, tell you something if you ask I would like to thank the Maduranga waiter and the Lakmal chef for their special attitude and kindness in everything) The only thing that bothered me was the overly intrusive sellers of tours and tuk-tuk taxis, who simply did not let me pass anywhere quietly. Moreover, if you refuse them, they become aggressive, so I immediately share good contacts so that you do not have to waste time searching like us. According to recommendations from other tourists, we used proven and very adequate guys - here I give them contacts, maybe someone will also come in handy Chathumal Tuk-tuk Driver +94 77 440 6412 - speaks English well Car driver and guide Praneeth +94 77 619 8012 - he speaks English well, can tell a lot of historical and cultural facts - this is much better than taking drivers and guides at the hotel - they tell very little, they just drive like drivers Russian tours - Daria +94 76 188 4399 - it is more expensive, but for those who need Russian guides For all contacts, you can just write to whatsapp and negotiate - everything is simple and fast In general, the hotel is suitable for a relaxing holiday, most of the guests are elderly couples. It will also be boring for children here, but for those who want to relax and switch, it's just a great option",positive
Special thanks to Chamuditha who is an amazing supervisor. He is extremely responsive and helpful throughout our stay. His positive spirit made our stay very nice and smiling. For sure for our next holidaywe will back in Sri Lankain heritance hotel thanks to Chamuditha.,positive

"The people who work here are amazingly nice and friendly. They constantly pay attention to our needs, we can only recommend the place. One of the nicest workers here, Chamuditha, was ready to answer our every request. We are very grateful! We plan to return.",positive
This is our 2nd stay at this stunning property. Thoroughly enjoyed our 5 night's stay. We were privileged to stay in the executive suite which was great. We checked in on the Valentines day and was able to witness the valentines day celebration put together by the hotel staff on the beach. The GRO Dilsha who checked us in was very friendly and made sure everything was up to our satisfaction. Breakfast has a wide variety of Western and Sri Lankan dishes. Dinner buffet was outstanding and each day had a different theme. Chefs night was interesting with music provided by the chefs and waiters serving in Chefs uniforms. Upon request we were served with authentic polos curry cooked by Chef Saranga Bodinayaka. The best Polos curry we have eaten!! 2 staff in the restaurant Waruna and Jacob were good. Lasan and Chamindu in house keeping did an excellent job. Always with a smile. Kudos to Sisira Senaratne (GM) Who made our stay a memorable one.,positive
Unfriendly staff Fake smiles Attitude Lack of flexibility I feel like a burden on the hotel I didn’t feel like a guest at all Discriminative I felt that im not welcomed One of the staff interrupted me while i was talking to his colleague and told me 1 minute then he started to talk in Sinhala while me standing waiting for his permission to talk lol My first and last stay in this hotel,negative
"Perfect Hotel. Perfect Beach. And we finde a perfect Driver. If you value a safe and perfect ride, Indrajith de Silva is the right address for you. He drives very carefully and prudently. He always kept an eye on us in stores and places of interest. It was important to him to visit our places and not the places where he gets commission. He is well educated and it is fun to talk to him about the country and the culture. He also has a well-maintained and comfortable car. In short, the perfect driver in Ahungalla. Contact him. +94777761631 Regards, Thomas",positive
The service was very nice.And the food was very nice . All the amenities were nice and hygienic. The staff were very helpful with all the requests. The sunset view is gorgeous in the evening. The pool was very big and the cleanliness and the safety were on point. I will definitely be recommending this hotel. And plan to visit Heritance Ahungalla again.,positive
Thanks to Dilsha and Chef Kamal we had a fantastic day. The hotel was fully booked so we couldn’t stay.. We had a fantastic day in the pool with easy access to the beach. Lunch was a feast. Seafood galore and lots of yummy puds. Thanks Kamal ( Chef Ashan and fam),positive
nicest hotel staff ever experienced. very friendly people. everything is very clean and tidy. especially Supervisor Chamuditha and Trainee Eranda made our stay a very pleasent and memorable experience. it was our first time in sri lanka and not the last time in Heritance hotel for sure. greetings from switzerland (Vale & Vivi),positive
"Very much enjoyed our stay here. Lovely peaceful grounds , two large pools, lovely long, Sandy Beach to walk along. Sanduni was very patient with us all when we arrived, sorted out the rooms to our total satisfaction which ensured we had a great time here. We took taxis to Hikkaduwa for snorkelling and Galle for browsing, they're a reasonable price. The first driver was excellent- ML Pemasiri, we'd recommend him, booked via reception. All the staff are very friendly and helpful.",positive
"I stayed with my extended families, altogether 05 families on a half-board basis on 03 February. The stay as expressed by other members too was splendid. We were welcomed by Ms.Dilsha who was courteous and hospitable. As and when I saw her, she was wearing a broad smile moving around briskly to see to the convenience of guests. She even took some time to talk to us while we were relaxing at the Lobby after check-out. The dinner and breakfast buffet spread was generous and splendid tantalizing the taste buds. We enjoyed our short stay to the fullest surrounded by tranquility and soothing breeze.",positive
"This is a lovely hotel. All the staff are always smiling and can’t do enough for you. From reception staff, bar staff, waiters they are all lovely. We stayed on a BB basis and the breakfast was very good with plenty of choice. We also ate in the Al a carte several times and was always good. If you are looking to do some trips speak to Siri on the beach. We done 3 trips with him and they were great value. Very good English speaking drivers and English speaking guides. If you want a truly traditional Sri Lankan curry speak to Siri. He can arrange this for you. Food was amazing. My husband had be wanting a spicy fish curry but all the ones we tried were no very spicy. Sandamali Boat safari do river trips with traditional Sri Lankan food. They cooked us a Sri Lankan curry for our evening meal which was delicious and nice and spicy. Can highly recommend for a great Sri Lankan experience. We also tried the bamboo massage which was great. Just ask Siri he’ll show you the way. Karen and Michael (England)",positive
"Although the hotel is not entirely new, the rooms have good quality furniture and a wide balcony; we got a room on the third floor with a view of the sea and garden The air conditioner works well and silently, there are no Russian channels, but there is a purely music channel, the food is very decent seafood, squid, shrimp, crabs, oysters, beef tenderloin, pineapples, Pattaya, but they rarely served arugula, my favorite greens and Wine is only available in the restaurant, bar, cocktails and beer. But the main thing is that the ocean and a warm pool of 35 degrees are nearby and there are no water-motor modes of transport, a clean endless ocean Live music in the evening but not all musicians are good Requests to notice partially live music on compositions from the Internet were refused, so many evenings it was a bit boring. I don’t recommend using taxi drivers near the hotel reception, the prices are too high, it’s better to take a tuk tuk on the street+94 77 950 4156 Alim , you should also not leave things on the sunbeds in the evening, they took my swimming trunks this way, and you should be even more careful in the shops in a tent Opposite Rio, they didn’t want to give change, we had to threaten that we’d take away everything that was on the windows, then they returned it, I think I’ll come back here next time",neutral
Had a great stay there with our 8 months old baby. Super service and best buffets with good spread. We were very comfortable with the support of the staff. Nice beach and pool area. Safe environment. Highly recommended to experience a stay there.,positive
"Apart from the hotel, which offers a lot, great food, beautiful rooms. 10/10... I met here the most wonderful people in the world. I won't reveal too much... you have to visit this place yourself! Dilsha & Chamuditha Thank you so so much!!!!!",positive
We have stayed at herritance few times before and they didn’t disappoint this time also . Great staff good food and excellent views of the beach. From this trip special mention to Nipun from the front office and Waruna firm the service side. Had a great birthday dinner on the beach which was memorable. On my list of hotels to come back always,positive
Outstanding service from the beautiful Sri Lankan staff at this hotel. We celebrated my husbands 50th birthday and were treated like royalty. Strongly recommend all to come here and enjoy. Suite was wonderful and pool was amazing. Breakfast was vast and plentiful.,positive
"Whilst we did not stay here, the hotel looked fantastic. Can definitely recommend one of the hotel drivers for tours. Sampath is a polite, attentive and knowledgeable driver/tour guide. He has a lovely modern air conditioned car. We went on a few long trips with him and everything was perfect. He does not operate from the beach but does do trips for some of the booking agents there. His phone number is +94 76540 2575",positive
Excellent Hotels and very friendly Staff there specially Housekeeping manger Mr.Janaka and Front Desk MIs Sunethra and all the staff did great support my friends to make more memorable holidays. Highly recommend,positive

"What a wonderful hotel ! Combining as it does all that's best in Sri Lankan food, friendlyness and hospitality with the architecture of Geoffre Bahwa. Comfortable roomsand top rate service from all the staff. A special mention must go the 'room boy' Rukmal. His towel art always raised a smile when we returned to our room. Darshan , the guest services executive, along with the rest of reception staff were also incredibly helpful ,especially when I unfortunately damaged my toe. Thnks to Everyone. A superb hotel !",positive
"The hotel is clean, well protected, food excellent local and intercontinental, the staff helpful and polite. Nimalsiri de Silva Tours I highly recommend for excellent organisation skills and focus to make our trips comfortable and safe",positive
"Well done stay as the first experience in Sri Lanka, lovely and friendly staff ready always to help, what is national side of local people we loved. Our gratitude to all staff working hard for guests, especially to Rukhal from cleaning staff, my friend Mr. Nelka from swimming bar always friendly and smiled. We respect all their efforts to make our stay comfortable and enjoyed. The restaurant guys prepared palak-panic specially for us, so cute. We noted that a location is not so important because you may find all entertainments in your hotel or it might be outside visiting of sightseeings. We do recomend Mr. Sunny (sunnytours__srilanka) on this matter, speaking English, German and Russian well.",positive
"We had a great stay at Heritance Ahungalla this January! The hotel provides excellent quality for its price, everything is clean and comfortable. The staff was very nice everywhere, from the reception to the restaurant, and always responsive to our needs (special thanks to our housekeeper Rukmal, who made our stay even more comfortable:)). There is great food for every taste at the restaurant, if you’re curious about traditional food — it’s going to be heaven for you! There are always multiple types of curries, kottus and biriyanis, that vary every day. If you want something more familiar in food you will be satisfied too! We really miss having fresh sweet fruits with every meal. There are two pools at the hotel, one is very big and popular among kids, and the other one is smaller but way quieter and just heavenly. The nature at the hotel territory is very pleasant for the eye. There are some cute little animal visitors on the territory, but no scary big reptiles or insects (you need to be cautious of mosquitoes tho). There is live music in the lobby every night and one of the evenings we were surprised with a beautiful cultural show. On our first day we met a great tour guide whose name is Nimal, we bought an excursion from him to go to the old town of Galle and were very satisfied! We’ve had a great day, Nimal brought us to various great places and recommended a nice restaurant, we’ve taken our time and explored all these places and the old town itself. We definitely recommend Nimal’s tours! He is a great man that you can trust and always ask for a ride. I hope your stay goes as pleasant as ours! Thank you Heritance Ahungalla!",positive
"Excellent hotel, everything was perfect, clean rooms, polite staff, water aerobics every day at 11, varied and high-quality food in the restaurant. We took the all-inclusive package and ordered a Srilanka surprise cocktail every day😁. In the main restaurant there are 2 employees, I would like to mention Chamila and Chamuditha, and also Nadeesha at reception, very attentive, polite, pleasant.❤️ The area is beautiful, there are a lot of different animals: monitor lizards, monkeys, chipmunks, fireflies in the evenings, it was very interesting for both children and adults. In the evenings they hold various events, including local dancing, fire shows, singing, and various games. 2 weeks of vacation flew by quickly. Thank you Ahungala Heritance for an unforgettable vacation!❤️ Today is the last day of our vacation, it is sad to leave this place. If we ever come to Sri Lanka, we will definitely come to Ahungala Heritance! I will recommend it to all my friends!😍 With love, Rooms 108, 110 and 342 :)",positive
Thank you very much for your hospitality and high quality of the service. I was very happy and hope will see you again.

Thank you and wish you all the best,positive
"Amazing architecture and cannot fault the staff; so attentive and kind. Think some of the rooms needs a refurb but nothing drastic just some TLC. Lovely pool, easy access to the beach. Food was pristine.",positive
"Heritance Ahungalla is a true gem, with very nice and kind personal and great hospitality. My stay was elevated by the exceptional service provided by Chamiditha supervisor, whose attention to detail and warm hospitality added an unforgettable touch to the experience. Moreover, I had different towel figures every day and it really cheered my up. Also, I love the food, it was very various and tasty every day!",positive
"Me and my partner always look forward to spending time at the heritance Ahungalla. What we like the most about the Heritance is its peaceful and relaxing environment. The hotel is designed by Geoffry Bawa who is a famous Sri lankan architect. The architecture blends beautifully with the surrounding natural environment with both open and hidden spaces to fully-immerse in the nature. As the hotel is located in front of a beautiful unspoiled beach it allows for long walks and experiencing the beautiful sunsets. Moreover, the main swimming pool is in front of the beach allowing you to admire the sea and the beach while swimming. The main reason that make us always come back to heritance Ahungalla is the friendliness of the staff. They always welcome us with a smile and make sure we are taken care of. Big mention goes to Duminda, Rebecca and Waruna from the restaurant who are always there to provide all we need and to make sure we have a wonderful experience at the restaurant. They always give us advice on the best food combinations to satisfy our food preference, as well as general advice and they are always there for us. The food at the restaurant is wonderful with a great selection from sri lankan, Indian, thai and European food. I fully recommend the heritance Ahungalla because of the wonderful experience provided by the friendly and welcoming staff, the tranquil environment, the quality of food and the amazing unspoiled beach. The best experience at the heritance Ahungalla is the new year celebration, offering the best buffet with ice sculpture and international food, bbq and sri lanka delights.",positive
"We stayed at Ahungulla Heritance just after Christmas 2023 - without family plus 13 friends. From checkin-to checkout, was a seamless process. The staff, lobby, pool, bar, restaurants and room - were super warm, friendly, attentive and efficient. There was a good mix of guests - UK, Russia, Australia, US, Estonia and Japan (from what I noticed). The kids had a great time in the pool - fun ball sports in the pool too. Beach was clean and had plenty of folks on it. The restaurants, both a la cart and buffet food was sensational - I just need to have a little more self control at the buffet! 😂 A big Thank You to all the Staff at Ahungulla Heritance for a thoroughly enjoyable stay. Cheers, Harin",positive
"Great hotel with great service! nice beach and varied food! Special thanks to waiters Dilusha and Bathiya. My daughter loved Dilusha! Very attentive and friendly.! Room service is very clean and helpful. There are a lot of animals in the garden, chipmunks and monkeys",positive
Our day outing here was fascinating. Hotel was very well maintained. Swimming pool was large enough to move around. Ample variety of food was available. The Restaurant Manager Duminda was exceptionally helpful and hospitable.,positive
"It was an amazing stay. The room was beautiful and comfortable. Everything from the check-in to check out was managed so well by the team. Excellent service.Special thanks to Dilsha the guest relations officer who is so welcoming, helpful and a warm personality. The food spread quality and taste is a different level. Will definitely go back.",positive
"Graduation Dinner...!!! "" After my Son's MBBS Convocation on 15th December 2023 we celebrated his Graduation Dinner at Heritance Hotel in Ahungalla. Which was the best decision we made as overall they gave us Kind & Warm Hospitality , Delightful Food & Professional Service !!!. Starting Heritance Ahungalla General Manager Mr. Sisira Senarathna & entire Management Team including RM Mr. Rasika, Ex. Chef Kamal, Sous Chef Umesh, Pastry Chef Gayan ,Restaurant & Bar Manager Mr. Duminda & his team , even Valet Parking & Bell Desk members at Lobby area were very polite and decent .They extended their sincere service more than up to our expectations.

"Me and my family visited Heritance Ahungalla.I have visited two times previously to this hotel. compare to previous visits this time is worst one. Rooms are not clean, and bathroom does not have hygienic seal and bathroom amenities such as toothpaste, toothbrush, slippers, water glass. But I love this hotel very much and food is tasty but does not have more verities except lunch. Restaurant is lonely place especially action station area has lack of persons to serve customers, awaiting lengthy period to taste food. I appreciate service of lifeguard who work at main pool on 16th October 2023. But overall, it was an enjoyable day, and we enjoyed a lot because this time we have room which have both sea and pool view. Beautifully design swimming pool is another attraction has large beach front. I Highly recommended this hotel, but you must improve your customer care and room service. Further I think it would be better if the old boat which is previously locate near the pool is restore because it is iconic attraction of the hotel.",neutral
"The hotel itself is more than enough for a great holiday. You have your pool, your beach, and your room. The staff is polite and friendly. The food is good to great. Lots of meats and veggies. We only had breakfast and dinner - both were good. However, there were many problems. The rooms are somewhat clean. I believe Sri Lanka was open for tourism long enough to learn how to properly serve customers, but they are still… bad. So don’t expect a perfect room. Rukmal - good cleaner who tried his best to make our stay more pleasant. Appreciate the towel elephant) Also - as long as you are not afraid of wild animals (monkeys, monitor lizards, insects), you will be fine. Otherwise, there are not many places to go to on the hotel premises. These animals are everywhere and I personally was terrified. Nevertheless, great opportunity to get close to wildlife! Overall, the weather and the ocean were unbelievable! Everything else is just a minor inconvenience. Would recommend!",positive
"We arrived in Heritance Ahungalle on Friday 8th Dec 2023 with a bunch of friends.Everyone, starting from the bell boy ,front office, restaurant, room service, pool, bar and housekeeping were very friendly and courteous and greeted us with a warm smile. The food was just 👍 great and divine and each and every dish was deliciously made with much love and care.Even the most simplest 'kola kenda' , ' lunu miris', and all the western dishes were very flavourful and ""out of this world "" The crispy batter fried fish served with tartar sauce during lunch was just awesome and liked by all. The ""steaming pittu served with pol kiri and lunumiris and the hot hot hoppers made with love during breakfast was just amazing. "" PANI APPA "" is a must try by everyone. The live band which performed on Friday night was simply amazing and their songs were so soothing to listen to and helped us to dance our cares away. The Christmas decor done by the housekeeping section using all sustainable products is highly commendable. Hats off to the General Manager Mr.Sisira Senarathne for a over all good show Looking forward to be there once again to celebrate the New Year's Eve.

"Had an amazing stay at Heritance Ahungalla. Rite from the time we arrived we were welcomed with open arms, the checkin process was swift and smooth. The food offerings was an brilliant layout of scrumptious delicacies. Overall we loved every bit of our stay and we will definitely return.",positive
Extremely friendly and helpful staff.. I lost my key card during my stay but they were super nice about it and replaced it without a fuss.. a good variety of food as well.. rooms were lean and well kept..,positive
First advice is please don't go to this hotel. Except the location there is nothing. They are unable to serve proper veg food. Rooms have no proper facilities in washroom. Used bed sheets with blood stains are provided. Electric switches are broken. Telephones not working in some rooms. Seepage on walls. Dampness. Washrooms has no exhaust and smell like hell.,negative
We stayed only one night in the hotel which was fully booked this day. The only option was to confirm a suite room. Price was ok since I am a resident and the room spacious and clean. The bath hub is a catastrophe since you cannot enter. The rain shower also should be repaired.... The highlight was the food. Huge selection of local and international food in good quality. I asked for the chef to thank him. His name was Lakmal.,negative
Rakhim every day clean my room. He is smiling and always helped me when I didn't turn to him. He is a good person and an employee. A perfectly clean room. He's friendly and nice. I had a good time in Heritance Ahungalla.,positive
"Very good hotel, thank you Heritance Ahungala for a great holiday. Also thank you Rukmal for your work and smile. Very tasty food and beautiful view to the ocean, clean room. People always smile. Thank you very much. We comeback.",positive
"I recently visited Sri Lanka, in October 2023, for 2 weeks. It was an amazing experience, a beautiful place to discover. The people of Sri Lanka are welcoming and lovely. I spent most of my holidays in the south of the island, which is on the coastline and therefore dotted by many beaches. During my stay on the island, I was fortunate to have a local driver, Sampath, to drive me, while visiting the island. I first met Sampath at the airport, when he came to pick me up and he greeted me with the word 'ayubowan', which is a traditional and common greeting used in Sri Lanka. Sampath is a lovely gentleman, he was polite, professional and spoke English. He is an excellent and safe driver. Being a local, he had a vast knowledge of places to visit, where to shop and restaurants to eat at. Sampath was very helpful and assisted in organising my visits and trips to the following places; Hikaduwa, Mirissa, known for stilt fishing. On the way to Mirissa, we stopped at Angel Beach in Unawatuna, for lunch. The hotel and restaurant is on the beach front, it was a beautiful place for a bite and a drink while taking in the views of the ocean. Coconut Hill and then onto Galle. The Mask Museum in Ambalangoda. The Natural Moonstone mine and gem palace in Meetiyagoda. Then to Bordeaux restaurant for a seafood lunch and a boat safari on the Madu river. Aryuveda massages at Amalvilla in Bentota. A 2 day excursion to Sigiriya, where I climbed the Lion Rock. Visited the Sacred Tooth Relic Buddhist temple in Kandy. Stayed at the Mount Heaven hotel in Ella, with breathtaking views of the mountains and valleys. A once in a lifetime experience. Visited the Nine Arch Bridge in Ella and caught the train to travel across the bridge. At the end of my 2 weeks, Sampath was my trusted driver on the long drive back to the airport. And it was time to say my goodbyes to a beautiful country and its people, who have captured my heart and given me a lifetime of memories. I would highly recommend Sampath, +94765402575, as a driver and guide, if you ever visit the beautiful island of Sri Lanka.",positive
"My stay at Heritance Ahungalla was disappointing. The management's poor communication left me frustrated, and the staff although willing to help where poorly trained, lacked any authority or understanding of their own systems & processes which lead to a subpar service. The food and bed linens were only of average quality, further diminishing the overall experience.",negative
"My stay at Heritance Ahungulla was truly exceptional. The architectural beauty of this property, a tribute to the genius of Mr. Geoffrey Bawa, is awe-inspiring and visually appealing. The property itself is a work of art. The rooms were tastefully decorated, offering a perfect blend of comfort and aesthetics. The level of comfort in the rooms, was outstanding. The real standout, however, was the staff. Their warmth and commitment to guest satisfaction were remarkable. Their attentive service made a world of difference in making my stay memorable. This property is more than just a place to stay; it's an experience in itself. The architectural beauty, well-decorated rooms, exceptional staff, and delightful breakfast create an extraordinary combination. My stay here was nothing short of exceptional, and I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to return to this remarkable destination",positive
"Very comfortable Hotel right next to the sea. Big Rooms, 2 huge swimming pools. Super friendly staff and the gastronomy was great too. Big variety in the buffet restaurant. There is also a 24/7 a la carte Restaurant for whenever you are hungry",positive

And the staff at the reception are very warm & welcoming! Only suggestion - make sure to segregate the veg options with a proper display. Veg sushi had the display but was mixed with seafood & chicken, and sadly even the chef couldn't figure it out until he tasted it & then confirmed.",positive
"An absolutely beautiful hotel, in a spectacular location. Well-kept, clean and tidy. Rooms are quite spacious and comfortable, equipped with gowns and slippers, toiletries, teas and coffees. Close proximity to the beach. Great food. But the best part for me, are the incredibly warm and kind staff. Special mention to Waruna in the dining hall. Thank you for making our experience that more enjoyable.",positive
On arriving at Heritance Ahungalla……it was 3am and rain not waiting to come down: we didn’t appreciate until the next morning how wonderful and picturesque this place was until the following morning. Our first couple of days were spent getting to know the hotel and its people…….they are the most amazing group who go out of their way to make this a home from home and always have a sole on their face all the time. There are too many staff to mention individually but one who deserves special mention is Rukmal who worked his magic everyday on our room and his inventiveness with towels and flowers is a joy to behold…..we will miss you and your colleagues greatly and will look upon this as one of the most amazing holidays and locations we have ever been on and look at Rukmal’s leaving present for us on our last day……..think it demonstrates everything that is good about this place. Goodbye Sri Lanka and Heritance Ahungalla…….we will definetly return one day…..it’s a must !!!!,positive
"I was there for two nights with two of my French friends (Tour Operators) The first impression on arrival was extremally good and the welcome was quite impressive even together with the General manager himself of the hotel. Well trained staff in every department and food served was too extraordinary and absolutely there was nothing to grumble... However as a five-star property, this hotel needs an immediate renovation pretty soon. The corridors and most of the other public places look very dull and gloomy. Whilst thanking the management for providing us luxury renovated rooms, we also noticed during the hotel visit that the non-renovated rooms too need an immediate upgrading to compete with the upcoming new properties nearby. (it has been noticed that some renovations especially on the roof are underway)",negative
Веautiful and comfortable hotel! Cleaning every day. Friendly and attentive staff! Delicious and fresh food. Clear swimming pools and garden. Beautiful sunsets and dawn. Good live music. Give 5 stars and my heart!,positive
"Amazing!!! Ocean: wide. The beach is beautiful. Great people around, speak Russian! We have been to Sri Lanka more than once, but it was great here, and especially excursions with a Russian-speaking guide Kamal. He showed us tours all over Sri Lanka in his personal new car. Special thanks for the excursions to Kamal. He knows the history and customs of Sri Lanka well, and also showed us many sights of this island - such as; Sigiriya, Kandy, Yalla, Adam's Peak, Adam's Bridge, and we also visited with him the elephant nursery and botanical garden, as well as the nine-arch bridge. Trips and contacts Kamala +94 (77) 608 5334. An excellent guide to Sri Lanka. I definitely recommend it to everyone!",positive
"We had the opportunity to stay for one night. The pool and beach were truly exceptional, providing a delightful experience. The variety offered in all three meals was impressive, with a wide range of flavors that were quite enjoyable. However, I must express my disappointment with the accommodations. The room we were assigned felt quite dated, and the beds were not particularly comfortable. Additionally, the air conditioning unit's controller was malfunctioning, which affected our comfort. The bathroom was notably small, particularly the shower cubicle, making it inconvenient for a comfortable bathing experience. It's worth mentioning that the absence of a hand shower in the bathroom was a drawback. Regrettably, we also found that the staff did not display the same level of friendliness towards locals. Considering our experience, I would suggest this establishment for a day outing rather than an overnight stay.",neutral
"I am still here, few more days left! The food is lovely, and the staff are brilliant - always there to support. The breakfast and dinner buffets were out of this world. The only minor improvement needed is for the lunch buffet, as it's not actually a buffet - you have to order the main meal, which can take a while. The rooms are clean and well kept, but they do look tired. Don't forget to bring your plug adapters. The only quirk is that without the Venetian blind, there's visibility into the toilet and bathroom, so it's more suitable for partners. What might need improving, room facilities, the bathroom/toilet. Can see into the toilet and bathroom, unless you have the blinds down. Lunch is not a buffet. You will have to order from a set menu.",positive
"Wonderful stay, thoroughly enjoyed by all. Highly recommended. Staff gave us a fantastic warm welcome and all around we appreciated the very warm and friendly staff, from reception, housekeeping, pool, restaurant where the very friendly and helpful Waruna and his colleagues looked after us, through to the wonderful and charming GM Sisira, staff were utterly sincere and really keen to extend a warm experience. The food, with their new chef, was outstanding. The hotel and rooms are the best of legendary Bawa's architecture. Loved the clean straight lines, majestic pillars, large and airy rooms with fantastic views, superb in room amenities. The infinity pool, beach views, unrestricted views of the starry sky, lovely clean beach all were breathtaking. I also appreciated some very rare facilities like a good gym, two pools, tennis court, table tennis, badminton, lovely greenery - these are becoming quire rare. Heritage Ahungalle is a true gem. Thank you all for making it a memorable stay",positive
One of the best resorts in the Ahungalla. Really enjoyed our stay in the property. Though the foul smell in the elevator and ongoing construction in our wing was a bit turned off otherwise everything else was really comfortable.,positive
"a group of school friends stayed a couple of nights here. The staff at the hotel were extra accommodative of all the random requests. The check in was smooth, the billing too was quick. We found the meals to be of a high standard. The staff however were so pleasant. We tried to play some school girl games (as we were nostalgically reliving our past). The hotel allocated a separate area for our activity, and even provided efficient fist aid when needed. We had a loud noisy party in the night and the hotel ensured that our merriment was uninterrupted by providing - whatever we needed. Definitely a superior choice of hotel for group outings, looking to have an easy and fun time with good food and staff that are very helpful.",positive
"This was the second time I visited the Hotel. The very first time I visited with my toddler. It was very easy to handle her with the environment. Secondly, it was my corporate trip on Christmas Day. The gala dinner was superb and beyond expectation. It's so magical. Can't believe the way they managed a huge crowd. Service of the staff was also excellent with such a huge crowd. We enjoyed the beach time and magic event very much.",positive
Really enjoyed the hotel ambience. Amazing staff with smiling faces all the time. Food a little disappointed as there are not many options for veg and chicken. Amazing view from the hotel and very clean . Rukmal was amazing in providing service.,positive
"Very nice stay. If you’re choosing this hotel for the stars, don’t. I wouldn’t say it’s a 5* in everything but I will say that the staff deserves even more than 5*! Stay here to be treated right, have a carrying staff and very good food ! I really enjoyed my stay and I would definitely recommend this hotel",positive
"Had a wonderful time visiting with the family for one night over the weekend. Been to Heritance properties quite often and this one too delivers the high standards of the brand. Staff were very helpful, friendly and always welcoming. They didn’t hesitate to fulfil our requests. In a nutshell, Heritance Ahungalla is a very family friendly hotel with quality rooms and dining, topped off with an excellent team of staff. Will come back again.",positive
"WOW!!! We returned to this beachfront hotel 22 years after first visiting, we took our 2 grown up children for a final ""memorable"" family holiday. The staff at the hotel were amazing and when they found out that we had been there in 2001 they made us feel extra special. Both rooms had a sea view, both were large, clean, comfortable and air conditioned. The meals were all buffet style and there were always lots of options to choose from, the quality of food was generally very good and the service of the drinks waiters was fantastic. We were on the all inclusive package and the snack menu available from the bar was extensive but only available between 11-12 and 4-5 unfortunately. The drinks from the bar were great and also had a decent selection of cocktails to choose from. Sunbeds were always available and towels provided. Perhaps the best thing however about this fantastic hotel is the attitude of the staff , we were always being told that if there was anything that we wanted then we only had to ask, and they did indeed provide anything that we requested. Very special thanks to :- Sisira Senaratne (General Manager) Dilsha (guest relations), Nalin and Kalinga (bar staff), Presad (pool attendant), Jacob, Nihal, Jananjaya and Nuwan (restaurant), these are just a few of the brilliant staff members, but every single person at the hotel were so friendly and welcoming. So sorry to leave this wonderful hotel but will hopefully return again soon.",positive
A very good expérience. Staffs are very kind and helpfull and always available. The food is really good with huge variety and good quality too. The view is just extraodinary with swimming pool. Heritance Ahingala is absolutly fabulous.,positive
"Short and Sweet!!! We had such a great stay at this beautiful property Heritance Ahungalle!! From the welcoming smiles and till we departed the stay was just impeccable! Sisira Senaratne and his team are amazing !! Dilsha from guest relations is just the most warm hospitable person, Chef Gayan Thank you for the fabulous dishes !! Loved every single meal we had. Especially the customized lunch on the first day !! Varuna and Nelka from the main restaurant you are super stars !! Thank you for being so humble and accommodating us!! I could go on and on .. Highly recommend a minimum 2 nights stay to make the most of this beautiful place. Thank you for making our stay in Sri Lanka a beautiful one!",positive
"It was a family trip with my husband and my 16-month-old son. The room was very good. We booked a Premium King with Sea View, but we got a pool-view room. However, the view was not bad but wished they gave us what we booked. The food was not as I expected at all. I stayed at this hotel a few years ago and the food was amazing then but this time the food was very average. I got a rotten taste in one of the meat items. The jacuzzis in the pool area were not working also. Overall it was a bad experience because we had high expectations compared to the last stay. Nevertheless, we liked the rooms very much. It was very clean.",neutral
"We booked a hotel for 10 nights. Hotel is really nice with a beautiful ocean view 😍 very friendly and assistive staff. Cleaning was happening every day. The guys from “Dream Tours” agency - Dinesh and Dhanushka made our trip unforgettable. They can help to arrange tuktuk or a car rent with a driver and guide to take tour anywhere you want. We managed to explore all the Southern coast😊 and even Kandy and Colombo with them. Highly recommended, DREAM TOURS Dinesh and Dhanushka mobile numbers 0094779951582, 0094779412592. Very reliable and honest guys🙌🏻",positive

The property is nice though but the maintenance seems quite not up to the standard. Nice buffet and dining area. The beach view and pool area are very nice and attractive. the staff is very friendly and supportive all the time. Recommended for day outings.,neutral
"The Hotel is beautifully located by soft beaches and lapping waves. It's a luxury hotel in the spectacular south coast of Sri Lanka. Sprawling expanses of green fauna. Rooms are amazingly equipped with all the needed amenities of comfortable bedding, clean towels, bath robes, tea and coffee stations, private varandas and balconies, study niches and comfortable sofas etc. Food and beverage department is fabulous. Array of variety and quality on buffets for every meal. Several action stations to delight the taste buds of any guest. International cuisine buffets are spread out with fabulous presentations and garnishing. Salads, soups, breads, courses, pastas and meats, seafood and local treats of hoppers, puttus, strings and rices with fresh vegetables and fruits. Deserts and cakes are also amazing in flavour and variety. Executive chef Kamal, Food Beverage managers of Sudarshini and Nipun, with stewards of Dulangljani, Tharaka , Hanshana and the entire team of cooks, chefs and attendees were fabulous . They are couteous and diligent and prompt. They provide personalised care. Front office staff are also very warm and welcoming. We were greeted by a blend of spices and fruit juices and very quicking check-in procedures. Beautiful room was assigned with a view of sprawling lawns and beaches. Two large pools, Jacuzzis and well equipped gym were also available. The animater Raju does a fabulous job with Water Aerobics and volley ball and personalised guiding. His services are indeed a hallmark of attraction to the Hotel. The entire team under the capable leadership of managers showcase the excellence of Sri Lankan Hospitality. Well done Heritance Ahungalla. Will recommend your services to anyone I know.",positive
"As a well travelled guest, Heritance Ahungalla was one of the worst hotels I have been to. My friends and I arrived at the hotel after a long day, expecting the welcome they advertise. But we were greeted with nothing and yet I noticed the foreign tour group next to us at the hotel were getting a great welcome. The foreign guests were given a welcome drink in front of me and even when j was checking in, nothing was really done. This was extremely disappointing to see as their attention was on the foreign guests, even though the hotels are kept afloat by locals even in times of crisis. In a sense, it felt as if I and my friends were purposefully ignored at the welcome to focus on white people. Next, the rooms were OK and clean with the needed amenities. The pool was ok and the environment was relaxing and calm. But the Jacuzzis are broken and one was unusable. This really dampened the experience. Thirdly, the buffet. The food experience was TERRIBLE. I stayed ful board for 2 days and the food was the same everytime. There was not much variety and so, it was really disappointing. At one point during lunch, I found MOLD in my food!!! The same night during dinner, my friends and I ate carved roast pork and the meat was rotten. It smelled bad and when I ate a bite, it was so rotten and I had to throw it away. The breakfast buffet had some diversity and was enjoyable. The staff is nice and accommodates our wish. The bar makes a really good cocktail called the green pool. Other than that, it was a poor experience. Serving bad food to guests and ignoring local guests to focus only on foreign guests was what made me write this review. I never badly review anyplace I travel to unless its horrible, like ahungalla was. It did not serve a purpose to my business trip either. Would never visit again.",negative
"This was the 4th time we visited Heritance Ahungalla for the year 2023,we have been continuously been handled by Ms. Sunethra who never fails to surprise us on each of our visits. She is always prompt, friendly, courteous and very professional in her approach, she is one of the main reasons we keep on coming. Waruna at the restaurant is a busy Bee efficient as can be, always smiling and never has ""No"" in his vocabulary. Such a lovely site to meet during the meals. Rukmal , Housekeeping is also very friendly and very helpful, and attends to your every need. He is a very talented individual who can make any kind of animal using towels. Being a former Cinnamon Hotels and Resorts Employee I am amazed at how Aitken Spence Hotels has treated me and my family, it's truly touching. Thank you so much Sunethra and the team in every department for all the memories you have given us, we will be back 0ne last time before we leave Sri Lanka to say bye to you all. The food this time was mouth watering and the best after some time, congratulations to the new Chef. Well done. Wishing the whole team, the very best always.... Keep the flag flying high !!!",positive
"A beautiful room with a view of the sea, but it is far from it, and the most beautiful thing is a towel that they form on a dog, an elephant, or a turtle There are two excellent workers whose job I loved rukmal and ronali",positive
"Nestled in an idyllic location by the sea, this hotel is a perfect choice for groups and families seeking a lengthy and memorable stay. While not all rooms offer sea views, the overall ambiance is sure to captivate guests. During our visit, the hotel was fully booked, but the efficient front office staff adeptly managed the bustling crowd. Despite being assigned a room on the second floor, which lacked a noteworthy view, we found the accommodation to be below the expected standard for a 5-star establishment. The culinary experience was a delight, with all three meals served in a buffet style. The food was undeniably delicious, although the service provided by the restaurant staff could benefit from improvement. Families travelling with infants may want to arrive at the restaurant early to secure limited baby seats during peak hours. An array of both outdoor and indoor sports activities awaits guests, promising entertainment and enjoyment throughout their stay.",positive
"Overall the experience at the hotel was exceptional. Check-in - It was quick and smooth Location - This beach hotel has direct access to a beautiful coastal area. Rooms - Very good. Only negative part was, there was no sea view for the Delux room that we stayed. Food - Heritance hotel chain has not dissapointed me yet regarding the food they offer. Their buffet was good. Overall - It was a very good experience from check-in till the check-out.",positive
"We just spent 2 nights at the heritance. We had a lovely stay. Lovely pool and fantastic beach. Comfortable room. Lovely bed. The food was amazing. Such an amazing variety of food for all meals. Something for everyone and so tasty. Amazing sea food. Different foods every meal as well. As always though the best thing about any hotel in Sri Lanka is the staff. Always so attentive and helpful. Special thanks to a few of the team. Room cleaner Saman - very friendly, caring and helpful. Food and beverages- nipun and sudharshini were very helpful. Front desk - Mithma and Bhanuka extremely helpful and so pleasant. Restaurant - Nelka. Looked after us so well. Made us special cups of tea for us at breakfast including a special Sri Lankan "" yard"" tea",positive
The hotel is very old and is very pathetic the bathroom really sucks the building is very old and needs high upgradation it's not a five star property at all that is Baba Adam ke Jamane ki hotel like Dharamshala the bathroom walls are without pain and that are insect and animal creatures in your room including Chameleon and dogs in balcony very cheap hotel never visit again and waste of time and money you will spoil your tour by visiting this hotel,negative

The buffet is fantastic, offering a wide variety of delicious options. The rooms are well-presented and provide a comfortable experience for guests.",positive
"It was the best family trip I have ever been on so far and our stay was very peaceful. Checked in 15 minutes before the regular check-in time and management does not rush for the checkout. The hotel staff is really nice to my kids and it was very nice to see that behaviour. Mainly the food is delicious and it had almost all varieties of seafood, vegetables, and meat. The hotel do have 02 large swimming pools and mini jacuzzi type for kids. Highly recommend this place for a stay and hope the staff will remain with the same standards.",positive

My wife & I went from England for a 5 days holiday to celebrate a special birthday at Heritance Hotel in Ahungalle. It is a superb hotel with friendly & helpful staff with smiling faces. Food was excellent with good choices. Room & bathroom was very clean and comfortable. Pool was excellent and plenty of deck chairs with new towels. Nice sandy clean beach was just few meters away from the pool. We were made to feel at home by all the staff. We are planning to go again.,positive

"We were unfortunate to stay at this hotel on a day that they celebrated the Earth Day in 2023. We love, encourage, and actively participate in similar programs. The problem was, how the hotel management went about the celebration and their lack of planning. Hotel management decided to shut all electrical lights in the downstairs lobby area, then lighted kerosene torches. There were so may kerosene torches lit all over the area (including bar, near pool etc.) and the smell was unbearable, air was unbreathable. Add 100C temperature and humidity to the situation and it was absolute hell. What was the point of this stupid show? They probably added more pollutant to the air by burning all the kerosene for few hours than the greenhouse gases emitted to generate electricity. Stupidity at its best was in display at Heritance Ahungalla on 3/23/23.",negative

"this is the 3rd time I have been to Ahungalla, sorry to say I found it pretty ordinary, definitely not 5-star anymore. Good: Friendly staff. Bad: Terrible buffet and food offering, pretty ordinary food repeated again and again. Not worth it. Though it is costly, hard even to believe aitkense runs this place. Cleanliness in toilets and bathrooms is not up to the standard. Pretty an ordinary set-up, not the hotel it used to be.",negative
"Located 10km north of the city of Ambalangoda, Heritance Ahungalla offers classy stay along a beautiful beach. It has two pools, one with two heated Jacuzzis and a friendly staff. We were warmly received by Ms. Mithma who showed us around and made us feel home. The room balcony had a magnificent view to the Indian Ocean and the beach. The food could have been better, but it was definitely above average. We will surely come back for another stay for the beach and the hospitality!",positive
"Well The overall experience is not bad.. The two Pools were clean, big and had a good time swimming.. But the Jacuzzi pools were not clean.. Was very unpleasant to get in.. staff is friendly and supportive, except the staff in the buffet area.. Its like they are annoyed with the guests who are dining there.. One girl poured water to the glass until its over flowed.. She apologised but ddnt have enough time to clean it for us she got occupied with something else.. I dont blame her, But the hotel management becauae it seemed like they were over worked the shifts.. Some of them were exhausted and unable to provide the service as expected by the guests paid for a pleasant dining time.. Poor service from taking away the finished plates to filling up the finished dishes.. Buffet was average in my opinion, food is good, considerable amount of variety was there.. but i hope they can improve a lil bit more when it comes to buffet and dining.. Apart from that the stay was satisfying.. We booked a premium delux room.. Which was spacious and clean.. But the bed was uncomfortable.. I expected for the bathrooms to be cleaner and more pleasant looking for a five start hotel.. Heard complaints from the guests in deluxe rooms.. So make sure to book higher rooms.. I recommend this hotel for a get away with avarage expectations.. Surely not upto five star standards specially compared to herritance kandalama.. The reception staff was very nice.. The check in was easy and quick.. Beach was clean.. Place is quiet and peaceful.. Just some improvements are needed to keep up the five star standards..",neutral

If any one plans any special event like a proposal or anniversary contact Mithma and she will get the job done perfectly Food was delicious and service also good. Got a big pool area and some good views,positive
"Driven by excellent previous experiences we had at Heritance Kandalama, we booked a 3 nights’ half-board stay at Ahungalla with similar expectations: that we will receive a service in accordance to a 5 stars hotel, customer oriented and with attention to detail. But unfortunately this was not the case. With the exception of the reception staff who was very friendly and efficient, the rest was below the average, especially at the main restaurant. On more than one occasion had to make exaggerated gestures to catch the waiters’ attention and had to repeat our order of water and or coffee during breakfast and dinner. The used plates were often not removed, so we either had to again make exaggerated gestures to get the assistance of a waiter or make room ourselves. On top of that, getting the food from the buffet was quite a stressful experience by having to dodge tables, chairs and people (it was way too crowded!). Likewise, we faced a similar situation at the infinity pool bar. Given that the waiter was taking too long to come –we opted for standing up and going to the bar too make our order. Then we had to do a similar thing to get the bill as well. It was also quite unfortunate that the bar from the guests’ pool was not operative and no equipment was provided to get a better use of the lovely beach (lounge chairs and sunshades). A real pity, we expected much more from what it used to be such an iconic hotel.",negative
"Had a wonderful stay at Heritance ahungala with the family. The ambiance food and hospitality was great. We really enjoyed the stay. The rooms were cozy and comfortable, bit old looking. Recommend this place for a family outing",positive

And a huge THANK YOU goes out to Sanduni (Front office manager), who helped us from the time we booked until the departure, thank you from our hearts that you took so good care of us during our stay at Heritance Ahungalla. Looking forward for our next stay here.",positive
All the staff were very helpful and hospitable. It was nice to see the avurudhu uthsavaya and the staff getting everyone involved. The food and the room was also fantastic. I also used the spa during our stay and it was an absolutely relaxing experience. Thank you so much to Dilsha for constantly checking up on us and being a wonderful host with a kind soul. Also thank you to Nalin at the poolside bar and all the restaurant staff for their amazing service. We are looking forward to coming back next time.,positive
We had a very good experience at this hotel. The staff were really friendly especially Ms Dilsha. She was very helpful when ever we met her . And they had an Awurudu event which was well organized . The hospitality of the staff was very good and I have not seen in any other hotels as of now. The food was also very delicious . The swimming pools are awesome . The room was also very spacious and comfy. Overall 5 star rating for this beautiful hotel . It’s very child friendly too. Will be visiting this place again for sure .,positive
"It has been lovely stay at heritance ahungalla, staff is very friendly and kind, specially Dilsha has been very helpful. I will definitely visit again. Many thanks to the hotel staff! And yaasss food was amazing!",positive
Good service Friendly staff Good view Actually in this hotel give the best service to us and it's giving good view to us and their giving different kind of services to help for us and try to satisfy them,positive
Very special place to relax and feel the sun and the ocean at its best. But nothing special around the hotel. But no problem to rent a bike and explore the Sri Lanka’s beauty by yourself. Special thanks to Manoi for room cleaning!,positive
"Sri Lanka has a lot of beggars, this place secures you from that. Service, food and rooms are great. My time spent here was very pleasant and relaxing. Altought, I failed to figure out if the beach is into the indian ocean or laccadive sea. In summary - great.",positive
"One of the best experiences i have had at Heritance hotels. Despite the low tourism wave and the situation of the country , heritance staff still managed to put a huge smile on our face with the wonderful service. Its the little things that matter. On the first 2 days there was no buffet due to low occupancy and my kids were quite disappointed. But the way the staff were catering to our needs we quickly forgot about the buffet. The swimming pool was amazing and what's more there was always a pleasant keen face watching over the kids. It really gave that little break to relax. Same on the beach. we always felt safe and happy during our stay here. The little Christmas choir by the hotel staff was quite cute. Mr Rukmal got a first hand squeals of delight from the kids with his artistic decorations in the room using towels and flowers. :-) Lovely stay and i cant wait to go back. Thank you Heritance Ahungala team for making our stay so memorable",positive
"Everyone in the staff is very polite and welcoming. We had certain issues with the room that was given to us on our arrival but as soon as we reported it, Dilsha and her team (sorry for not knowing their names) attended immediately and upgraded the room, which was totally beyond our expectations. The food was amazing as well. Rukmal had also done a fantastic job in preparing our room and his towel origami was truly gorgeous. All in all everything was just *chef's kiss*",positive
I was upgraded to a second floor premium suite which gave access to a quiet balcony that I could use to relax on - facing beach and hearing the sound of the waves. This room also overlooked a green area - enjoyed this. I would recommend booking a room in this side of the complex if you want to relax. Special call out to Sanduni - assist. Manger. She really turned my stay into something else. She and the Staff were so kind and thoughtful. Great hotel for morning and afternoon long walks on the beach… this was probably the best part for me. There is also a small beach bar nearby for something different. I swam in the ocean though accept it is not always possible - pending weather. A great stay especially for a family- I met some who really made the most of the swim facilities and well-cared for pool. But like many places in SL - the team are the most important and here are great.,positive
Our family had a very enjoyable holiday at Heritance Ahungalle and the facilities that were available to guests were excellent. The staff members were very polite and professional. They were very friendly too. Mithma in particular was very cheerful and friendly.,positive
Very nice hospitatlity. We were welcomed with a drink which was really nice. Mithma was a really nice staff here as well. She was very nice throughout my stay. The resort is very beautiful. Vegetarian options are also there. Loved your resort,positive
"From the get go 'Dilsha' from the front office and 'Tharaka' from F&B went above and beyond to make our experience super comfortable and memorable. The hotel is another work of art by 'Jeffrey Bawa' and has serenity written all over it. I remember visiting the hotel many times as a kid when it was known as 'Triton', before the 2004 Dec Tsunami. Apparently, it is the first 5 star hotel established outside of Colombo back in the day. The only downside was that the sea was always a bit rough, where we had to hold my 6 year old's hand at all times when near waves. The super serene 'Green Pool' surrounded by the most beautiful greenery compensated for this. The F&B section headed by Rasika is beyond commendable. After being exposed to a series of bland food at other hotels, our palates opened up with every morsal of food we experienced. Every type of cuisine had the right balance of flavours with most having a Sri Lanka touch to it. The deserts were fresh, juicy and authentic, from macroons loaded with nuts, chocolate biscuit pudding, gateauxs, cakes, mouses, wattalappam, chocolate puddings, creme brulés etc. The only property who served fresh crabs and tiger prawns in the buffet. we've been hotel hopping all the way from the north, eastern seas border and Beruwela and was yet to experience this level of freshness, authenticity and effort towards F&B. In short, the food was sooo good that it made me cry happy tears... A hotel with a true Sri Lankan soul, oozing with old school Sri Lankan hospitality is a must visit whether you're Sri Lankan or not! Can't wait to be back!",positive
"Our room cleaning service managed by Rukmal was very well done. He made sure every wish was fulfilled. The Hotel itself was unfortunately average, rather a 3 star hotel for european standards. Generally not the cleanest, but okay. Gym was small, old fitness machines (but okay too). The staff was extremely polite and friendly, sometimes they haven‘t been that service oriented as one would wish in terms of: you go to the reception for a certain matter and you have to Come Back again and again instead of them taking a note and reach out to the guest instead. This way the guest has to do the work and not the Hotel. It should be the other way round ( but we‘ve noticed that in other sri lankan hotels). They‘re trying, but Just have other Standards. Nice Beach and Pools, a Bit crowded Some days. Food ist average to Good.",neutral
Great hotel right on the ocean. Relaxation and opportunity forget about problems. Excellent service and friendly staff. Thanks for Rukmal and all staff for comfortable staying. I hope to come back someday,positive
Perfect and traditional hotel with nice nature to enjoy vacation and relax Delicious food and beautiful beach And comfortable room to rest With good service Kind and friendly staff definitely MITHMA,positive
We had a wonderfull stay at the Heritance Ahungalla in Sri Lanka. People are so friendly and do everything they can to make your stay as pleasant as possible. Special thanks to mister Rukmal who kept our room very clean. A very friendly person. Always a nice attention on the bed with the towels. He did very nice things with it. Thanks to the poolboys who took care not only of the pool but also of the sunbeds and parasol. Everyday fresh towels and sunbeds made up. Also a nice attention from the gardners who gave us fresh flowers every day. Also at the bar and restaurant you were always served with a smile. Great food and drinks. Very nice hotel with great rooms. Just outside on the beach Mister Pathmi can offer you some nice trips..he is an experienced guide and very reliable. Sri Lanka is a very special country with lots to offer and very kind and friendly people. Heritance Ahungalla and his staff were excellent.,positive
"Excellent service. Staff is very friendly and awesome. Dilusha who works around us given splendid service. Thanks dilusha & keep it up. All the very best for your future. Lunch, dinner n breakfast are all good.",positive
"The lunch buffet is not great, not much of a selection. Washroom is tiny and very uncomfortable to have a shower. Two beds are put together. Room 131 or any other corner room is not a good room. So try your best to avoid that room because it will ruin your stay.",negative
"We were at Heritance for 1 night stay but due to super hospitality provided by the entire staff we extended the stay for another day to enjoy & relax.... We stayed in a Super comfort family room which is very clean and well maintained too. Mr Sisira Senaratne - GM , Duminda - Restaurant Manager (The Best) gave a personalise attention all the time , Rasika - F&B Manager took care of us very well. Food was excellent , I would say Bit limited spread (8/10) but Very Tasty Food !!! My son loved the sea food !!",positive
"The Heritance Ahungalla is the perfect place to spend a great time at a wonderful sandy beach surrounded by countless palmtrees. Also the two pools are great, although we especially enjoyed the one a bit further away from the mainpool. Our room was ground floor and had a lovely terrasse with some sunbeds and the pool infront. It was a very peaceful and calm surrounding, the perfect place to relax and rest for a few days! We booked half-board, which was served in form of breakfast- and dinner-buffet. But don’t imagine a “normal“buffet, it was the most delicious and varied food we had of all the 7 hotels (all 4- or 5-stars) during our trip trough Sri Lanka! Very special thanks goes to the stuff of the hotel (from main-desk through pool-and garden-staff to housekeeping)…they made us feel very welcomed and all tried their best to make our stay such a perfect one! (f.e. decorating the room and terrasse with fresh flowers and funny little artwork out of towels - thank you to Mister Rukmal! - serving us fresh King Coconuts directly from the trees…) If you desire a snack or a drink there is a bar next to the main-pool which serves all day long for fair prices. For the ones who like to keep in shape and exercise during their holidays, there is a gym with some cardio-mashines and wheights to join (nicely cooled by the aircon). All in all for us it was a perfect place for spending 5 unforgettable beachdays in Sri Lanka after our roundtrip and before going back home to Austria! We would recommend Heritance Ahungalla also to our family and friends .",positive
"Our Room was everytime an Oasis of ""cool"" rest. Always clean and proper. The Towel animals always brought a smile in our faces. Fresh Fruits on the table were also very welcome. All toilets articles were always replenished. Thanks to our room staff Manoj. The pool environment are very welcome due the waves in the Indian Ocean ( sometimes tricky). The restaurants were huge and extensive, sometimes indescribable tasty ;-) This was a really great Holiday Trip",positive
"Overall experience was marvelous. Food was good, staff was friendly. I would like to come back again, we came here to celebrate our wedding anniversary and i was suprise with the room deco and the cake we received",positive
Food was good. Specially dinner and breakfast. Friendly staff. Spacious property with ample pool facilities. Had access to a properly maintained beach and the beach is clean. However rooms one side of the hotel need to be upgraded including the washroom.,positive
"It was a pleasant stay with good food, friendly and cooperative staff. Special mention needs to be made of Sanduni who was new to the place but extended very good customer service. Lovely weekend where we were able to relax and enjoy the wonderful beach and the hotel and traditional food.",positive
"We stayed 3 weeks here this time. Previously we have stayed here twice or more over the last 30 years and I have used the hotel long before that as an occasional place to eat or stay. It retains all the charm of the hotel which was designed by a brilliant Sri Lankan architect. The staff are superb and a happy bunch. Many of them have been there a long time. We had a room attendant (Rukmal) who we judge to be among the best we have ever had anywhere, and we travelled Asia extensively for work prior to retirement. The personal attention given by other staff was equally good. Food is good, up there with other similar hotels (we have stayed in many) though we now prefer b&b as three buffets a day are too much for us! There is a reasonable a la carte restaurant and we found two or three eateries on the beach within walking distance. Finally, we also liked having a room at the end of the hotel by a second, quieter, pool. All in all we recommend this hotel very strongly.",positive
"Super friendly people, super food, sea views, good rooms, overall superb. We spend 10 super super good holidays days. Live music, very nice and helpful managers, bartenders who were also very helpful. Manager change room to deluxe classes, over two floors, at no extra charge.",positive
"Hotel facilities & room conditions are very good. Meals also good. Pool area,hotel view is very attractive.Staff service is very good and specially mentioned GRE Miss.Mithma’s service is very good and she gave fully attention to us. But one thing want to mention, room cleaning process is not happy because of without informing us they done that. Without informing to clean the room is very bad rule because it is very harmful to our privacy. Please pay attention to that rule and management should discuss and change the rules without any harmful effects to guests.",positive
The room was tidy and spotless. The buffets were splendid. One of the delicious meals I've tried in star class hotels in SL. The staff was very friendly and attentive as well. Overall the experience was awesome and I will visit the hotel once again for sure.,positive
"We absolutely loved our stay at the Heritance. Food was amazing, all the staff were friendly and welcoming. Special mention to Rukmal who cleaned our room, he made extra effort and it was really special. Would definitely recommend this hotel.",positive
We stayed at Heritance Ahungalla and the staff were extremely helpful with making our stay as comfortable as possible. Rukmal our housekeeper made sure the room was spotless and always leaving the room with a friendly design as shown in the pictures bringing great joy to the kids. Dilusha from the restaurant made sure my son’s very specific dietary needs were catered to at every meal throughout the stay. I recommend Heritance Ahungalla for a memorable stay!,positive
Good service and friendly staff 👍 Environment friendly and we had a sefly.. Had a good holiday Supportive staff The green pool concept is superb where a gren view is given at a sea side hotel. This pool is rely calming and is the best place in the hotel!,positive
"Great location by the sea. Living in a Sri Lanka architectural icon (G. Bawa). Very good buffet breakfast and a la carte dinner. Super friendly, competent and helpful staff who could help me in any questions and problems Thanks to you, especially to Sanduni! Will come back!",positive
Irene Leigh and family met Mithma when we first arrived . She was very welcoming friendly and helpful Beautiful location . We have come to Sri Lanka as a family to celebrate our birthdays Mithima ensured we were comfortable explaining the hotel features,positive
We had an awesome stay at heritance Ahungalla. Good place to experience the beach atmosphere. The staff was amazing and super friendly. Special thanks to Mithma and Chathura for their great hospitality. Hope to visit again.,positive
We love the place. The staff is very helpful n warm. The place has Beautiful views. We would recommend the place to our family and friends. Looking forward for more fun . Special shout out to Mithma for guiding with smile.,positive
"Good hotel, everything is ok. Meal is perfect. Have some questions to room service. They don’t add toothpaste or brushes before you say about it. Pool is clean but water is a little hot in opinion. My rate 4.8 out of 5",positive
"The Heritance Ahungalla Hotel is a great and tidy place. The hotel staff cares about the high quality of service, starts from room service across the restaurant food. Especially room service (the guy named Rukmal) was taking care of tidy in our room every day, and provided us comfort all the time. Place with direct access to the beach, the ocean is rights next to the hotel. Fantastic, colonial style hotel. I give high marks to this place. Sincerely recommend!",positive
"We stayed here for three days in February 2023. We could not find any fault with the staff, food, rooms or general situation. Access to the beach was easy, although with two pools there was no need to leave the site if you didn't want to. Would highly recommend and would like to visit again.",positive
"It was a fabulous treatment while I was at pool bar area. Excellent hospitality and very good communication, I would like to come back again and again. I recommend to visit this hotel as a experienced guest",positive
He makes beautiful towel art in the room! The people that work in HERITANCE Ahungalla do so much there best to take care of the tourists and they are all very nice and kind...and the food is very good,positive
"We stayed here in January / February 2023. The hotel its self is a beautiful building and was immaculately clean and well maintained. as far as I could tell all the rooms faced the beach with either a balcony or terrace. Our room 219 was clean and well equipped with everything you would expect from a hotel of this standard. There are two pools one is a quiet pool where ball games etc are not allowed the other is for fun and games, the pool attendants are friendly and and attentive. There is also a reasonably well equipped gym and a spa which is really well priced. We found the staff to be so friendly and nothing was too much trouble every request was met with a smile and service was efficient and prompt. The food was very good although if I had one suggestion it would be to remember that not everyone likes spice in their food, my wife is one who does not and on occasions found her choices very limited, but then there was always cake!! To conclude I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough and should we decide to return to Sri Lanka (and I hope we do) we would certainly go back to Heritance.",negative
"We stayed here for two weeks and I would highly recommend this hotel. The staff went above and beyond to ensure we had the best holiday we could, and I only wish other visitors gave the staff the respect they deserve. I do hope that the management at this hotel realise how good and accommodating their staff are. Our room was comfortable, with an excellent shower, and always cleaned to a high standard. Monkeys on the balcony in the morning was an added bonus 😊 The food was amazing for all meals and we never tired of the food. Drinks were of a high standard. The cleanliness of the hotel, pool, gardens, was outstanding. We really couldn’t fault anything. Would we return - absolutely! Thank you Heritance Ahungalla for an making our first trip to Sri Lanka an unforgettable experience, and we look forward to returning.",positive
"🧖🏻‍♀️🧖🏼‍♂️💃🏼👰🏼‍♀️ We have visited in November 2022 during our honey moon. we had a great unforgettable experience there from the staff at the reception specially sweet “Tharindi” to the daily decoration by Rukmal❤️ of the room to the luxury of the bath and the amazing food. We especially wish to Recognize and Thank THARINDI , Tharindi treated us all royally each morning, like part of her family, especially on the morning she was called us dally for the breakfast 🍳 Thank You Tharindi 🌸",positive
"All the personnel we communicated were pleasant, polite, courteous while not importunate with tips :). Rooms are well cleaned, linen is fresh and new. Furniture is not shabby The hotel has very big garden to walk with many local trees (e.g. Fish Poison Tree, Pandanus Tree/False Pineapple Plant) Pool is large and has constant depth of 0.9 m except small square area with depth up to 2,7 m Ocean bottom is shallow and allows to enter the water even with quite strong waves; Restaurant has mostly European food with only a small corner with local spicy dishes. Dishes were different nearly all the week we stayed there. For some reason mango was never in buffet. Wine was quite expensive - 5 USD/glass. Local beer is not so - 2.2 USD/bottle",positive
"I really liked how Rukmal made toys out of towels, very cool! They were always different . Very friendly staff, and the room is always clean , nice and cozy! also, they always put things together and it's very good! Thank you, Rukmal",positive
"Heritance Ahungalla is always our first choice when I and my partner visit Sri Lanka. I have stayed in this hotel more than 20 times over the last few years and, there is nothing else in Sri Lanka to beat its architectural beauty, tranquility, beautiful sandy beaches, friendly staff and their hospitality, and great food choices. All our work stresses and worries just disappear into the thin air as soon as we walk into the lobby of the hotel for the first time. Friendly welcome from the staff and the glance of the hotel environment with the infinity pool and the sound of the sea waves set the tone for the rest of our holiday. We love to come to Herritance to celebrate Christmas and the New Year since they organise a fabulous dinner with amazing food buffet with ice sculptures and food decorations which is out of this world, dance shows, fireworks and music by a great band. This experience is heavenly under the stars with the sound of the sea. What is unbeatable in this hotel, compared to other hotels in Sri Lanka, is the friendliness and the quality of the staff who works their. This goes from the General Manager to all the managers, to the waiters who serve at the restaurant, to the cleaning staff, and to the pool staff. They are always their to do their best to make our stay a memorable experience. I would like to give a special mention to Duminda and Waruna at the restaurant who always made sure we have an amazing dinning experience. Rukmal, the towel artist, make fabulous animal figures with towels and surprise us every morning as we come back to our room after breakfast. Pool attendants are always there to prepare our sun-beds every morning. We love walking along the sandy beach in front of the hotel in the morning and also in the evening and enjoy the evening sunset and then dive into the pool for a final swim before getting ready for the dinner. One day we wanted to organise a special dinner on the beach for a friend and his family to celebrate his retirement. The staff went out of their way to organise this dinner with fabulous food and assigned dedicated staff to serve the food. It was an unforgettable experience. I recommend this for couples if you are interested in organising a romantic dinner or for any special events to mark the occasion. I hope to be back again in the summer to re-live this beautiful experience.",positive
"We went in for lunch buffet on Jan 01, 2023 and variety of the food is good. Buffet was priced at 6000 LKR per head. The service is poor though; we had to ask for the staff to clear the finished plates from the table several times, and one of the staff ignored the request for water and had to wait around to find a waiter and get some water. There were no staff when needed at the table.",neutral
"Ruckmal doing his work very good, and this animals made from towels is perfect, thanks a lot! He is very polite and every time helps us. There are not a lot of people who love their work as much as he.",positive
"Heritance Ahungalla has by far been one of the best hotels we’ve stayed at in Sri Lanka. From the cordial welcoming to the amenities, our suite and the delicious food, Heritance displayed peak service. The staff were hospitable and prompt to meet any requests and always adorned a smile. A special and heartfelt thank you to Dananja, Duminda, Sanjaya, Dinesh, Rebeca, Waruni, Rukmal, Kalinga and everyone else who we had the pleasure of interacting with. We’d also like to clarify that there was never a delay nor did the staff ever falter despite certain complaints having been made by other guests. We had a spectacular time and we’ll never forget the music, dance, laughter and joy we shared with everyone at Heritance. Once again, thank you very much and we hope to come again soon when we’re back in Lanka. Blessings for the New Year! - Carl Joshua",positive
"We've been holidaying at Heritance Ahungalle for around 10 years, and have always loved it. Unfortunately it's now in a very sorry state. I can no longer recommend it. The management is shoddy, and the staff barely trained. We faced a catalogue of bad experiences - long waits at check in, meals not being available until 20-30 minutes after advertised start time, wrong orders at bar, shoddy service .... and on and on. The swimming pools and beach are still excellent. But the rest has sadly been allowed to slip. Such a pity.",negative
"Best towel artist in Sri Lanka - Rukmal Surendra Clean, cozy room. Two big pools with comfortable sun beds. Amazing sea with huge waves and a clean beach. Good drinks in the bars and overall good service. 100% would recommend",positive
"It was an overall disappointing stay at Heritance Ahungalla. The hotel was fully booked during our stay, given the holiday season. The hotel staff was very nice and friendly. It is an old building and definitely needs maintenance, particularly the rooms. For a 5-star property, the room is small, and the toilet hardly has any space in it, which is not what you'd expect given the star category this hotel boasts about and when compared to other similar 5-star hotels and resorts in Sri Lanka. The quality of the extra bed in the triple room would possibly befit a 2 or 3 star hotel. On the other hand, the king bed in the room was very comfortable, and one of the pluses was the sea view from the room, which was amazing. The food lacked variety and if you are a vegetarian, stay away from Heritance Ahungalla. They simply don't cater to those needs, even if you make a special note of it. The lunch buffet was the worst of the three meals we had. This was brought to the attention of the chef and the restaurant manager, and they were most apologetic, but it was an overall bitter experience in the end at Heritance Ahungalla. On the contrary, the desserts were superb and delicious. Overall, our stay did not offer any value for money, so I would never visit or recommend this hotel.",negative
"We really enjoyed our stay at the Heritance Ahungalla on the 8-10 December 2022. Though it was the peak season, there were not many tourists at the hotel. Jananjaya made sure that we are well looked after and was very helpful. Facilities were great, all the staff members were very nice and attentive. Overall we had an amazing time and food was excellent.",positive

"Our short stay in this hotel and country gave us a very high impression staying in the Herritance. The hotel had a few repairs undergoing which did not disturb us what so ever. Tha staff were very friendly, good food and clean rooms. The General Manager was always present trying to fulfill needs from his guests. A special thank you to the Front Office staff Mr. Caldera and Mr. Ruwan from the Restaurant. The enlightment of our entire stay was the welcome reception from Ms. Trilishiya Thompsan. She gave us a short introduction to the hotel facilities and made sure that our stay was made comfortable. She works very professional. Thank you Heritance team. All the best",positive

"It was another remarkable stay at Heritance Ahungalla after so many years. we were there during the week end. super friendly staff with warm welcome in reception, nice and clean rooms and goods drinks at bar. An architectural masterpiece. You may have heard of it but to experience it is a different thing. A hotel built in alignment with nature surrounded by a sea. Absolute beauty. The surrounding alone makes a visit worthy. All the other aspects expected in a hotel is ticked beautifuly. Beautiful infinity pool is a plus. Food is great. Service is warm. Absolute recommendation in every aspect.",positive

Dhananja is very friendly, polite and did his best to make us comfortable which was beyond our expectations. Also Duminda Restaurant Manager and his crew for being such caring and thoughtful for our needs and offering their utmost service to our family that can't be any better than that. We would like to extend our gratitude to all the housekeeping staff, pool staff and security guards for the amazing job they are doing at Heritance..Thank you for the love you all have shown at our little one who missed it badly back home and we very well know that he dearly loved every single hug, thouch and kiss from almost every MAMA and NANDA at the hotel.

"Highly recommended hotel with great hospitality. Each and every staff member is very keen on their work and we had an amazing customer service. Hotel has big two swimming pools and we enjoyed a lot even in the heavy rains. Couldn't go to beach due to the bad climate, still the beach is really nice. Recommended to visit this place from November onwards which is the season for the down south. Food is average and didn't have much choices, but not bad. The hotel is very calm and quiet place with beautiful atmosphere. Will definitely visit again.",positive

THE HOTEL IS LOOKING VERY DATED AND IN NEED OF A FACE LIFT AND THE FOOD IS NOT UP TO 5 STAR DINING, THE MENU WAS QUITE LIMITED, BREAKFAST MUCH BETTER THAN EVEING MEALS. VERY QUIET WHEN WE WERE THERE SO NO ATMOSPHERE OR ANYTHING TO DO WITHIN THE HOTEL, BUT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT WHEN MORE THAN 15 OUT OF 150 ROOMS BOOKED.",neutral

We have with our baby for 11 days at heritance. All the facilities and staff are excellent. Mr Namal and other guy gave excellent room service during our stay. Nice clean beach. Highly recommended this place.,positive

"Our family is happy to be in this hotel. We didn't expect that staff ,nature,architecture of hotel will be such wonderful. Restaurant is the best of all,delicious and beautiful dishes are succsesed all greetings. Especially, we want to admit from the staff, Nowan, he helps us very much in many cases. We loved our vocation,it is one of the best.",positive
"The hotel is nestled amongst an amazing surrounding with beautiful architecture created by Geoffrey Bawa. Valet service was provided upon arrival and greeted by lovely staff. We checked in to a lovely luxury room which was truly amazing. The food was delicious although the variety wasn’t ample. The hotel has two incredibly large pools, a badminton court, two tennis courts, table tennis and a pool table which we enjoyed which made our stay so much satisfying.",positive
"What a great experience. Wonderful surrounding. Great room service. Especially Dhananjaya , Duminda support us. Family really enjoyed. Last not least food... Mouthwatering. BBQ dinner is never forget.",positive
"Everything is perfect. Foods, so tasty. Luckily we had all meals buffet Styles. They have good variety of foods. Speacialy sushi, Buns sections, buriyani. Pizza is tasty, but pizza door is very hard. Restaurant staff very helpful. Rooms are very clean and comfortable. Room housekeeper Rukmal is veryhelpful. Both pools are superb. One swimming poll maximum deep is 2.75m. Wow.. in these days beach you can not swim. Its very rough. Hotel garden clean and very well maintain. We had a very good time in heritance ahungalla. Definitely gonna visit in future.",positive
It was a nice experience. Great atmosphere. Calm and quite. Lot of photo locations too. Nicely architectured building. Rooms were spacious and clean. Hospitality was great. Everyone took care of us. Specially Mr. Waruna at the restaurent was so pleasant and helpful. And also Mr. Rukmal who did the room service was really good. This hotel can be recommended for anyone who wish to visit.,positive
I have stayed at dozen of hotels in Sri Lanka. This was on the top of the list of best stays ever. My husband and I celebrated our first anniversary in this hotel. Staff was very hospitable including Ranil (Room boy) and there for every need of mine. Thank you so much.,positive
"Having booked into the Heritance Hotel in Ahungalla before, my expectations for the luxury resort were exceedingly high, and when I had the opportunity of visiting the resort once more on the 14th of August this year, my adoration for the lodge and its wonderful staff increased immensely. Not only was the location of the resort conveniently placed, but the resort-in itself had put security checks and guards in place to ensure the safety of its guests. I believe, that out of all the luxury hotels in Sri Lanka at the moment, the Heritance Hotel is one of the only-if not-the only hotel that is adapting to the economic crisis and the impacts of Covid-19 sufficiently; as seen by their exemplary service, the exciting amenities they offer and their laudable members of staff. As soon as we reached the hotel, we were greeted by the very hospitable, Mr. Dhananjaya. A true leader at heart, we were given a look at his impeccable organizational skills and his tendency to care for each guest that walked into the lodge. He was aided by an efficient group of staff members who served us a selection of beverages as we waited to settle down into our rooms; two luxury rooms and two luxury suites. The room I had stayed in was a luxury suite(Room 101) and it consisted of a very intriguing selection of reading material, a spacious and comfortable sitting area with plush chairs and pillows, two large television sets, a king-sized bed fit for-well-a king and a luxurious bathroom tiled Harlequin-style with a sound system; wherein a guest could either play music or the daily news. The bathroom in itself contained a jacuzzi and a separate shower on the side, accompanied by a small closet and a heap of neatly arranged, refreshing towels. The room had several, transparent doors conveniently positioned to lead to the niceties outside, e.g., one of the doors led right to one of the pools at the hotel. Moreover, my room was given a panoramic view of the hotel’s commodious tennis and badminton courts-adjacent to a ping pong table (not in view), both of which my family and I were able to utilize to its full extent. The leisure activities that Heritance presented us with, allowed my family and I to engage with one another and even formed my new-found love for badminton. The hotel didn’t stop there, as alongside one of its several different swimming areas, the hotel’s guests were welcomed by a gorgeous beach that encapsulated just how picture-perfect Heritance really is. I’m not one for morning walks, but members of my family would go on daily jogs or walks on the beach right after daybreak, in order to admire the way in which the sun would shine on the clear waters of the sea and the several little, harmless animals that would come out of hiding. In order to satisfy guests even further, the Heritance hotel also offered an air-conditioned gym, rejuvenating spa services-run by two lovely ladies, a ball room and-shockingly-a conference room, amongst other things I unfortunately didn’t get a chance to come across. The ambience of the hotel was magical. It made my family and I feel at home despite the fact that Ahungalla was quite an unknown location for us. The services we were offered one after another, amplified how amazing this experience was. Although he had no obligation to do so, Mr. Ajith would often help my family and I with small menial tasks and laundry services with a kind smile on his face, and he was quick on his feet, laboring hard to maintain Heritance's high standards of hospitality and service. Which he most definitely didn't fail to do so. Our hotel room was also blessed with snacks and warm cups of tea, specially delivered to our room by Mr. Nelka. Whether it was at the restaurant or at our hotel room, Mr. Nelka made sure to supply us with his commendable hospitality; going as far as to bring extra dishes to our dining table and even making us his signature 'Yard Tea', which is an absolute delight to taste. He managed to make our experience at the hotel ten times better. Our room was cleaned daily by Mr. Rukmal. Who was both, a great conversationalist and an expert at making stunning creations out of towels. Whether it was bringing us extra supplies or extra shuttlecocks for our badminton games, Mr. Rukmal ensured that our stay at Heritance would be extraordinary. Another very special aspect of Heritance Ahungalla, is that they know just how to engage their guests, whether its having different musical groups and musical artists play their work every night at the Hotel, arranging for staff dances, holding fun events like their volleyball tournament or even implementing their ‘little chefs’ program- in order to energize kids and keep them active. Moreover, the place is very animal-friendly and the animals themselves are very harmless. You’ll get to see monkeys, iguanas, puffer fish and even, adorable little cats. For the wild-life lovers out there, Heritance Hotel is the place to be! However, I do believe that the staff and the food at the restaurant are what really made the hotel what it is today; a haven of goodness. Mr. Tony was an old face who treated us just as well as he did during our last visit to Heritance. He was very quick and efficient with his services at the restaurant in order to fulfill our demands, and the efforts into which both Mr. Jacob and Mr. Jananjaya went to, to ensure that we received the finest dining experience, were to put it lightly -astronomical- as they were constantly looking for what a guest could want or need. Rest assured, we received exemplary care and service from them. The kitchen staff managed to produce delicious varieties of food, curating a buffet that was, unique, appetizing and very much exquisite. The set of desserts that they would present daily would come from all over the world; e.g., their heavenly Umm Ali-a bread pudding-esque dessert from Egypt. All the staff members at Heritance made us feel welcome and appreciated, but I would like to express my special thanks and gratitude to Mr. Duminda(Heritance's restaurant manager), who went above and beyond to make our stay incredible. Not only did he take special care of certain elderly guests, but he also provided my family and I with special dishes, advice on the hottest tourist spots and gave us a unique home-like experience. He was always looking out for a way to help us. Thank you! I hope that others are able to visit this amazing place one day!",positive
"My wife and I wanted a few days away by the beach to relax. Unable to go to the beach for nearly a year due to various factors in Sri Lanka. Very pleasant stay. Staff very helpful including and Udani, restaurant staff including the chef on call, pool & garden staff. Excellent room, food, beach and pool great. Would come again",positive
We celebrated our anniversary with a delicious cake provided by the hotel. Room services was satisfactory and food was fantastic. The reggae musician on Friday night was superb. Gym facilities was up to standard. Maintenance of the swimming pool needs to be improved but the pool staff was nice. Overall we enjoyed!,positive
"Thanks to the warmth and hospitality of the Udani, Rukshan, Tharindi and other staff at Heritance Ahungalla.

Heritance Ahungalla is my favourite hotel and I was able to go again post Covid in September 2022. The room was wonderful and the service was delightful. Buffet meals were delicious. The hotel has an iconic pool and sea view and the Reggae musician on Friday Night was fantastic. Love the Heritance brand!,positive
"A Really good weekend, i made my reservation at the last minute on a fully booked day, even though i was denied 1st hotel reservations called us and arranged everything as soon as a opening came, shout out for the reservations team for their fast response.

Excellent service rendered by staff. Continue the good work. Special thanks to the entire team. We had a wonderful vacation. Will definitely visit again. Food and service were beyond expectations Once again thank you all.,positive
This is the worst hotel I’ve ever stayed. Not compared to other 5 star hotels even just some random hotel with no star ratings is better than this. Our check-in was at 2.00 and we arrived at about 1.50 and the person there asked if we are starting from dinner and she said lunch will be closing at 2.30. once we went to get the lunch all the tables were full. they told us to wait outside till a table is available. we booked 2 sea view rooms and only view we got was pool. rooms were not cleaned properly. you cannot even walk barefoot on those floors. bathrooms were dirty and not properly maintained. we went to the pool at about 7.00pm and the person there told us the pool will be closing in 10 minutes. but when we asked before they told they close the pool at 8.00pm. the guy at the pool don’t know how to speak to people. after 10 minutes he came back and told us to leave. there was a lasagna at dinner buffet that smelled really bad. There’re so many other things and this hotel shouldn’t be a 5 star hotel. mainly the staff is very rude and they treat guests like they are staying for free.,negative
"My family and I visited this hotel for my dad’s birthday and I cannot even describe what a wonderful time we had. The staff was unbelievably kind and attentive and so sweet. They went out of their way to make my dad’s birthday a special one - from special decorations at the dinner table, complimentary birthday cake to arranging a special bedding. We were so touched. Special thanks to Varuna, Banduka and actually the whole staff. We will be sure to visit again soon! The smiles will not be forgotten!",positive
It was great and pleasure holiday at the hotel heritance ahungalla .This was my third visit ... The front office staff was so friendly and very kind .. The food was amazing... rooms was very clean and tidy.. I had a wonderful vacation with my family ... highly recommended to experience .. Rear Admiral Nishantha Desilva ( SLN ),positive
"2 weeks working at the Heritance in Ahungalla. The staff were fantastic, special mention to Rukmal the cleaner who left a different towel image / animal everyday on the bed and Rasika who helped with all the support for the workshop. The hotel has nice rooms, great pools and excellent food. The only downer is the plastics problem that Sri Lanka currently has, every beach had a lot of plastics including this one - despite the efforts of the staff to clean.",positive
"My 03rd visit to Heritance Ahungalla & the staff exceeded our expectations as always. Awesome masterpiece,friendly staff & scrumptious food. Thank you Dhananjaya for making our stay comfortable. Heritance Ahungalle is the BEST",positive
"It was our 02nd visit to Heritance Ahungalle & we loved it to bits & pieces. Exceptional hospitality & scrumptious food, its the BEST in down south. HERITANCE AHUNGALLE should be in every traveler's bucket list. Highly recommending.",positive
"This is my second time visiting the hotel. It is another masterpiece designed by Geoffrey Bawa. The hotel is very large, boasting an expansive garden with direct access to the beach. I was told we could observe turtles around 9 - 10 pm at night, which I unfortunately missed. The rooms are very clean and spacious, with balconies that give a breathtaking view of the ocean. The bathroom was also spotless. The hotel has two large pools that provide great backdrops for photos. The staff members are all very warm and welcoming. I would especially like to mention Udani, who was so helpful and friendly. She has worked at many of the Heritance hotels and had so many stories to share. We actually went there to celebrate my mother's birthday, but we did not specifically mention it to the staff. They had made a note of it when they checked us in and had arranged a beautiful and delicious surprise cake for my mother. I would like to extend my thanks to the chef as well as Sanduni and Rebecca, who arranged it for her. We were provided à la carte menus for all three meals as the guest count was low. But the food was more than any of us could eat, and everything tasted divine. I would also like to mention how kind the staff was as they had cleaned our car after seeing that there were some monkey droppings on it in the morning. Thank you for being an amazing hotel, and we would definitely visit again!",positive
"Stayed at hotel with my parents. Manager, front desk team (Lekha, Tharindu), head chef and restaurant staff (Rebecca, Saduni) went out of their way to make us feel at home and meet our needs. Rukmal did splendid job of keeping our room neat and tidy. Relaxing spot with friendly staff.",positive
"Hotel is very good! Nice staff, clean and good food. The ""tour guides"" at the beach are expensive and not reliable. Contact Eranda at +94 77 664 1538 for special and affordable tours. Very friendly Tourguide!",positive
Our family stayed for one day occupying 3 rooms!! Food was amazing and the room service was excellent! I have to specially mention Rukmal who served us! 5 Starts specially to him!! We are surely to be back!,positive
All the staff was very friendly and specially the housekeeping person Rukmal has done a superb job with our room. My kid was so exited to see the arrangement. Food was really good and they were very accommodating to our requests. All in all a good time spent.,positive
"Heritance Ahungalla was a lovely experience yet again, my third time here. The hotel staff was courteous and caring. Can't keep the prawn curry with roast paan outta the review, it was so so good. Last but not the least, Ranil for keeping our suite top notch.",positive
Good place to relax and enjoy. Good food and full of fun activities. Only 1 hour drive from colombo. Specially i should mention the room service and the cleaning staff were very proactive on their duties. During our stay housekeeper Ranil provides extremely high customer service. Thanks Imran Lye,positive
We have selected this hotel to celebrate our Wedding Anniversary . We were pleasantly surprised with their arrangements to celebrate our special day. We were given a complimentary cake also. The buffet was fabulous with the varieties of food. For the dinner there was a spicy prawns curry which was very tasty. Also the rooms were very clean and the staff is very friendly . Really enjoyed our stay there.. highly recommended for a getaway .,positive
"Excellent Aspects: The staff were extremely helpful. Honestly every single person went above and beyond during our stay. On the weekend they had some great activities for kids: Magician & Cook with Chef. The magician was excellent and quite talented. Room service does some amazing towel art. Good Aspects: The food was really tasty however being vegetarian the options were'good' not excellent. But they were ever willing to cater to us. Things To Note: The halls can be really slippery when it rains. I saw a guest slip n fall just in front of us. The air con works well but causes a tonne of condensation on the floors, especially if you turn it off.",positive
"The room was very clean and the people very friendly and helping. Every day the room Was cleaned and fresh towels. Wenn there was a problem with the room, the came immediatly and were helping. The noun and Buffet where very good",positive
"I want to say thank you for this special stay in this hotel. It was a plesure to spend the vacations here. The very nice hospitality of the people in the hotel is remarkable. The food (incl. Beverage service) is perfect, delicious and varied. The location is central and the direct connection to the beach is wonderful. A big thank you to our personal room service - RANIL - who cleaned and organized our room so perfectly good and gave our vacations the best feeling for our first travail in Sri Lanka. Thank you again and see you soon. Best regards, Josi and Sebastian (Germany)",positive
"Its a beautiful hotel and the staff are masters of their trade. From the front office to catering to housekeeping everything works like clockwork. Given everything that is going on in SL at the moment the hotel maintains the same high standards like it has always done. Well done ! Great food, great hospitality, truly a five star experience.",positive
"Very nice view with Indian ocean and food is delicious and exquisite Staff is very friendly, hotel is quiet and peaceful , rooms are well maintained and nice interiors,overall nice experience ,hoping to come again",positive

"The food selection is amazing and tasty 😋 Very clean rooms and the staff are so welcoming and helpful. Beautiful towel art done by Rukmal, very impressive 😊 and decorated so nicely with flowers. He made us swans, a crocodile and a cute elephant.",positive
"The hotel we originally chose was cancelled and hence we chose this hotel as it was our second choice and what a great choice it was. The island is amazing and we had many trips sorted by Siri whom we met on the beach - I would highly recommend him for any trips. We were there for Valentines night and my wife's birthday. On valentines day we dined on the beach and the experience was amazing, whilst the hotel sorted a cake for the birthday. Food is excellent, room excellent and the staff superb. Special mention goes to Vindya, Duminda, Sugath, Jananjaya who all looked after us throughout our stay.",positive
"The staff really made me and my family feel at home by helping me at anytime even when I missed breakfast they still took care of me by bringing room service. Specifically RUKMAL is one staff member you can count on for a first class service, he provided many options whenever I requested anything and was very friendly, he was one staff member among many other great staff members that helped me out whenever I was in need of anything.",positive
"Although the occupancy rate was low, the hotel is still maintained vey well. Meals were all À la carte and they were all of very high quality. The personalised service of the staff was beyond expectations. I was extremely satisfied with the two days spent at Heritance Ahungalla and would recommend to visit at this time if you wish spending a calm and quiet holiday in 5 Star comfort.",positive
"We stayed in this place for two nights and founded this hotel very good. We loved amazing food, friendly staff,calm and clean environment. The hotel has two swiming pools and it is near Indian ocean. Good place to relax in Sri lanka.",positive
"From the entrance, we felt like very familiar. The reason was the staff... They were very friendly and caring... The rooms were comfortable and clean... The food was good... We can recommend this place if you visit ahungalla.",positive
We were 6 of us looking for a new experience with a chain of hotels. We decided on Heritance Ahungalla even though our first thoughts were with Kandalama. But I must say from the time we checked in till we checked out it was a fabulous and unprecedented treatment we got from all the staff at Heritance Ahungalla. We were awed by your staff's concern and attention to all their guests as we were made to feel exta special where ever we went! Our biggest surprise was getting a buffet which the children appreciated so much and the service was par excellence. We actually felt pity in leaving the hotel as we were treated so well by everyone from the room service staff to the restaurant staff who took good care of us and made us feel at home and very special. All our requirements were met so much care and professionalism. But most of all there cared to do it with all their heart which we Sri Lankans are known for and hadn't seen in a long while. Thank you and we will return soon to your wonderful hotel that we would like to call home away from home. Thank you!,positive
"Had a very pleasant stay at Heritance Ahungalla. Restaurant staff went above and beyond in their outstanding service, special thanks to Jananjaya. Food was delicious.Highly recommended. Thank you to all!",positive

"Really nice place to have a family holiday. Delicious food, friendly staff, clean room. The staff is very responsive and caring. The room was spacious, clean and had a great view. Highly recommended...",positive
We stayed at Herittance Ahungalla for 2 nights and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Beautiful hotel well managed and run. Food was excellent. Staff were very friendly. Live music in the lobby was an added attraction. The room was outstanding. We wish we spent more time there. Will definitely be back,positive
"The Heritance hotel is beautiful and the staff are amazing, very friendly and did everything to make our stay special. Some building work is currently going on at the hotel but as it’s low season this was ok. Sri Lanka is beautiful and the country needs more people to visit. Fully recommend this hotel.",positive
"We have toured multiple cities in Sri Lanka, but so far this is our favorite local hotel chain. The interior is well thought out, the rooms are very clean and well kept. The spa is just what we needed and more, and the staff is very sweet and welcoming! The food is also amazing and clean. Guaranteed Best first time experience and won’t be our last!",positive
"The staff are amazing and very attentive. Special thanks to Jagath who went above and beyond to look after us. Most mornings, the gardener gave me flowers which was a lovely touch. It could be a nice hotel however it is very dated and needs some tlc. The hot tubs did not work and to our knowledge it was at least 4 weeks. The bar could not cater for cocktails until I made a complaint and they ran out of diet Pepsi. This is unfortunately not a 4☆ hotel. I think the worst part was the building work that was started with no notification, and them having to cordon off part of the pool bar area. There are pros and cons with this hotel. It is very far from the airport and you need transportation to visit anywhere. Like all hotels, they overcharge for trips. If you do visit this hotel and wish to go on trips, go to the beach and see Siri. We used him for 2 weeks and you can't get better. Amazing person and very knowledgeable. I would think about returning however, not until it is updated and worthy of a 4☆ plus",positive
"We stayed in this hotel in down south possibly for the forth time. It still maintains the standards of care and service. This is one of the very early creation of Jeffry Bawa, the legendary architect in Sri Lanka. Food was excellent and the staff were helpful.",positive
"This is one of our many visits and the first after covid pandemic. Still allure of Bavas creation stands strong. The food, the rooms and the hospitality was great. The service was the highlight and the classical good Sri Lankan hospitality was maintained Our luxury rooms were comfortable and classical . The gym was good",positive
"We booked a double room and from the time of our arrival it felt like we were in a quarantine facility. For a beach hotel that should exude a relaxed vibe, the entire entry was roped off!! We were taken over by a hostess from the time of arrival and directed like school children - ""stay here, do that, etc"". Walked through an xray scanner which is quite okay but which was the only entry. Ordered to sit down, ordered to wear masks etc. It is a really open space and we are all triple vaccinated. The elevators were not working. The room was good but was definitely overrun with moisture issues. ""Double"" meant two single beds pushed together!! Tried to order a cocktail in the bar but was told that because of ""supply issues"" only Arrack cocktails were available. Had dinner in the coffee shop and were served french fries cooked in rancid Coconut Oil!! When asked why, was told ""supply issues"". I was offered a replacement but wondered how was I going to receive a replacement if there was indeed a supply issue?? Was a victim of overt racism at breakfast. As a Sri Lankan, I was singled out and ordered to wear a mask!! At a buffet!! All the other non Sri Lankan guests were exempted including my partner. I did complain to the restaurant manager who was very receptive and apologetic. Tried walking on the beach - impossible. All the vendors and touts just follow you around and obviously there is no control from the hotel. Overall a disappointing experience",negative
"My family stayed two nights in the hotel. It was a memorable experience considering the exceptional service, kind staff and the facilities that it provides. My children loved the two large pools, the badminton court, table tennis and the beautiful beach. The food was excellent. We highly recommend this hotel and are definitely considering coming again next time. Prasantha Hapuarachchi",positive
"We enjoyed our stay at Heritance Ahungalla (during Avurudu weekend) which is immaculately kept. This is my fourth visit and enjoyed as usual…The room was very spacious overlooking the sea - the bed was very comfortable. There is always stock of tea, coffee, water in the room along with the mini bar. Pools are fabulous, both me and my daughter enjoyed. Staff are lovely and service is excellent. Especially Dhananjaya who is very supportive and take care of us at entire stay….. We enjoyed sun bathing on the beach and had a perfect morning walk. The buffet restaurant is excellent with extensive choices. All three meals were excellent and more choice in the main buffet restaurant. Overall superb stay…Pasan_Abeygunawardane",positive
I had a great stay at heritance. The staff were very accommodating and food was enjoyed. The weather was not the best when I stayed so I didn’t get to enjoy the pool as much as I would of liked but it was still very relaxing in the gardens and a nice walk on the beautiful beach. The room was gorgeous. Bathroom was huge and beds so comfortable. Definitely will stay here again if I’m in the area!,positive
"My partner and I stayed here towards the end of a luxury tour of Sri Lanka. It was the perfect place to end our stay, and the hotel is brilliantly run with superb service in challenging times given the economy. The setting is absolutely idyllic and stunning, right on the beach, with well-maintained pools. The staff could not have done more to help us, and I would like particularly to praise Rukmal who provided excellent housekeeping services. We returned to find our bed scattered with red flowers and the towels fashioned into swans! He always attended very efficiently to any issues we had. I must also mention Issuru and Athika in the restaurant, who both went out of their way to provide really top-notch quality service. All those staff deserve a salary raise and a promotion! Please tip the hotel staff well, they deserve it. We had moved to the Heritance from an inferior hotel nearby into which our tour operators had unwisely placed us, as it was an entirely different category from our previous five star luxury hotels around Sri Lanka. The Heritance was our saviour for our last few days, as it was the perfect place to relax with superb service. We look forward to returning to the hotel, and cannot recommend it highly enough. The manager is also excellent, and he is a constant presence around the hotel, always checking that everything is satisfactory for every guest.",positive
"We have just enjoyed a relaxing time at this hotel celebrating our wedding anniversary. The hotel provides a beautiful setting on the sea front with lovely gardens and two large pools clean and well maintained. The Pool staff are very attentive to guests needs when using these facilities. Whilst the local area is very quiet this is a good location from which to explore the South Western coastline of Sri Lanka and access to a number of popular tourist spots nearby. The staff at this hotel have been superb, eager to please guests and happy to ‘go that extra mile’ to make visitors feel welcomed. We must give special mention to the following staff for their hard work and for making our stay feel extra special - Jacob, Asitha, Jagath, Nimsara and Sinari. A big thank you also to Lokusuviya for his hardworking cleaning and tidying our room each day and the really friendly young man serving in the hotel gift shop! The food served in the main dining room was of a good quality and always offered a good choice of different Asian and Western dishes. We also took advantage of the drinks and snacks regularly available at the Pool side snack bar! During our stay here we were lucky to enjoy all the festivities and additional events organised by the hotel to celebrate their special New Year. We booked several trips during our stay with Rasika, a local guide, who can be found at the edge of the hotel/beach front. He offers good value and local knowledge/experience and we were happy to support local people rather than the large companies. We were fortunate to enjoy the Elephant Safari at Udawalawa, the Madu river cruise, a day trip to the Galle Fort town and spent time at Hikkaduwa swimming with the large Turtles. We also arranged to see the iconic Stilt Fishermen, the rather moving Tsunami Museum and spent time relaxing on the lovely beach at Unawatuna. Thank you again to ALL of the hardworking staff at Heritance Ahungalla hotel. We have really enjoyed our stay here.",positive
"We stayed for 10 days here, I booked 3 rooms and we had a wonderful time. The rooms were clean and very comfortable the beds and pillows were so soft which is a treat when abroad. The food was good and very tasty, the people in Sri Lanka are struggling to get some of the essentials but did the best they could which was amazing. The staff were very accommodating and super friendly. The pools were very clean with lots of beds available. The beach is not private but beautiful and a stones throw away from the pool. There are people selling their products at the entrance but if you are not interested and say no they leave you alone, if you want any trips speak to Siri he is stood by the fence and was amazing. He was friendly, kind and his price was fair his driver Bernard was a lovely man so I highly recommend these two. We went to the elephant safari, the turtle sanctuary he also took us to a great seafood restaurant for lunch in Hikkiduwa. If you want to walk along the beach for the best king prawns you will ever taste walk to the right of the beach to Villa Thotupola Siri will show you 😂 it is a stunning cove with a family run place which was excellent food, we ate there twice. To the left of the beach is jungle beach bar again lovely food for lunch. We were advised not to walk along the beach at night so you need to be careful but that is understandable. The extra treat with this hotel is the dogs who live on the beach and visit daily with their wagging tales we loved this part of our holiday and saved a few sausages from breakfast, so if you are not dog friendly then Sri Lanka is not for you they are everywhere you go.",positive
"Mr Nuwan Sasanka and his team have to be the most friendly, warming, assertive team I have ever known. They work brilliantly together and ensure all customers, especially my family, are 100% satisfied with what they recieve and how they are treated. Mr Nuwan Sasanka brilliantly conducts himself and his team and is an inspirational leader by example. Our stay here was made as brilliant as it was all down to the impeccable service and friendly & joyous nature! Thank you Mr Nuwan and all his team for making our stay fantastic! The Chapple Family.",positive
This hotel was amazing! the staff are incredibly friendly and go over and above to make your day special. The rooms are modern and clean. The food is good with lots to choose from. Family friendly with 2 large pools and beech. They made our daughters 8th birthday unforgettably amazing! we can not wait to return next year!,positive
"Hotel is lovely! Setting is beautiful! Staff are so friendly and helpful, including Rukmal who looks after our room. Cleaning is of a high standard and we always come back to surprise towel ‘animal’ on our bed! Food is great- plenty to choose from! Loving our stay so far!",positive
"Great hotel, small, but have some spare for walking after good dinner, good food, breakfastquite usual,but dinners was very good, especially Rukmal our cleaning service was absolutely fantastic, with surprise every day, made our kid happy every day with his towel art. Everyday in our room number we have found some funny guys made of towels.",positive
A very nice hotel with good atmosphere and friendly people. The food is with variety of choice and good quality (European and local kitchen). Rooms are clean and nicely decorated by Mr.Rukmal who is a master of towel art. The several pools around the hotel are beautiful and well maintained. We enjoy the holidays a lot.,positive
"• I am a frequent guest at Heritance and for the second time in 2022. My holiday joy and that of many other guests was spoiled by the majority of holidaymakers from two other countries. Her reckless and disrespectful manner caused anger among the other guests and hotel staff. Parents didn't take care of their children. The children took over the restaurant as a playground. Eating behavior unacceptable, ……. .Pool was polluted with sand. The employees tried everything to change this situation, but only met with rejection. Not exactly motivating. It's over now!!!!!!!!!!!! From March 31st no more guests will come from these two countries. The Heritance Ahungalla will shine again in its former glory. Come to Heritance Ahungalla and enjoy unique Sri Lankan hospitality nestled in the hotel's paradisiacal setting. I wish you an unforgettable time.",negative
"The hotel looks lovely and the rooms are very nice - large, airy and tastefully furnished in a modern take on traditional. Wonderful big comfortable bed, excellent rain shower, big flat screen TV, minbar, generous safe and covered private balcony. Public areas are open plan and also look very nice - until you spot the package operator signs & programs, hear the scream of children in the pool (right beside the only bar & lounge) and realise the predominant language is Russian. Service is hit and miss - there are some excellent staff who cannot do enough to please, but there is also a lot of inexperience and a shortage of staff for the number of guests - leading to some extremely poor service experiences (eg. Wine ordered at dinner not arriving until after dessert; dirty plates left on tables for long periods; tables not properly cleaned between use; buffet dishes not replenished; etc.) The food quality in the buffet is poor - tough cuts of meat, over cooked curries and left out/not refreshed very often. Even at the fresh food stations the ingredients were not top quality and over cooked - and at best all the dishes are luke warm. Breakfast was no better - some good curries, but otherwise heavy doughy croissants, ‘butter’ that was in fact margarine, a couple of cheap jams, limited selection of fruit and one person cooking eggs and another cooking hoppers for the 100s of guests. To round it off - the majority of the wine list was unavailable (excuse being difficulty with supply chain due to pandemic - but the other hotels on our tour hadn’t suffered the same problems), as were a number of items on the pool bar snack menu. The sl a carte restaurant and the other bars / coffee shop weren’t open either. Definitely not a five star experience.",negative
"We visited Heritance at the end of our tour of Sri Lanka. Purpose of visit was to celebrate our daughter's birthday. Our daughter had a fabulous birthday thanks to Jananjaya, Nipun and management who were so wonderful. Thank you so much for making our stay so memorable. Your staff are an absolute credit to you. They go above and beyond. We are truly grateful for your kindness. Sharma family",positive
"Consistent with the other recent reviews we were scheduled to stay at the Heritance for the final three days of our SL tour. However, we checked out after the first night. On a positive note, the room was clean and recently refurbished. The food in the optional al à carte restaurant was also good and the restaurant staff very friendly and efficient. On the other hand, the hotel is extremely large with many guests on “all you can eat” inclusive deals. This created a very different feel to other hotels we stayed in. The staff were a mixed bag. Some were polite and others simply ignored you. The grounds were somewhat scruffy and the water in both pools was opaque suggesting a problem with algae (see photos). The adjacent beach was full of litter and hawkers. Having decided to check out were asked for feedback and this was positively received. Unfortunately, this didn’t result in any gesture of good will and we paid the full bill for drinks etc. In summary, the hotel is adequate if you want to eat, drink and sunbath cheaply but it does not provide the experience consistent with other hotels in this class.",neutral
"Heritance Ahungalla is next to a Lovely beach, and has a great view, nice pool and thanks to Rukhal and all the other colleagues for making our stay so nice with great service. Much appreciated by us!",positive
"Arrived after an amazing tour to be greeted with a poor reception by hotel staff.Not shown to the room ,two green pools full of algae unable to see bottom of pool.room was sufficient but superficially cleaned, no welcome fruit staff rude , lazy as this is an all inclusive for other countries paying guests are ignored but they stillcharge service charge. Lack of sunbeds but pool staff reserve for tipping guests. Children allowed to run wild everywhere even in the restaurants. Covid restrictions dismal and guests not challenged despite Sri Lanka still insisting on mask wearing. Only one bar open despite advertising all facilities available…. Avoid this hotel as a well travelled guest this deserves at best a 3 star rating.",neutral
"The resort exceeded our expectations. The rooms were spacious, spotlessly cleaned every day. There are two large pools, one of them more relaxing area, the one close to the lobby was more for kids. The food was delicious with a great variety of sea food every day. Entertainment and music every day in the lobby bar was at good level too.. The staff is extremely friendly and polite. The beach is huge and almost empty. The waves are big so a bit difficult for the kids to be in the sea.. We were four friends and all of us very satisfied. A special thanks to Mr Dhananja, Guest relations in the lobby",positive
"This is our first visit to Sri Lanka and we are very glad that we got to this hotel. very clean hotel and friendly staff. cleaning in the rooms at a very good level, special thanks to the cleaner Rukmal and the quality of work!",positive
"We stayed one night in February 2022 at Heritance Ahungalla. The room was very spacious and clean. We requested a quiet room and the hotel gave us a room which is far from the central pool area, facing the second pool. It was indeed very quiet. The welcome fruit was nice touch. The staff there are very nice and you can ask all kinds of questions. Buffet for dinner and breakfast had both good selection. You can taste authentic Sri Lankan food there although there are many western dishes. We sat in the garden at the dinner as it was quieter. The beach is wonderful and great place to watch sunset. The pool in the center was bit clouded but the second pool was not soo bad. If you want to experience Bawa hotel, this is another wonderful resort.",positive
"Hotel stuff showed us how the real warm hospitality looks like in Sri Lanka: very friendly , always smiling, very helpful and care about our needs 🧡 cuisine is very diverse and delicious 🧡 we’ll return 🧡🌸",positive
"Stayed at the Heritance Ahungalla after a weeks safari and whale watching. Our suite was very good, thanks to Namal for keeping it nice and clean, and the staff were all excellent. Friendly, helpful and always there for you. A welcome break after all the travelling. Gary & Chrissie Bickerton",positive
I would like to give a special thanks to Rukmal who took great care of us. I would definitely give the property and it’s services a 10/10. The food is amazing plus you will love the pool and the view from here.,positive
"I have such mixed feelings about this hotel but I’m confident in saying that this is not up to the standards of a 5 star. We stopped here for the last week of our 2 week trip to Sri Lanka for our honeymoon and on arrival to the hotel from the lobby/main gates it looked exceptional! On arrival to our “deluxe” room we were instantly disappointed. The room apparently had just been refurbished which I found really hard to believe. The shower was covered in limescale and the room was tiny. After a bit of a battle we were finally allocated another room. This room was slightly bigger but the bathroom was once again the bathroom was again covered in limescale, half decorated, very basic and we couldn’t see anything deluxe or 5 star about it. Earlier in the week we stayed in a deluxe room at a sister hotel ‘Heritance Kandalama’ and the room there had an amazing view, whirlpool bath & amazing decor… so as you can imagine we were really disappointed with this room. I’ve attached a couple of photos for reference too. The food was really really good at the buffet and snack bar and we thought the verity of alcohol provided on the all inclusive was good. The staff were friendly but there wasn’t enough staff and they couldn’t keep up with how many people were there. I personally wouldn’t recommend to anyone looking for luxury to stay here and agree with the below comments that this is an equivalent of a European 3 star hotel. Finally, it seems that the management and staff prioritise the returning customers which is such a shame as if they put the effort in to new customers (especially ones who have spent a considerable amount of money on honeymoons) too along with a few touch ups, they’d receive better reviews.",negative
"We stayed at heritance ahungalle for a few days on our visit to Sri Lanka The staff were extremely helpful in particular Duminda the restaurant Manager, Rukmal from house keeping and restaurant staff Varuna, Nelka and jananjaya. We were impressed with Duminda. He is very knowledge and made our stay very enjoyable. Rukmal has a special talent of creating animal motives out of towels. We felt very special. The staff are a credit to your organisation We will visit again Kumar and Elsie. Sydney Australia Clara Thattil Colombo Sri Lanka",positive
"I don’t mind staying in 3 star or less and judge them on that criteria , this is the type of hotel I object too , pretending to be a 5 star when it clearly is not . This is a recently updated 3 star at best First Pros Good location , right on the ocean , nice pools that faces the sea , rooms are adequate . Couple of excellent staff , housekeeping and the lady at the buffet Cons Bear in mind this is a 5 star hotel ( allegedly) Two hot tubs , one uncovered and has foot of water the other boarded over with no sigh of life . Broken paving stones by the second pool Old and tired towels at the pool Sun beds all peeling Blinds that come down in poor weather to protect the hotel are shredded and broken Rusty bin in bathroom, Paint peeling in the shower No USB points , Plastic seal on the bedroom shutter coming away Service is sooooo sloooooooooowwwwww Asked about ice cream at the 5 star buffet and told its not included . Sulky waiters 5 star gym is old, 8 year old machines , no matts , What I find suspicious is that all the glowing reviews mention nothing about the tiredness of the place and they are generally written by people with less than 5 reviews to their name , hmmmmm Only here for a couple of days but would be very angry if I had booked a week at a “5 star hotel” to find this",neutral
"We stayed during January with my wife to celebrate her BDay. And honestly saying I was really surprised by this Hotel. The service was excellent! From the first minute of our arrival the attitude of the staff was extremely attentive. The room was great, the service in the restaurant was wonderful, the pool service was always at a high level. Special appreciates to Mr. Duminda (Restaurant Manager) and Mr. Panditha (Waiter) who made the birthday celebration especially memorable!",positive
"I was a guest at your hotel for two days from 5th Feb to 6th Feb 2022 occupying room #305. When checking out I accidentally left behind my phone charger. When I contacted the hotel Ms Leka Thilini, the Receptionist answered the phone and she very kindly helped me to get back my lost item. She took this matter in a very personal way and got Mr Dhananjaya Caldera, the Assistant Front Office Manager to hand it over to me. I would like to place on record my sincere gratitude to these two lovely members of your staff further stating that they are big assets to your distinguished organization A big thank you to them - Mrs Rohini Dissanayake",positive
"This hotel is classed as 5* it certainly is not. The refurbished rooms are definitely not. The hotel is tired and scruffy, the rooms are dirty (we were offered 2 rooms) and the pool is filthy. The staff were not bothered that we were unhappy and we were very polite in our complaint. We checked in at 5pm and checked out at 7pm",negative
"Overall we were disappointed with this hotel compared to others we stayed in during our trip to Sri Lanka. The room was tired and badly needing updated, things like seeing the same room service plates still outside the same room door hours later was unhygienic and attracted bugs. The food, we were half board so ate at the buffet breakfast and dinner. I really struggled as at dinner there was only a variety of curries available and being pregnant and adverse to certain smells I couldn’t even go up to see what was available. However the staff were fantastic at dealing with this for me and I honestly couldn’t have been in better hands. I really did appreciate their efforts in ensuring I ate a proper meal once they realised I was struggling. The pools were easily the best pools we had access to during our trip, we spent a lot more time using these facilities than we did anywhere else. One of the things I disliked was being shouted at from behind the chain link fence to come and see what the locals were selling but they’re not on hotel property so I understand there isn’t anything staff can do about them. We were on our honeymoon and our tour operator had told us in our itinerary to bring our marriage certificate in order to receive honeymoon benefits. However when we checked in staff said it wasn’t needed and didn’t acknowledge it was our honeymoon at all.",neutral
"We liked hotel and stuff, we think that hotel needs renovations but overall it was nice, stuff Namal was very nice made his job for 10 out of 10! Such a good time we spent there and I would recommend hotel",positive
"We stayed at Heritance Ahungalla for the second time and again enjoyed the splendid architecture, the beautiful location, the excellent food and - about of all - the friendliness of the staff. Our particular thanks go to Rukmal for the room service and to Dinesh, the pool attendant and to the restaurant manager Duminda and his very friendly and helpful staff. A small recommendation to other guests: try to avoid taking a room near to the pool bar which can get quite noisy in the evening. As a wheelchair user I particularly appreciate that all areas are barrier free.",positive
"Years ago this was probably a very grand hotel, however the grandeur has faded. The location & facilities appear very good, however the devil is in the detail and the lack of cleanliness makes the whole place feel grubby. I have stayed at numerous 5 star hotels around the world and have seen how standards vary in each continent. So using a European standard I would only rate this 3 star, which might meet some guests expectations. The staff are very friendly and energetic as we have experienced in all seven hotels during our two week Secrete Escapes tour. What this hotel lacks is Management direction to fix the cleanliness issues. As an example I enclose pictures of our recently renovated room where staff regularly create “towel animals” when they should be directed to scrub mould of the newly tiled bathroom walls & floors.",neutral
A few teething problems which we raised with management and they were quick to resolve. Chaminda in housekeeping ensured the room was spotless. The pool attendant on green pool was very helpful. We ate in a la carte restaurant and food was of an excellent standard as was the service. The manager addressed our issues speedily and appropriately. He checked up on us. We had an excellent end to a great trip.,positive
"What an experience it’s been at this hotel. I can’t rate it highly enough. We stayed here for six days in January and it was absolutely perfect from start to finish and that’s all down to the staff. If we return to Sri Lanka and this hotel - it won’t be for the bricks and mortar (although it’s great) it will be for the very special people who work here. A special shout out to our room guy Rukmal! I’ve stayed in plenty of hotels around the world but I can’t remember any as being so attentive to detail as Rukmal is. Everyday he makes me smile with the way he has dressed the room with flowers, nice cushions and the towel art is another level… He’s such a warm, happy, hard working guy. Also want to give special mention to two guys have made our trip incredible. Lilanga and Nipun - they have catered for our every wish and whim. We set them a challenge of getting us some vintage champagne so we could celebrate something special and the scoured the whole of the island, rang every hotel and managed to find two bottles of vintage Dom Perignon for us before we left. They really have pulled out all the stops to make our stay so memorable. They made sure all our dining has been spectacular by setting up a gorgeous table on the beach, three nights consecutively. I can’t heap enough praise on them enough. I’m so glad we got to know these guys, and that should be a little tip for other travellers. The hospitality industry has taken a battered since Covid and the staff work so hard by trying to make every guest feel exceptional. I always like to show my appreciation by learning everyone’s name, giving them my time, conversation and a few words of encouragement - it really does go along way and it will make your time here go from great to excellent. You can move mountains with guys like Rukmal, Lilanga and Nipun on your team. They are an absolute credit to the hotel and the Heritance brand should know what assets they have working for them. The hotel is beach fronted large and comfortable. Both pools is absolutely huge and so warm and welcoming. The food has been wonderful and the evenings we have spent on the beach, dining by the waves have been exceptional. But everything is down to the staff here. Worth 10 stars just for them!",positive
Rukmal from house keeping well deserves a five star rating. Presentation is excellent and cleaniless of the place is 5/5 Very happy with his services here at hertinace ahungalla. Well done Rukmal and the team...,positive
"Had a family vacation to Heritance Ahungalla this January. This was our first time in Sri Lanka, so first time experience. There are few beaches down the coast, each with its own features. Ahungalla beach was beautiful: wide and clean. Although hotel doesn’t have its private beach area (I guess none of the hotels do), it is so not crowded with other people so it feels like private. Hotel may seem not as new but it’s a good quality one. It is also very quite and green, which makes it perfect to have the right getaway. Pool is clean with pool bar service available. And the view of the ocean and sunsets is just breathtaking! We had it all-inclusive. Every evening hotel makes different cuisine of the world (Indian, Japanese, Thai etc). We stayed for more almost 2 weeks and were absolutely fine with the food👍🏼 Apart from everything it is people who make your stay memorable and comfortable. I noticed that Sri Lankan people in general are naturally very open and kind, and ready to help. But to say specifically about Heritance we even made good friends with staff! Not all names I could spell right, but thank you Tharindi from the reception and Tony from the restaurant to make us feel like home and being so nice to our family, we are so thankful💕 All the best to the hotel and team!",positive
"Heritance Ahungalla is wonderful. We had a fantastic holiday. Staff is super friendly and go out of their way to be helpful. We were traveling with two kids and they went out of their way to be nice to the kids. Housekeeping and restaurant in particular were superb. Rukmal, Sunath and Pawan even went to the extent of creating adorable animals to keep them entertained. Loved it and definitely coming back! ❤️",positive
"for my office day out we choose this hotel,on last December 2021. the hotel is a master piece oF arch Jeffry Bawa, the lobby,landscape walks ways very beautiful. i enjoyed the swimming pool very much and at the deep end you can do even diving too. the lunch buffet was nothing grand, but it was edible, the staff each and everways was helpful..friendly.. hope to visit for a long week end soon",positive
"An absolutely amazing place to relax and unwind. It’s a very open, spacious and quiet environment. Rooms were incredibly comfortable and spacious. The staff were very attentive and quick to attend to any special requests. The buffet was good with plenty of variety. Couldn’t ask for anything more!",positive
What an amazing place to visit and relax with the family... Had a great time.. More than the interior whats special abou this hotel is the surroundings and the architecture (Bawa is a GENIUS) built along with the nature.. The staff were super friendly and excellent service all n all...,positive
Amazing place with the most kind and welcoming staff the location is good facilities r really nice with wonderful view of the ocean the breakfast was great the dinner was fair over all was really nice to stay there🌹🌹,positive
"We stayed for 3 nights in Heritance Ahungalla hotel. First night we had few compliance on our room, but early in the morning they fixed everything. They tried so hard to fix everything and to impress us, which they succeeded. Room boy named Rukmal is so kind and great guy, he made our room look like dream. Also I have to mention supervisor Chaminda, he came and present to us that they are on our service and they they will help us for any request we have. Hotel is on great position, beach is amazing, food great and service is very quick. I recomend you this hotel!!!",positive
"I would definitely stay here again. There were few hick ups, but the staff friendly and were quick to address the issue raised. LOVED LOVED the infinity pool overlooking the ocean. Great way to spend the afternoon relaxing, swimming, reading, and enjoying life.",positive
"Our room at the hotel was very impressive but sadly quite noisy. You could hear everything from the corridors and in the room above. The hotel itself was a bit tired. The green swimming pool was amazing and usually quite quiet but the main pool was very busy all the time and with lots of children playing games so it was not very peaceful. The setting is lovely and the beach is really very beautiful, we enjoyed spending time on it. The staff were well meaning and friendly however we did have a few issues. I think perhaps not all of what we said/asked was understood but instead of asking to clarify they said yes and just said of course, no problem. This meant that we had a couple of situations which left us with problems. We booked a PCR test and expressly asked if the cost could be charged to our room. We were told that this was fine and no problem, then when we came to do the test we were told we needed to pay in cash which we did not have. The hotel did. It do anything to help and we found ourselves roaming the streets in the midday heat desperately trying to find a cash machine and very stressed. We also arranged a late check out which we had to pay for. We agreed this and then confirmed it the next day. Despite this on the day of check out we got a call saying we needed to vacate the room. We queried this and confirmed what we had arranged previously and were told they didn’t have anything on their system and we would need to clear our room straight away but they could put us in another room. We were not packed or prepared for this and the whole thing turned out last day into a really stressful and ruined day.",negative
What a joy the staff here are; just so pleasant and eager to please. Happy New Year Rukmal !!! We were given this charming elephant on our bed surrounded by flowers. Highly recommend Ahungalla Hertance,positive
Everyday the cleaning service came and make wunderfull work its alsways clean Rukmal is the guy that make this wunderfull things I like the hotel a lot. The best in the hotel is room service the food is very good,positive
"The room and the hotel was clean. The food spread wasn't that good. My parents are vegetarian and they hardly had anything to eat. However they were very accomodating of my child and his needs. He refused to eat at the restaurant twice and both times the restaurant manager (Mr Illanga) was very helpful with arranging his Mel's. He made sure, at every meal to ask us if my child would need anything special done from the kitchens. It is that kind of hospitality that we imagine getting from a Sri Lankan hotel.",neutral
"We stayed 4 nights which was great. The whole family had a good time. The rooms were very clean on arrival and well maintained by house keeping daily. The whole hotel was well kept and clean. Food was great. We tried the buffet, a-la-carte and room service. All of which was well made and a very good value for money. The pools are well maintained with life guards monitoring both. Our rooms opened out to the second pool at the hotel which offered ample shade during the day. The beach is also great; we had some good fun riding the waves and building sand castles with the kids! My wife and I had SPA treatments which were great and helped with the relaxation and sun burn! Having local crafts people selling their art work onsite was a nice addition and allowed us to get some souvenirs from the trip. The live music in the evenings was great too! Only disappointment for me was the pina colada score: 1/10",positive
Excellent property well maintained too. Great hospitality with lovely food & great people. 25th December night there was over 250pax for dinner & the hotel was almost full but the F&B staff including all executive put there shoulders to the wheel specially JAYALATH @ the main restaurant is a hard working member with very good skills with ample experience know how to satisfy a customer. I witnessed the pool attendant/ life guard PRADEEP JAYALATH His presence of mind save the life of young child on 26th around 3-4p.m. He too deserves a huge respect too.,positive
The quality of the room was great and the room boy Namal did a great job for us. The housekeeping staff work really hard unlike the pool bar staff who spend more time talking to each other than worrying about the customers who have to wait until they are ready to serve you. The exception to this is Asela who was excellent unlike his colleagues he was vigilant and attentive to customers. Reception staff were very helpful best among them were Trili and Daninja who looked after us very well. Finally the restaurant was okay and Nuwan was the best of the restaurant staff. Nice beach hotel.,positive
What a brilliant place.... The customer service is simply remarkable. It's truly one of the best hotels in Sri Lanka.... Im sure people have been to Heritance Kandalama and overjoyed... this is also something you will never forget... Food is lovely... People are awesome.... ❤️,positive
We had nice time with them... Super good service from Them.... Will come again and join with you guys.... Good food tho.. Nice time with pool.. Atmosphere is excellent.... The room which we stayed is super tidy and clean... and also spa very good ...,positive

"Apologies ! This should have been written a while ago. By no means does the below completely under rate our experience, but hopefully the feedback will be taken as useful, with both the good and bad. The Bad: Having to change rooms the last 2 days, due to water heating and aircon issues. Lack of food options when less guests (totally understandable but still a shame, especially at breakfeast). Wear and tear is visible, a renovation would be a great bonus. But it by no means spoilt our trip, just an observation. Alot of mould in the bathrooms, requires some attention. I know it's a beach resort but the build up can get a little much. Due to choosing ""all inclusive"" option, the cocktails are very limited. Are nice but limited. I think if I went next time I would not do all inclusive, purely so we could enjoy a bit more diverse range. Snack foods however, (I recomend the fish and chips!) are lovely ! Due to post covid, lack of features and actitives are limited (again understandable, but needs mentioning prior to booking). Examples, Bicycle rentals, Spas, nightclub etc. Also the build up on rubbish on the shores, but again was due to time of the year with the seas as well. The Weird: The constant hello from a lady passing the perimeter of the hotel nearly every day trying to sell something. A Foreign guest who seems to be treated like royalty & known by all staff (Hi Aiya?!), I know there are less guests, but 3 beds, 6 cushions and 6 towels (with change every few hrs) for 2 people is a bit much... Also witnessed the attempt of trying to give chocolates to everyone including children (other guests) seemed a bit weird, maybe their form of a Santa? The repetiveness of the music in the restaurant and the bar, please I would advise working on changing this ! Or atleast having a different playlist alternating every other day ! If I heard John Lenon's Yesterday instrumental one more time... !! And the rest of Good ! (a lot more) : Firstly, the highest points go to the the staff and service, truely everyone that worked there were such amazing human beings, and we were humbled to have stayed at the resort with them ! Their commitment and attentivness was visible throughout our stay, so thank you very much to all of you. Cleaners : Nearly every day not only were the rooms tidied, but we were left with decorative and hilarious towel arrangements ! Kudos to the creativity ! Shout out to Dukmal and his colleagues for this ! I wish you all the best sir. Front of house & general assitance : Welcomed from the first minute by all and every request and detail asked was attented to. Samith whom we were greeted every day by and was checked in on was a great help & very friendly, even arranged a tour to the Safari for us and breakfasts to take was ensured. Sorry we missed saying good bye to you ! Hope to see you again. Restaurant: Lilanga, a gentlemen in charge of the restaurant, with a wealth of knowledge and tries to cater to all your needs . If you ever feel a meal is not right or if you need something, do reach out to him and he will help you, Thanks again ! A big gratitude to Jananjaya, whom we felt looked after us so much every day. Whom we grew to bond with, it was a pleasure meeting you ! Other names to mention, and sorry for not remembering all ! Tony, Panditha, Chamila as well, and also the lovely ladies who always greeted us and sat us down to our tables for every service. Bar: Much thanks to Calinga ! Thank you for all the cocktails. And again others who served us at the bar ! Pool: Both guys we had were amazing and made sure we always had towels, and cushion for the sunbeds. Dinesh, very nice to meet you and always laughing and joking made us so much more at ease. And last but not least, although I dont have names to mention. Many thanks to the security guards who would tend to go unnoticed, but honestly they made us feel safe and secure always seeing them around. The location, on the beach front, shame about the rough seas, cannot wait to see what it is like when the seas are calm ! With the infinity pool in the main area, it felt like you were in the sea anyway ! The food selection, although sometimes smaller, sometimes bigger. Always had a good variety for most days, and was always very tasty, and fresh. As one can expect, spices are prevalent but again requests can be made to amend this. There is alot of western options to accomodate. Again a shout out to Tony whom after talking about the fact that we never saw any Kottu on the buffet, was then on the main Buffet stand the next day being enjoyed not only by our selves but all other guests ! Buffer / BBQs on the outside garden is alway also a great addition when they can accomodate this ! The peacefulness. I think due to the post covid situation, we had the best of both worlds in a sense. Weekdays we pretty much had the pools to ourselves, and the weekends more locals arrived and so the resort was busier. As much as the peacefulness was appreciated, hopefully in the future, more ""animations /activies"" & I would look to see all bars in full operation, can be achieved to change the days up a bit. The wildlife, Birds, Iguanas, lizards, monkeys. Nothing disturbing but made it so much more tranquil with the plantation as well being among all of this. Not to mention the few dogs and cats. If you like plantation indoors as well, then you will enjoy the rooms and hotel itself as well, at night time they look even better if the lights are working. We stayed at Heritance 15th to the 27th. And really hope to visit another time in the near future !",neutral
"We came for the hotel for lunch buffet and then stayed there for the rest of the day. The hotel staff were professional, kind , welcoming and warm. We had a group of 5 kids and 8 adults. Used the pool for the majority of the time and then right next to the hotel you can have beach access to this white sandy beach. The experience was amazing. We have stayed in many different hotels and so far this was the hotel with best service. You can enjoy their pool and all the other services without getting a room but just by buying the buffet. We highly recommend staying in here.",positive
"Heritance Ahungalla was a mixed bag for me, despite the grand entrance, the hotel looked slightly dilapidated and we were disappointed to see that the boat in the swimming pool was absent. Given the age of the hotel, I expected the service to be more refined, and, except for an exceptional experience with a man called rukmal who was exceedingly hospitable, the staff seemed worn out and thus slightly disgruntled. In the buffet I had to ask the staff 3 times to obtain a cup of coffee. I got the impression that the staff were overworked, but wanted to help.The buffet was delicious though small( the dishes though were of a very high quality). The rooms were lovely, however, the triple room we booked was just a double room with an small, and uncomfortable foldable bed added on. As I came primarily for the wonderful location, and food, I was not particularly disappointed.",neutral
"Enjoyed the beach and the food. Pools are spacious and not crowded. Evening entertainment was great. We immensely enjoyed the Fire limbo show.. Hotel is one of the oldest, need a better outlook than this, however this is homely. can recommend to anybody who wants a peaceful holiday. Try to stay during weekdays..",positive
"We visited Heritance Ahungalla on 15th December 2021 to celebrate our son's B'day.. .It was a best day to our family. Hospitality of the whole staff was excellent.. We specially thank Mr. Duminda, Mr Jayantha and Miss Lihini with restaurant staff, and front office staff. Because we had a surprising B'day arrangement on that night. We love to visit again. Asanga Liyanaarachchi and family",positive
It’s always wonderful to come back! I feel safe with all the safety measures taken by the hotel! The experience is always a delight! The service as always exceeds expectation! Keep up the good work and a big thank you to all the hotel staff for making our stay safe and wonderful!,positive
Rukmal brings a little bit of joy to our hotel room each morning! Staying at the Heritance Ahungalla hotel in Sri Lanka. We can’t wait to see what creation Rukmal will leave us every day and what props he will use.,positive
"I had a wonderful vacation in the Heritance Ahungalla. Great Service overall, great food and important very comfortable beds!! Special thanks to Trilishiya! A very charming, helpful lady at the reception. Special thanks also to Namal from housekeeping!",positive
"This place stinks of quality: the walk to our room was sophisticated with open squares full of tropical trees and a very classy colour scheme throughout. Service was extremely attentive, and the food was impressive. The pool by our room was beautiful. The hotel itself is quite old, with some fittings showing their age, but everything worked and now's not the time to be spending huge amounts on renervations so no criticism there! Excellent overall.",negative
"Spent a wonderful 5 days here after a tour. Its still very quiet here- they are desperate for more visitors, but that has meant we have had never-ending attention. The staff are so friendly and keen to please. Rukmal our room boy has made amusing towel creations, the pool boy has given us double cushions and pillows on our sunbeds, the gardening boy has presented me with a beautiful posy etc. The pools are beautiful. The sea is warm but always big waves so forget snorkelling. When you step on the beach a gang of saleswomen try to persuade you to buy their wares! The food is excellent, and the range gets bigger when there are more guests. The trip to Madhu lake nearby is worth doing. Do come and stay here, the staff deserve more guests!",positive
It's a great holiday but the location not so good. The hotel is right on the beach but no swimming the sea was to rough. The staff were great good not do enough for for your but outside of the hotel were very few shops so you have get a taxi every where but they are cheap enough.,neutral
Extremely friendly and great service by Ranil from house keeping. My parents and grand parents have been visiting for the past thirty years and will continue visiting again. The hospitality at the hotel is very good,positive
"Heritance Ahungalla is a 40-year-old seaside holiday resort with a splendid beachfront location. The hotel has been built over a sprawling area and has all the modern amenities/facilities one would expect. The property has two large swimming pools, tennis courts, a well-equipped gym, a billiards table, a spa as well as shopping facilities. We stayed here for 8 days in September during our 15-day quarantine transit through Sri Lanka, heading onward to the US. It is a serene property ideally suited for middle-aged and older patrons looking for some calm away from the bustle of the city. The food was great. They had different cuisines catering to guests from various parts of the world. The Catering Managers were extremely friendly and accommodating. The front desk staff was also very supportive and sporting. Mr. Lilanga deserves a special mention for his attention to detail and the personal care that he extended to us. The rooms were clean and spacious with a view of the pool and the ocean beyond it. Overall our weeklong stay was very comfortable and thoroughly enjoyable.",positive
"We stayed at this hotel for the first time back in the late 90s, when it was called Triton. By the way, the statue of this Triton still flaunts at the entrance. It was a marvelous, respectable hotel with several restaurants, a tea room, fine service, and two lovely swimming pools. This is a beautiful colonial-style building, inside there are very beautiful galleries, between which water flows, trees and flowers grow. This is real architecture, not a soulless block with rooms. Unfortunately, the hotel ended up under water in December, 2004. The staff will tell you that only the first floor was flooded, and they will lie. Typical tsunami traces will also be on the third floor, this can be seen, although the walls are being tinted. I don't really understand how they got 5 stars. It is a very sad sight of destruction and extinction. The hotel is a pity as an old horse, from which they are trying to squeeze out the remnants of strength. Unmown grass, peeling sun loungers, frayed beach towels, yellowed bath towels, stained old linen, squeaky air conditioner, mildew, dampness, musty. Tiles are falling off in pools. Fence-mesh around the perimeter. And that is not all. This once beautiful hotel is now used as a staging post for bus groups, arriving to spend one night before departure. From the pros: It is still an outwardly beautiful building The staff works with full dedication Decent cuisine for Europeans, not too spicy, many adapted dishes. In the room, like more than 20 years ago, a bowl of fresh seasonal fruits will be waiting for you. The staff is still on the ball.",negative
"The food in this hotel is very tasty, no other hotel has ever tasted so good. special thanks to the maid Namal, he was very good at cleaning the room and leave a lot of flowers. Beautiful place and hotel",positive
"Had a great holiday @ one of the best property in southern coast. Very ferindly staff, excellent buffet with so many varieties of food & brilliant service. Rooms are spacious and comfort.

"Visited to one of the best best beach property in sri lanka. Very friendly staff, excellent buffet & service with so many varities and luxurious room. So many entertainment and activities to do in the hotel. Recommend to anybody to have a great stay.",positive
"Glorious place. Choose the room 105, if you have kids and want easy access to the pool. If you go on weekends they have activities for kids as well. Staff were overwhelmed I think with the number of visitors to the place however they did try their best. The welcome reception should have been a little bit more and not like as if you are checking in to motel.. Food was average, if not below average.",positive
Excellent and safe experience all the way from Check in to Check out...very good adherence to Covid safety guidelines put us at ease considering our age.. Excellent selection of food and Very efficient friendly staff...rooms were clean and well catered for..special mention of our room boy Lasantha who was outstanding.. a hotel with very good facilities for either a fun filled outing or a relaxed get away..,positive
"my self, my husband, and my child visited to Ahungalla hesitance during our trip to Galle. We booked one room there suddenly without a prior notice. In front desk, there was a staff member, Lihini, who helped our booking process. She was very helpful and charming. she helped with checking process and also the entire stay. The environment was very good for my child and she adapted easily to the environment thanks to Lihini. The rooms were cleaned and very comfortable. Most importantly the staff was amazing from checking to departure. Special gratitude goes to front desk staff member Lihini. hope to visit again",positive

"We were stayed here two nights on a FB basis. This was our first hotel stay in this year due to covid 19. We got a nice cleaned room, food was so tasty, facilities are nice. There was a one thing which I never seen at any hotel. The restaurant manager personally come and ask from a guests about the tasty of foods, how we satisfied about their service, our feedback, and if anything needed they are ready to provide us. Apart from that here are few things I noticed. 1. There was a lady named Lekha at the reception. She was nice and tried her best to give a superb service. 2.There was a guy named Rukmal at the house keeping, who always doing his duties with a smile. He was attended to our requests within minutes each time, and gave us a superb service. He is a real gentleman. 3.The restaurant staff always did their duties professionally and friendly. I have seen they all are quickly attending to the guest and try to fullfill their requests. Hats off to them for their great service. Based on my experience I highly recommended this hotel to both locals and foreigners and will definitely visit here once again in the future.",positive

"I stayed at Heritance Ahungalla from 20th to 24th October 2021 and had an excellent stay. Such a great get away from the pandemic fears and stressful life were just what my young family and I needed. Beautiful beach and great ambiance at the hotel made our stay pleasant and full of fun, especially for the kids. The service was excellent and staff was ever more polite and friendly, attending to all the needs of my young family. I need to specially mention about the food, which was healthy and full of variety. Delicious dishes ranged from all kinds of cuisine mesmerized our taste buds with that aromatic deliciousness. Desserts were so awesome and very healthy. I even wrote a poem after having so much desserts (I am not a dessert person) because it was truly delightful and full of variety! Thank you so much for the wonderful Chefs, and their teams as well as for the hotel staff. We are sure to return very soon! Found love in desserts! Marshmallows in rainbow colours Ginger and coconut pudding Sweet spices and crunch in white So many cakes mouthwatering guests Vanilla cheese cake, raspberry/passionfruit pools, chocolate mousse, white chocolate and coffee crème brule Float you up to the clouds Aroma of fresh pineapples, star fruit, papaya, passionfruit and watermelon Sugary and sour with fragrance of exotic power Say all about our home.

"The stay was amazing. Unfortunately, the covid situation is still having an impact on the number of guests, which inturns leads to hotels being unable to have a buffet. Heritance compensated well by letting us order anything we had in mind. Mr. DUMINDA went out of his to make this possible. Thank you to him and also Mr RASIKA and the the of the staff staff for a memorable stay.",positive

"My husband and I spent a spectacular 8 days at Heritance Ahungalla. The property is just stunning, set right on the ocean, with extensive, lovingly tended grounds studded with generous, spreading trees and two inviting pools. The building is beautiful and flows into the natural setting. The rooms have serene ocean and garden views and are very well designed and maintained However, the most outstanding feature was the warm and attentive service. Restaurant manager Mr.Duminda and his team provided delicious meals. We especially loved all the different fresh made pickles and Sambols along with the hoppers. The staff were so hospitable and ever willing to go the extra mile to meet different needs. The Housekeeping staff was awesome, responding almost instantly to all our requests and ever helpful! Thank you all for giving us such an unforgettable experience!!",positive
We have been staying here for 14 days quarantine from 23rd September to 9th October 2021. Cleanliness and sanitization of all facilities is very exceptional especially Housekeeping staff Name “Rukmal” he is very professional and cleaning our room everyday like you are arriving on the first day. I wish I could upload the post pictures of our room. The resort staff is very nice and professional. The restaurant is very well organized for guests of a Level 01 quarantine facility with buffet meal. I have one special note for fruit section everyday same fruit repeating. They need to put different varieties of fruit on alternative days. Internet connectivity is excellent where we have been staying.,positive

"The view is splendid, the staff takes of you like you are one of their own. Great variety of choices in terms of food and even if the splendid buffet does not coincide with what you want, they would prepare any type of food for you if you ask for. The two pools are great and there is even a jacuzzi. The rooms are just stunning, and the view completely worth the night price. It’s also very safe in terms of Covid, protocols are respected and distance kept. 100% recommended",positive

The restaurant staff were just superb, with special mentions going out to Rebecca, Tony, Lilanga the F and B executive, nothing was too much trouble and the food was excellent, All Covid Guidelines were adhered to and the reception staff very good too with special mentions to a Lekha and Saponika. I was only going to stay a couple of nights but extended my stay to 10 nights: best decision ever! With the lovely Bawa architecture, I did not feel restricted, although following your first PCR upon arrival, expect to remain in the room until the result. The hotel has to be commended for its good management. I also appreciated the fact that despite the limited number of guests, the bar lounge did provide entertainment, with a singer and traditional dancing.",positive

Or the extraordinary team that takes care of the rooms.... from morning to night Dumunda and Rukmal and all the others were there, helpful and caring. Also the staff in the restaurant, the pool bar, the watchmen, or at the reception all are wonderful :)) And definitely the young man who does the tests.... it could not have been carried out more sensitively! To say a word about the accommodation, the facility is beautiful and clean. The rooms are cozy and everything is there to have a good time.

"I stayed at Heritance Ahungalle in March 2021 as part of a government mandated quarantine stay. It is categorized a Level 1 Tourist Bubble Hotel. The hotel had all the quarantine protocols well setup on arrival and my check in process was very smooth. The first PCR test was conducted within half an hour of my arrival. Although it is an older property, it is well maintained and clean. The food choices provided were good and plentiful. The staff went over and above to make me and the other guests feel welcome, safe and comfortable. They were very friendly and quick to respond to any requests. I would like to particularly mention Nipun (F&B Manager), Supunika (Guest Relations Executive) and Namal (Housekeeping) for their exceptional service. The restaurant staff and everyone at the hotel worked very hard during this difficult time to bring a sense of normalcy to all the guests. Thank you from Canada.",positive
We enjoyed staying at Heritance Ahungalla for our 14 day quarantine. This hotel worked with us to provide the necessary paperwork we needed for immigration and airport officials so that we could come to Sri Lanka from the USA. We could not have pick a better place. We had access to a bit of the beach. We enjoyed the beautiful birds and fantastic wildlife that frequent the Hotel property. We especially enjoyed seeing the troop of purple faced monkeys. The food was totally incredible. Our rooms were kept spotless by very kind and thoughtful the room attendants. The attendants and managers at the desk were helpful and professional. They were able to get our quarantine release paperwork done for us in time for check out! Thank you all very much.,positive
"Excellent stay with friendly staff - Rukmal, Duminda and Chaminda specially. Very spacious and clean rooms. Lots of entertainment were provided and hotel went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable. Amazing value!",positive
"More recently, we had a rest with a group of friends at the Heritance Ahungalla hotel on the island of Sri Lanka. The impressions were the most pleasant. The hotel is very comfortable, clean, tidy and beautiful. The window offers a stunning view of the ocean, there are many vegetation and animals around. In the morning you wake up to a variety of singing amazing, exotic birds. And when you leave your room for breakfast, you can see a family of monkeys, which is located on the branches of the nearest trees. A very funny sight. There were no problems with food, as there are dishes of both local and more familiar cuisine for us. Another pleasant feature of the hotel is that the beach is located some 100 meters from the hotel. Since during our trip there was quarantine in the country, nevertheless, we did not feel any inconvenience, because the ocean was within walking distance. I would also like to mention the staff of the pool bar and in particular Mr. Darshana. Very nice person, brilliant employee and very friendly guy. Always ready to serve and help. In general, I liked the rest very much. I hope I will come here at least one more time.",positive
"We had an overall good experience when we were quarantined for 13 nights at Heritance, Ahungalla. The hotel: It was a pleasant hotel. There were many activities, functions for the guests, but we didn't participate because of personal choice. The room: We stayed in a luxury suite, and it was very roomy. I had a large balcony so I could relax while distancing myself from others. I felt like we were staying at a single-bedroom apartment. The staff: Every single person we met went above and beyond. Especially, Duminda and the team and housekeeping. There was not much Sri Lankan food for us, so the F&B team made special orders for the ex-Sri Lankans. That was the highlight of the stay. There was no office room available, so they let me do my work from the cafeteria. Also, Jaminja (Cpt) made me some excellent ginger tea and coffee. Food: Main meals we sub-par for a five-star hotel, but the dessert menu was the best dessert menu I've ever seen. The person who was on the wok station made sure we get tasty meals as well-my personal favorite food station! Tours: We took a 1-day tour to Anuradhapura. Our tour guide did his best to make sure we enjoy our trip, but overall the tour did not meet our expectations; we paid $350 (Rs. 69,500). For breakfast, we received one water bottle, a sandwich made with ham and butter, an orange, a banana, a piece of cake, and a sugary snack. And we received the same for lunch. The vehicle was not roomy; made for long tours- we are average-sized people, and there was not much legroom. We had another tour planned for the day after next to Pollonnaruwa, but I decided to cancel it. We don't mind paying money for the tours but expect a way better service. Overall, it was good. I hope this review would help make things better for future customers and give credit where it's due.",positive
"Our stay at Heritance Ahungalla was very nice. We enjoyed the pool, the ocean and the music in the evenig. The Corona-Protection was also very good and we felt very safety during our stay at the hotel. The stuff members were very helpful and we enjoyed the volleyball games with them in the evenig. Also the service at the bar and in the restaurant were very attentive. Further the room service, especially our cleaning guy Rukmal was very good and he created for us a lot of ""towel animals"". Finally we can say that we had a wonderful time in Sri Lanka and in this beautiful hotel.",positive
"Our quarantine stay at Heritance Ahungalla has been exceptional, so much so that we forget we are quarantining for 2 weeks before we are able to head home to see our families. The room, the amenties and food have been excellent - something new and exciting on offer every single day makes the long stay at the hotel go by so fast. Upon arrival, we were upgraded to a luxury suite (room 101) with a terrace bigger than most flats in London! Rukmal makes up our room everyday and we always look forward to see what creative towel-animal he's got in store for us every single day! Dumindha and the restaurant staff have been so nice, if we ever miss breakfast for a lie in, they send a plate to our room without even being asked so we don't miss out on anything. They are always asking us what cravings we have so they can ask the chef to make it for us. The reception staff are very polite and helpful and do everything in their power to make sure our stay is comfortable and also plan and ensure we get all our mandatory PCR testing done timely. Thank you very much to Hertiance Ahungalla for your hospitality!",positive
"We had to do quarantine during our travel to Sri Lanka, Sri Lankan airlines provided us with a list of hotels (over 90) that we could choose to privately book our stay at. From searching the locations of the hotels other reviews and images i had finally chosen to pick Heritance Ahungalla and if i had to chose again i would hands down pick the same. i have been to many hotels prior to only have a handful of staff that take pride in their jobs, here every employee i encountered was extremely pleasant to deal with. everyone was willing to help in anyway possible to make our stay as enjoyable as possible for us.",positive
"The Sri Lankan tourism board currently requires a mandatory quarantine of 2 weeks which can be completed at multiple level 1 safe and secure hotels. My mum and I decided to stay at heritance ahungalla for the full 14 days because the service was that amazing! Since our arrival, the manager Duminda went the extra mile to make our stay a great one. I’ve also watched the way he interacts with all guests to make everyone feel like a member of the family. Every employee in hospitality should be trained by him- truly a star ! Every day there are multiple activities to take part in from water aerobics to volleyball. Amila the animator has so much energy and makes all the classes enjoyable. I’d never played volleyball before and the animator took the time to teach me the technique and encouraged me to keep trying and carry on! The hotel has two large pools and a beach where you can catch the sunset around 6pm. There’s a gym with life fitness machines and high quality weights. If that wasn’t all enough the tennis, badminton, table tennis and croquet will keep you busy. The buffet is delicious my favourites have been the devilled cuttlefish, crabs, and prawns. Wow the chefs are great and always happy to chat about how they make their delicious dishes. Jananjaya, the host is friendly and so quick! He also serves the best yard tea that I’ve ever tasted. In the evening there is always entertainment, for example, kandyan dancers, DJ’s, fire acrobats and more! Darashana at the bar is great and the drinks are fantastic. In general the whole team at anhungalla heritance have been consistently 10/10. Everybody I have interacted with served with charm, energy and good humour. I can’t wait to come back again. Quarantine here has been paradise !",positive
"My husband and I are visiting Sri Lanka from the United States, and according to the Sri Lankan quarantine regulations, we had to choose a “Level 1” hotel to complete our quarantine period of 14 days. We chose Heritance, Ahungalla, an Aitken Spence Hotel, and we are currently staying there. I wanted to write this review mainly because of the awesome staff who operates this property. Starting from the General Manager to the lifeguards, the whole crew is dedicated to providing an unparalleled service level to their guests. We felt that the GM, Sisira Senaratne is an asset to this hotel, and has the best crew that he could possibly have. His team represents among the highest levels of guest service we have experienced. The team here goes the extra mile and out of their way at every level to make it a wonderful and memorable experience for their guests. The entire staff here are exceptionally friendly, patient, and helpful in every way that a hotel guest would expect them to be. The restaurant manager, Duminda Gunasinghe, is excellent, and he is personally attending to all guests individually to make sure that guests are happy and satisfied with every meal. The servers including Jananjaya and the three female servers are very hospitable. They always treat us with a smile and taking care of us like family. The chefs are cool, and they always try to create some special dish for everyone. There is only one bar in operation due to safety reasons, and the staff there are so awesome. The bar captain Dharshana, the barman Asela, and all the other staff there are amazing. I want to make a special mention about a couple of staff members: Chatura at the front desk and Kanishka at reservations. These two members went out of their way to help us to get a document that we needed from Sri Lanka Tourism while we were at the Los Angeles airport. We would not have been able to board the plane if not for these two awesome guys. Due to the time difference between Sri Lanka and the US, they had to attend to it after hours around 2:00 am in the morning. We really appreciate what they did. Finally, I want to say that we truly love the top-notch friendly and professional customer service we have received from this Hotel, and I would recommend this place in a heartbeat to any traveler.

"We stayed at Heritance Ahugalla for 14 days quarantine. I cannot thank enough the restaurant team enough for their exceptional hospitality. Special thanks to the food and beverage team. Duminda made us feel at home, his warm smile and hospitality were exceptional. The same goes to Rebecca, Sanjeewa(best jokes), Asanka, Buddhika, Nelka, Nirosh, Priyankara and the list continues. All these guys made our stay very pleasant and they went above and beyond to cater to our needs. I also want to thank the pool attendants and lifeguards Dinesh and the team. Also many thanks to the housekeeping team Ranil, Nilanga, and Thakshila. The list continues and we had a great experience.",positive
"We had splendid time at Heritance. Although was our isolation period we did not felt any inconvenience. Big shout out to all staff members - who made our stay very comfortable and joyful. We felt just like home, thanks to you 🤗 Special thanks to Dinesh Pool Attendant - Outstanding hospitality. You made our stay really special. Varuna - Pool Bar Captitan, nothing ever is too much, amazing attitude and energy Saman - House keeping, so efficient and attention to details. You helped us a lot during our stay Nilanga - Mustard Coffee Shop - very professional service. Well manners and knowledge. We loved our chats about SLankan culture and history. Wish you all the best!

"It was delightful to experience true Srilankan hospitality at Heritance Ahungalla during my recent stay. From the list of hotels to quarantine, having been here 14 years ago, the only place I wanted to stay was Heritance Ahungalla. From Sunethra who is at reservations who was my first point of contact to reception staff and very attentive Tony, Duminda, Nipun, Panditha, Jacob and all restaurant staff to ever so cheerful security guards to the observant lifeguards and the animators and the extremely neat and tidy housekeeping team – especially Namal and all other random staff I bump in to, THANK YOU, for making my 14 days quarantining a breeze. I didn’t feel that I was quarantining, as each and everyone of you lived up to the promise of, “weaving a little magic into my holiday while honouring the promise of the finest in hospitality and exceptional service”. The beautiful cultural shows, buffet dinners at the beach, DJ nights to soothing Sinhala songs were so enjoyable. You all are true ambassadors of Srilankan hospitality. For all of you, it could be another day at work, but your positive attitude to work and the willingness to always make your guests happy meant so much to me for over the last 2 weeks... I’m looking forward to visiting the hotel again when it is opened up for local guests. Wishing the team all the absolute best and continue weaving your magic!! Thank you!",positive
"Wow, from start to finish everything was fantastic! In the times we are in, all measures were taken to protect us from the virus. We arrived with a negative pcr, was retested on arrival and tested every 5 days. The staff were exception particularly the chefs that allowed us do a cookery class as a group with our friend that is a food doctor. Food was unreal! We went for b&b but if I was returning I would do full board. The room is beautiful room 105, overlooking the pool and beach. The door was broken, took a couple of days to fix but that was okay. If we needed anything, the staff were only more than happy to assist. One night we had a bbq on beach, very reasonably priced, 12€ including entertainment. And what great entertainment! The Sri Lankan fire limbo show was superb 👌 We will miss you, Yvonne x",positive
"I am staying in Heritance, Ahungalla, level 1 safe and secure hotel in beautiful, sunny, tropical paradise of Sri Lanka. The hotel is situated by the Indian Ocean with palm fringed,golden Sandy beach and endless rolling waves. The sunset is breathtaking! The scenery is an eye candy. One of the best beaches I’ve ever been in my many travels. The beach is the green turtle nesting place. If you wonder in to the beach at night, you are bound to experience nesting sea turtles. The hotel staff is wonderful and very attentive. Always with a big smile! The food and beverages are very good. The restaurant team led by Duminda doing a excellent job. The rooms are comfortable and clean. All the guest amenities are there for guests to have a very comfortable stay. I would highly recommend Heritance Ahungalla, if you are visiting Sri Lanka!!

"On arrival, when Reception was informed we'd been confirmed Room 333, we were told that our room would not be ready for another 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, we were then told that it would not be ready for another few hours as it's a luxury room & will take that long to clean. When we asked if this was because the previous occupants checked out late, we were told they didn't know, and when pressed, they admitted that was the reason. When we said that shouldn't have happened as the room was booked, & previous occupants should not be allowed to check out late, they offered us a ""transit room, free of charge"" until the room we had booked (which was more expensive than this ""transit room"" was ready. How could they possibly think we would be happy with a ""transit room"", which was cheaper & more basic than the one we had booked & put up with the inconvenience involved in changing rooms? When we said we weren't happy with this & insisted on talking to the Manager, he finally turned up some time later & said the previous occupants couldn't be vacated on time as they were elderly & disabled, but they would have four cleaners clean the room & it would be ready in 30 mins. Finally, we had access to the room we booked at 3.45pm (although, we should have had the room at 2pm), but we still had to wait another 15 minutes (i.e. until 4pm) for our luggage, which had been sent to the cheaper ""transit room""& had to be brought back. So, they broke their contract. A room we should have had at 2pm, was only given to us at 4pm (2 hours later). We later discovered that the previous occupants were not elderly at all. Therefore the Manager LIED. We complained to the head office and got nowhere. We have not stayed in this hotel again as a result of this disgusting treatment and we NEVER WILL. This happened some time ago, but I'm still so angry about it that I want to report it.",negative
"Thanks for this amazing vacation! Hotel is excelent, clean, comfortable, near with Ocean. Have 2 pools, meal is delicious, personal is friendly and polite. Cleaning servis is best, especially Rukmal )) he made various towel things )) like dolly, elefant 😄 Bar, waiters, guardian personal very polite.",positive
"Heritance Ahungalle, designed by renowned architect, Geoffrey Bawa, is one of our favourite hotels in Down South. We really really love this hotel for it's friendly and peaceful environment. This was our 2nd stay here. There are two large swimming pools but both were closed when we were there in January due to the pandemic situation. The staff was extremely courteous and attentive. Very impressed by the service. Food was excellent. We can't wait to come back...",positive
Worst hotel ever Felt like you are in a graveyard. The room is too far especially you need to walk from the lobby to the room is like 1km Not worth the price at all. Staff were polite especially the manager but they need to consider making the hotel better since we pay more and believe the reviews,negative
"Swimming pools are closed and there are limitations to gym due to covid situation, and due to lack of stafg room service took much time than expected .other than that no complains, staff was friendly and also there is a lovely beach",positive
"We visited Heritance Ahungalla on boxing day. The precautions taken for Covid 19 were exceptional. Special appreciation to Tharindi for arranging a quick check in as we were late for lunch. The room had a sea view and was quite spacious. Food was served as buffets for all three meals. The spread was good on all three meals. However, in terms of taste it could improve. The dinner was a barbecue, but sadly the food was over burnt. Overall the service was great and would recommend to anyone.",positive
The stay was so serene and peaceful. Lovely sceneries and great food. The set menus had a wide selection and was delicious. The staff was very helpful and full of hospitality. The hotel is great place to chill out.,positive
Quite good. But the pool & spa is not fuctioning during the situation is downlift the value of the place. The complience of CoviD-19 rules and regulations are perfect at the check in to check out. Overall good experience.,positive
"A beautiful, soothing and relaxing experience. Excellemt service with very friendly and helpful staff. Food was superb and though the it was A la carte, it turned out that we enjoyed it much more than a buffet due to the extensive choices and flexibility in the 5 course meal as well as due to the attentive staff headed by the bar and restaurant manager Thushara. The resort was well maintained even with the drop in guests. The variety of both outdoor and indoor games was available and a modernized gym. The indoor gaming room with its picturesque view needs a special reference. Geoffrey Bawa's architecture and design always touches the heart of us nature lovers and this was no different; especially after overnight rain in the early morning when you walk out of the room through the hotel to hear the drip drip of water from trees everywhere inside the building's many graceful courtyards was an enriching experience. The trees helped to quell the sometimes frustrating humidity of the coastal salty atmosphere and provided a perfecf balance while the multiple Bawa inspirated works of art added grace to the place. The two large swimming pools were closed due to government Covid restrictions but it was well compensated by all the other things. Finally a beautiful beach with no rocks and minimum dirt and stretching miles to either side. The sea was nice as well but couldn't go too far out due to repeated warnings by hotel staff about sudden undercurrents of the sea in the area. Overall well recommended for all.",positive
We had a great time at this beautiful resort. Food was awesome and tbe staff is excellent. We had two beautiful rooms with a lot of space. Thank you for your great hospitality and we will be back for sure.,positive
"Even under the pressure of pandemic restrictions (10th October 2020), many of the staff members....( Specially,the restaurant manager Mr Thushara Gnanarathne and his team;- personally i felt good.And to our suprise he was kind enough to arrange late-checkouts for some guests including us even.)....seemed trying very much to provide a high standared service with a flexible and friendly accent.. Two diverse buffets; one of them with free breverage pacakge and a singal ala carte comprised the full board menu with entertainment as well, even for the low number of guests that day. Sporting wasn't available due to health safety.. Finally, i would thank Heritance Ahungalla and her staff for making another last minute reservation of us,very much enjoyable as another memorable travel experience..",positive
"We checked in to the hotel with 2 room bookings on 31st December. The earlier review of ours were all about negative and positive sides. This comment is to mention the good side of the hotel staff and their superb services. Firstly I must say about staff from the time we checked in to the room and until we checked out, the staff was always very attentive to our stay. The Chef of the Hotel too was so good and I must say their food was so good and tasty. Although local rates were low, they have taken every effort to provide a nice buffets for the guests. Hats off to the Chef and his team. The YAARA TEA they provided was so good and the best we ever had. The rooms were very well-done and clean. The front office staff, the Security staff and the baggage handling staff all were very good and smiling and friendly. We will surely come back to enjoy another stay at Heritance Ahungalla and loved the hotel and their services. The only bad comment was our earlier review about the poor and disgusting attitudes of their FOM Srinath. If not for him, our holiday would have being even more wonderful. Hope the Management of the hotel will look in to it that it will never happen to any guests coming in during rainy days.",positive
We just stayed one day full board basis and it was really worth the drive and the money we spent. Booked the hotel with an offer but the comforts and facilities were just the same like before. Staff was extra ordinary going out of the way to help us. Really enjoyed. Food was delicious.,positive
"We booked 2 rooms on 31st December at Heritance Ahungalla and always wanted to have a good time We went to the hotel around 3pm. It was pouring rain. We stopped our car under the car porch at the entrance of the lobby. Suddenly the front office Manager (Srinath) came and asked me to take the car out with bit of an arrogant tone and told me go to the car park And come back when it was heavy rain. When I told him “Let me just keep the car under the porch until The rain settles” but the Front Office Manager (Srinath) was so adamant & arrogant that I should take my car out. The hotel was not busy. They only had few room bookings. No other vehicles were coming in and even if a tourist Bus arrived there were enough space for it. My self being a lady driver didn’t like to get wet coming back After parking the car where I have to walk about 50 plus meters to come to the lobby. The front office Manager (Srinath) would have spoken to us polite and easily handled the situation. It was just matter of few minutes keeping The car until rain stops, but FOM (Srinath) was pushing and pushing me with loud voice that I should take my car out. I lost my control and led to an argument. Just imagine it was our check-In/Welcome. The FOM (Srinath) ruined our entire holiday mood. Being the front office manager of a 5 star hotel of Aitken Spence Chain, he would have nicely handled it without any hazel. He would have just used his brain and allowed us to come in & attend to formalities until rain stops and later would have requested us to take the car to the car park. Instead he started a big ha-ho and a big argument with us and ruined our entire holiday Mood. We were going to cancel our booking. But other staff handled the situation and took care of our entry. I must mention, Tushara (Assistant F&B), the stewards, Housekeeping boys, chefs and all others were exceptionally good. They really look after us very well. The rooms, food and the services by the staff was really class. The only thing bad was the unprofessional behavior Of the Front Office Manager (Srinath). He should be given special attention by the top management in training him How to handle a welcome and how to adjust himself specially during adverse weather and how to handle guests without messing their welcome. We wish all the best to Heritance Ahungalla and the team for their wonderful and class service but so disappointed, disgusted & angry with the bad behavior of the front office manager (Srinath)",positive
"Spent the most wonderful New Year's Eve with my family at Heritance, Ahungalla and we were delighted with our suite, the amazing views of the beach and also the supportive, humble staff's service. During these difficult times, it was such a relief to see that the hotel's management took extra measures to ensure everyone's health and safety. Special thanks goes to the amazing chef Dilantha Rakitha who nailed three magnificent buffets for us. From starters to main courses to mouth watering desserts, everything was super delicious. Everything about the hotel proved our money's worth and we enjoyed and loved every bit of it!",positive
"Every thing was super! Specially food👌👌👌 Thank you for your grate service heritance! Our rooms were 329 and 331, 331 was better and it was a luxury room! If you want to rest and relax this is the best place! Room service was also excellent! Heritance group is No.1 on food! This is how it was👇",positive
Excellent view. Rooms are well cleaned. Specially we prefer the smell. Christmas eve dinner was excellent. Other meeals aslo good. Had a good variation of foods. We stayed four days here. But we could enjoy the different taste every day. Staff is very flexible and friendly. Great service. Thank you for making our vacation meaningful.,positive
We had a great experience. Everything was perfect even though the staff is short. The food was amazing. The room services were good too. I think everyone should stay for at least one night in this wonderful place.,positive
"Me and Hubby boy stayed in this beautiful location , for one day..We had a rough year,because of the covid 19 Pandemic .. Very busy with work and stressed ..

Amazing experience with amazing food!

We were lucky to enjoy buffet with compliance covid 19 rules. Food was delicious and staff was friendly and pleasant!,positive
"I was very impressed with this beautiful property. They followed all the Covid guidelines from the main entrance itself. Walking distance to the beach, clean & spacious room. Hotel staff were very helpful & polite, specialy Thushara Gnanaratgna - Restaurant & Bar Manager was extremely helpful always with a smile on his face. Overall service was excellent & well spent weekend. Thank you Team Heritance Ahungalla & will be back soon.",positive
"Last month, me and my wife visited Heritance Ahungalla. Needless to say, we had a wonderful experience. The food was so good. The buffets was something to look forward to and the staffs were very friendly and supportive. The place and the ambience was top notch. There were no complaints or critics to point out - we were so glad we chose this place to relax during the particular weekend. Wouldn’t say ‘No’ to visiting this place again.",positive
"The hotel stay was very pleasant and comfortable. Were very satisfied with every aspect of the hotel. All the staff from the front desk, restaurant staff, cleaners and security were respectful, attentive and extremely friendly creating a wonderful welcoming atmosphere. The hotel is very clean throughout and my room was specious with everything that I needed. Food was substantial and suited all tastes. Coffee, was amazing! Keep up with the great work!",positive
"It's not like it used to be when they used to call it Triton, The staff at some points are friendly, the food was not up to standard compared to what we use to have, you could have counted the number of dishes on the buffet and it was 70% Sri Lankan, we requested for a set of pillows at around 10.30 p.m which we did not receive when we called the phone was diverted to someone who abruptly told us that the hotel is closed after 10.30 so the housekeeping is not available and therefore they cannot do anything, once asked who is speaking did he say he is the security, and hung up abruptly, we called again and then the reception adhered to our request.",negative
My stay at Heritance Ahungalle was at a Corporate Outing from October 03rd to 4th 2020. The place is relaxing and breathtaking. Frontage to the Indian Ocean has been maintain very well for any guest to enjoy the beautiful sandy beach. Heritance Team is extremely friendly despite they are encountering some of the worst times for hospitality business. They looked after us very well without letting us feel the scaled-down operation. Cleanliness inside rooms is well as common spaces is commendable. Food was great and the variety is also acceptable for the grand discount offered to us. Hope Heritance will come out this very very difficult period unscathed to continue their superb hospitality for both locals and foreign guests.,positive
"We had nice time here. Food was awsome. Staff is very friendly, always smile, hardships among the pandemic. Specially wanna thanks Mr Thushara from food & beverage department who take care of my 8 months baby's food until my departure. And Housekeeping department you all doing fantastic job. Thank you very much for your kindness service. God bless you all. Keep it up good works.",positive
"When we hear the name Heritance of Aitken Spence, we usually consider it to be one of the most exciting stays. But unfortunately it is a shame to the so called brand Heritance and as well as for the Aitken Spence. We went there for our annual gathering of my workplace and we have reserved about 19 rooms for the last weekend. please find the following: Welcome: They have warmly welcomed us and given the rooms on time. It is appreciated since we got the rooms just within half an hour. Rooms: The room given to me and my wife was on the third floor. Right at the moment we stepped in to the room we felt that it was not cleaned properly. Basically it was not swept at all for weeks as we felt. We were not even provided with the bathrobes to the rooms. Further, only two towels were available at the room and not even the face towels were placed. Bathroom amenities were so old and an immediate renovation should be taken place. One of the Tea/Coffee mugs in the room was not washed (Pictures attached). Buffet: Only one restaurant in operation or only one restaurant is available. It was totally crowded. Dinner on 26th Sept 2020: Restaurant was fully crowded. They do not provide at least the enough seating capacity for the guests. If I'm not mistaken, there were two other groups checked-in to the hotel during that day. However they have arranged some tables outside the restaurant where they were not attended by a single restaurant staff member just to refill their water goblets. Food was totally bad and had a very bad experience with the so called Sri Lankan Chicken Kottu Roti. It was totally frozen andwas not tasty at all. I have complained but the only answer I got from the so called F&B Manager or the Guest Services Representative was 'Will inform and will check with the chef'. Is that an answer from a so called hotel chain like Heritance by Aitken Spence??? Restaurant staff were not capable of attending to the guests and could not even clean the buffet frequently. Please find the attached pictures of the Ice Cream corner. Breakfast on 27th Sept 2020: Compared to the dinner on previous night, this was slightly okay. But they failed arrange the seating for the whole set of occupents. Lunch on 27th Sept 2020: Again it was horrible and had nothing to eat at all. We went for lunch around 1.30pm and even on that time they are out of some food. They had a bowl with a name tag 'Chicken Sausages' and only a half of a sausage is left. When I asked for 4 sausages to me & my wife, the guy came and noted our table and promised to bring them to our table. But unfortunately I couldn't see him afterwards. When it comes to desserts corner, there were nithing to eat at all and please refer the pictures attached. No more refilling or serving and the time was 2.35pm. Premises: There was a very bad smell in the whole hotel from the evening to the noon of the next day. When inquired, they said it is from the sea. But please note that this is not the only hotel we visted in the sea side and we have no any kind of an experience from the rest of the hotels we visited. I have never being to a Heritance Hotel before and I hope that the rest of the Heritance hotels would not be like this. Personally, I'm so disappointed with the hotel and I didn't expect this kind of a service and an experience from you guys. Lack of staff, does not mean that you are free from providing the five star hospitality. If you don't have the sufficient staff, please do not accept so much of bookings for a day. In my opinion, you should pay more attention to the above in order to provide a better experience to the people who visit Heritance Ahungalla. Further, especially in this period, you all are surviving just because of the locals. I'm truly disappointed and also feel very sad. By the way, Good Luck!",negative
"Heritance Ahungalle was definitely worth a stay in Ahungalle. It's located right on the edge of Galle Road and is easily accessible. The check-in & check-out was fast, efficient and seamless. The staff was very polite and warm. The rooms (although a little dated) have star-class amenities (hot water, kettle, tea/coffee, TV, free WIFI etc). The beach is just near the hotel and the two large swimming pools offer a very good time to relax! My only complaint is with regards to the food. Not to say it was bad, but it could use more variety and flavour too. Other than that, it was a lovely hotel to stay at!",positive
We had a nice time here. Everything was really great. Food was amazing. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Nothing to complaint about our stay and we will be back again for a relaxing vacation... Thank you.,positive
"Great place and the food was awesome. Pool area was great. The beach will blow your mind way, spread across almost 500 meters. Finally let me commend all the staff from the G.M to the minor staff all was with huge smile even with all the hardships due to the pandemic. May God bless them all.",positive
"Our Stay at Heritance Ahungalla was very pleasant. The set menu was excellent. The staff in all sections were friendly and Helpful. The Happy Hour(drinks absolutely free for 2 hours, excellent deal) and credit of Rs. 3,000.00, the whole package was value for money. The b'day cake for my wife, nice touch(without even asking).",positive
Place is very beautiful with a beach and a huge pool yet the worst customer service ever. I ordered a baby food in advance but that was prepared in the last minute and was served really hot. There is no emergency lines to call in the nights. We asked for in room dining but staff were hesitant and was saying to join the buffet. We were waiting for our breakfast to be brought to our room for more than an hour.When we called the room service they said buffet is still not open due to less staff but the time was 7.10am. Highly disappointed.,negative
I have been to the hotels where you get all inclusive packages however this one is different because of their extraordinary hospitality and I really enjoyed it more than any other hotel I have ever been ....,positive
"Suddenly decided to have hotel stay. Took several searches and decided and heritance ahungalle as final stay. Online booking had added some discount about 15000 lkr. Rooms— stayed at basic delux. Had no tub on it. Clean. Attractive. I didn't asked for king size bed so got 2 single beds. It's my mistake. Food- all meals were buffet, may be due to weekends. Desert table is very good. Had sea foods also including prawns. But better if breakfast spread is much better specially on desert table. Pool- no baby pool. But 4 ft at non deep end. Staff- really friendly, really helpful. Keep it up and really thanks for that. It impress us as last time heritance kandalama experience. Altogether cost took 25000. Had 3000 credits to purchase food and with happy 2 hours local spirits were free.",positive
The hotel seems to go on forever as it is quite large and very spread-out. We had a corner room on the first floor so this gave us a small Seaview from our balcony. The room was well appointed but needed a facelift as it appeared a tad shabby in places. It may have been due to a Tsunami going through it. The food was excellent to say the least as we dined for breakfast and dinner most days in the sumptuous dining area right near the beach. Food was very well presented with many different varieties. This hotel does cater for and more towards the Europeans that stay there. We indulged in the spa not once but twice and found out that the spa girls were from Bali. So we spent some time talking about Bali as are regular travellers there. They are excellent spa girls and provide a wonderful experience. The only issue in general is that the Hotel is somewhat remote from any towns so shopping you have to travel a bit.,positive
"Heritance Ahungalla doesn't fail us ever. We were there just for one night, however the service was beyond expectations. The dinner buffet was absolutely gorgeous with so much of variety. And the best part was that they even had gluten free bread rolls served. Staff was ever so helpful. And the little ones enjoyed the pool and garden so much. Loved every bit of the short stay",positive
"We visited Heritance Ahungalla for a weekend getaway. It was a beautiful hotel with a very warm and comfortable atmosphere. Even though it rained most of the evening, we had a dip in the pool in the rain. It was an amazing experience. I very much recommend the Mustard Coffee shop for an evening coffee overlooking the beach and the sea. The buffet also had many varieties and was delicious. The staff were very welcoming, friendly and helpful. The room was very clean and comfortable while the bathroom was also spotless. We had a beautiful view of the ocean and a pool from the spacious balcony. TV and wifi works great. This hotel has some very unique architectural designs that made us feel very close to the ocean. I hope we will get to visit this beautiful place once more.",positive
"The Heritance provided a pleasing haven over 3 nights for our tour group as we desperately attempted to find flights out of Sri Lanka before Covid-19 sent the entire World into lockdown.Under the difficult circumstances of a mass exodus rapidly emptying the hotel of guests , the Heritance continued to function vey well . The staff remained delightfully friendly and extremely efficient . The buffet breakfasts and dinners suffered a slight reduction in the choices available , but still remained very good in terms of choice and tastiness. The hotel is well designed to provide an ambiance that is very relaxing , with a seamless juxtaposition between indoor and outdoor public areas . The design of the attractive pool fully reinforces this aspect. The overall impression gained is one of airiness and calm. Our first floor bedroom was quite spacious , the bed comfortable, the en suite well equipped , and the good-sized balcony allowed an excellent view of the adjacent beach. The air conditioning, TV, and WiFi all operated perfectly .The only fault we could find was that just ONE electric outlet was provided in the bedroom. Overall , we considered the Heritance provides a truly pleasant and relaxing experience , and we hope - should we ever be in Ahungalla again in happier circumstances - to stay here once more.",positive
"What a superb hotel this is. We stayed for our honeymoon and were looked after so well by the friendly staff. Nothing was too much trouble for them and all the facilities were excellent. Food was amazing and what a wide variety there was to choose from. The view onto the Indian Ocean from the pool was simply breathtaking and one that we will never forget. If you can find him on the beach there is a lovely man selling tours, his name is Pathmi and he looked after us so well for our stay. His prices are so much cheaper than the holiday company's and you will get to see the 'real' Sri Lanka with him. Seek him out and you won't be disappointed.",positive
"Amazing property, very clean and exceptional service. Staff are very professional, the food is good and the environment is fantastic. Lots of shopping around the hotel. The beach is amazing, and the pool too.",positive
"Heritance hotels has never failed us personally with their amazing hospitality and scrumptious food. First of all the management and staff has been very supportive to us in transferring a gift vacation from Kandalama to Ahungalla. The transition was purely since we have experienced the amazing facility at Kandalama many times and wanted a different experience. Right at the check-in, we were upgraded to a luxury room, (without request) and needless to mention the comfort, cleanliness and the facilities provided in the rooms were exceptional. Our room had two balconies with a beautiful view over the Indian Ocean and the crystal white sandy beaches of Sri Lankan southern coast. The hotels beach front is an ideal place to sit down and watch the sun set in the clean sands and to have a dip in the ocean. Hotel has two pools, one with Jacuzzis and a view which was a very relaxing experience. Food and the service of the restaurants were second to none with very friendly staff who were available to serve at a single call. Food experience as I expected was amazing as Heritance hotels never dissapoint me with the quality and the variety. Overall, we had an amazing holiday in a very warm hospitable environment surrounded with happy memories.",positive
"The property is beautiful, spacious and clean. Rooms are well kept. The food was excellent - various and tasty - and the staff at the restaurant very polite. All of the staff deserves a big praise - smiling, helpful, polite and always by your side, when you need something. Thank you so much!",positive
"Good property , but needs an upgraded. Food is ok Pool is nice to use when sun sets, Standard of Rooms and atmosphere needs to be improved A bit high priced in season , I think both Kandalama and Ahungalle do need an upgrade as properties got tourist attraction",neutral
"Hotel is perfect! One of my best trip! Hotel for very calm staying with family, food and spa nice quality. Location is good close for everything. Personal are very helpful. Only one minus that waives are very big, hard for comfortable swimming.",positive
"The Heritance ist a Synonym for excellence and a quality. Just in front of the beautiful beach, with a nice swimming Pool.Spacious rooms with balcony, a great choice and the quality of dishes, friendly and professionel staff.",positive
"Me my husband and our 11months year daughter visited Heritance and were not disappointed. It was a convinient hotel to be at with our daughter even though we have a stroller. The food has been great, the beach was clean and beautiful. What have really stood out though is the wonderful service from the crew at the restaurants, pool bars, pool service, reception and cleaning crew, wow, so kind and humble people. One particular member of Heritance named Rukmal also makes these amazing towel figures so you get so happy when coming back to the room to see what he has created this time :). Thank you Heritance for the wonderful stay.",positive
"Fantastic hotel with beautiful rooms and views, the friendliest and most helpful staff and stunning location. 2 amazing swimming pools both with bars and plenty of choice in the restaurant serving a wide variety of buffet food alongside themed dining evenings",positive
"We enjoyed our stay here. The room was nice and clean and the room boy friendly. Toiletries and mini bar. Lovely pools. Always managed to get a sun bed. The bar was busy of an evening with a good atmosphere. I think the only slight let down was the service in the restaurant. Always had to hunt someone down to order a drink, (we weren’t all inclusive). The tables never appeared to be reset as people had left. We entered the restaurant at 20.30 most nights and struggled to find a clean and set table. The food however was good with lots of choice. Nothing happening outside the hotel but tuk tuks and taxis were waiting outside the gate to take you anywhere you wanted to go.",positive
"Super hotel for the end of our stay. Great personal, always ready to help and smiling, like Rukmal. Food is just excellent and the pool really nice. Rooms were super clean and we enjoyed to find the elephant made with towels. We recommend this hotel to our friends.",positive
"I need to explain why I gave only 4 stars for this site. Worn down furniture, fungus in the shower, noisy air-conditioning, fan out of order, dirty walls with paint coming off… require general maintenance. That however wasn’t big issue as rooms and facilities were cleaned twice a day so no insects, no mosquitos… the shower gel and shampoo were so pleasant and good for skin that we bought it from the hotel and took home. The colonial design, equipment make the spot really great for rest. Additionally, there were no small children during our stay, no music played all day long (like in other resorts), no animations. In other words peaceful relaxing atmosphere. Superior room service (very attentive, smiling, helpful) as well as service in the restaurants, bars overcompensated any inconveniences related to the condition of the facilities. There was nice spa, billiard, beach volleyball and 2 big swimming pools with depth between 1 and 2.6m. There was also night club in the outer wing of the building so no disturbances during night. In the evening every day there were some shows and live music. Food in restaurant was reach, lot of seafood, curry, salads, sweets, fruits… all fresh and tasty. No big choice of drinks and local beer and wines were not too good. The weather in January was just fantastic: air temperature around 30C, ocean temperature 28C, very light breeze. Nonetheless the waves had around 1 m height and it was not recommended to swim far away from the beach due to reverse currents. Very long, wide and empty beach just aks to walk along. Just outside the hotel gates there were taxis and tuk-tuks which could drive you wherever one wants. I would definitely return to this hotel again (which I don’t say very often).",positive
Excellent hotel that is both visually stunning and has excellent facilities and service. Food was plentiful and had great choices. Got rose petals beautifully spread across my bed which was a lovely touch. Nothing is too much trouble here. Not a huge amount to do in Ahungalla but a great base for the surrounding area. Would recommend.,positive
"We stayed for 2 nights in Heritance. We were totally surprise by outstanding welcome by the staff. Fresh juices and easy check in, rooms are very spacious and neat. Everywhere is green and relaxing. Pools are highlights and walkable distance to beach. They have buffet system and regular ways too. It was delectable buffet with local caught of the day. My family enjoyed this safe haven. Taxi is available to local tours inside the resort. Pls negotiate the prices. Can be pricey sometimes. The whole resort is beautiful place. I will definitely come next year with my family. I will also recommend highly.",positive
"A great hotel. Staff all very friendly and helpful especially if you hand out a few tips! We stayed on a b&b basis and ate in the hotel most evenings as didn’t venture out too much. The meals were all very good and the breakfast buffet catered for most nationalities but the bacon, sausage, beans and an egg station for omelettes, fried etc. won over my husband! Plus endless fruits, pastries, oats, continental and of course Sri Lankan. Evening buffets equally as good for choice, also a fish restaurant, a Mexican and the coffee shop with a varied menu and all very affordable. The aqua aerobics was very good when it was on. Other activities included ping pong, beach volleyball, a gym, 2 pools, the beach with great waves and a spa! We saw so much wildlife including monkeys in the trees, Lena, lizards - small & large and loads of hermit crabs if you venture onto the beach at night! There is SO much to see in Sri Lanka so take some trips out and consider a 2 centre holiday if it’s your 1st visit.",positive
"The hotel is huge and pretty but not at par with other Heritance properties. We were upgraded to a suite room and it was very beautiful with all basic amenities. The pool and the beach was very clean. The dinner buffet and breakfast buffet was superb with a lot of options. Will definitely recommend the hotel in and around Bentota,",positive
Very creative bedroom decor by Room boy Sumudu. He is very courtiers & obliging. Well done. Keep up the good work. F&B maneger Rasika too was very courtiers & obliging. Pool table had not been maintained well. Full of dust & sand. Disappointing.,negative
"Good service, nice beach and good value for money. Rooms are okay and swimming pool is decent too. Was expecting more based on the pictures on website. We stayed here over the weekend, hotel was full and dinner time felt but crowded. However Food was excellent!",positive
Geoffrey Bawa is a master architect... find out why he is regarded so by visiting this masterpiece.... beautiful frames everywhere. The private beach is a joy to walk on. Day trips can be arranged to nearby villages and other Bawa properties.,positive
"Located on a wide expanse of soft sandy beach, this hotel was perfect for us to unwind and relax after 10 days of touring around the beautiful island of Sri Lanka. Comfortable, spacious rooms with outdoor seating on the balcony. Ample storage facilities. Bathroom was compact with a rain shower and toiletries provided. Plenty of food choices at meal times in the main dining area with themed evenings and choice of entertainment from late afternoon onwards. Friendly, attentive staff and our particular thanks to the chefs and the waiting staff in the dining room making our mealtimes an enjoyable experience. Plenty of sun beds available around both the swimming pools avoiding the need to reserve sun beds in advance. Convenient location for doing day trips for eg to Galle, moonstone mines. Confortable, air conditioned taxis are available at a reasonable price, bookable from Reception. Definitely worth considering if looking to stay in Ahungalla.",positive
"We recently spent two nights at the Heritance Ahungalla. We appeared to have spent our time there during their peak season as it felt a bit too crowded especially around the pool. Nevertheless, the staff were amazing in attending to our needs and strived to provide excellent customer service despite being incredibly busy. A special shout out to Mr. Prasad Priyanandana , the chief steward, who was always around to make sure the guests were well looked after - he went the extra mile to make sure our stay was a memorable one. We also had dinner at the Wadiya Grill Restaurant which we would would highly recommend for a beach side fresh seafood grill experience. In summary, a great beach escape with excellent customer service.",positive
"We had a beautiful experience staying at Heritance. The hotel is surperb across all categories- the rooms, service, food, staff attitude, hygiene. The pool and the beach access was also very good. If you are looking for a comfortable stay then this hotel is a good all inclusive package.",positive
"4 of us stayed here from the 7th to the 18th of January. We had originally booked the Turyya Hotel , also 5 STAR , but had a call from our tour operator MERCURY to see if we wanted to change to the Heritance because the Turyya had been downgraded to a 4 Star Hotel due to a lot of complaints. We were happy to book into the Heritance . But did not have the good experience that we had expected. Our rooms were quite dirty . So much so that my daughter cleaned her room with a packet of Babywipes. My Husband did some cleaning with a towel . I refused to do so . I do not think that this should be part of my Holiday. Then we checked our pillows and duvet and had a big shock. We took our bedding to the lobby and were quickly ushered in to a back room . After complaining we were offered an , as the Manager called it , an upgraded room. We were taken to have a look at the room and were happy to move in to it . It was actually exactly the same room as the dirty one but newly decorated with a new shower etc. Before we moved in to the new room the manager asked would it be Ok if he would go and check the bedding . Of course we agreed . At around 11 o'clock I heard loud voices from my daughters room . I went to see what was going on and again the bedding was dirty . Duvet cover had a big brown stain on it and one of the pillows had mould all over it. The manager told us "" that is why we put 2 pillow cases on it "" OH DEAR !!!!!! But after that , I must praise the boys who cleaned our room , everything was spotless. The next day at mealtimes we were surprised that the restaurant staff seemed to be totally confused . It was a bit like FAULY TOWERS . There were other issues but it would take to long to mention them all . Would we come back to this Hotel . absolutely not , never ever .",negative
"Me and my wife stayed at the Heritance Ahungalla for our honeymoon and I can't stress enough how brilliant this hotel is. When we arrived we had some welcome drinks and were congratulated on our wedding. The staff couldn't have made us feel any better, we had a congratulations cake sitting on our room one evening, a bottle of wine with two glasses on another and our room was upgraded, all due to it being our honeymoon. Thivanka/Cassim were brilliant around the green pool bar for both local information and good service, Rebecca in the restaurant was always smiling and helpful, and the cleaning staff were always happy to see you and made the rooms look great. We also went on a few excursions with a local tour company and the hotel were happy to make us an early breakfast and lunch for early pick ups (one was at 2:30am and 2 pick ups we're at 4:30am) which was very kind. These packed breakfast/lunch bags were full to the brim with sandwiches, fruit, water, juices etc. It was a really nice touch and was free for us (staying all inclusive). The hotel itself is beautiful from every angle. At night, the front really makes a great backdrop for pictures and both pools lead onto the beach. The green pool is definitely the best place to spend the day if you're looking to relax. Keep an eye out for the monitor lizards that roam the grounds, the monkeys that come every few days and other wildlife that really adds to the hotel. Ahungalla beach is beautiful and is okay to paddle in, but the current is a bit too strong to swim in. I noticed that after a few minutes of floating I would probably be around 8 meters down from where I started. There are a lot of local tour guides and sarong sellers that will bug you once you leave the hotel to the beach (or if they see you on the way back) which is the only downside, but this is out of the hotels control. The restaurants level of food is diverse, offering both local dishes alongside a wide range of international food. We're not usually a couple to go back to the same place twice, but me and my wife would both love to come back to this hotel in the future to possibly spend a wedding anniversary. I really can't stress enough how much we loved the Heritance Ahungalla and were made to feel at home. We found nothing that we could complain about, everything felt premium and 5*, and we enjoyed every minute of our 11 day stay there.",positive
"We stayed here for 4 nights at the end of our Sri Lanka trip in 2 rooms.impressive driveway and entrance lobby and friendly greeting and check in .Rooms are large and had good views to the garden and towards the sea, well equipped and very clean with great service from our daily room attendant, although on arrival both rooms had cockroaches but he dealt with these swiftly and they did not reappear, comfortable beds and nice linens and towels. No signage to any of facilities such as gym. Great pools and very spacious gardens and lots of sun beds with good service from pool attendants.The major disappointment was the attitude of bar staff and some of restaurant staff to all inclusive guests, unfriendly and unhelpful to the point of rudeness! Why offer an all inclusive option and then treat these guests as second class citizens? We were frequently ignored in the bar area and bills presented in a manner which suggested you shouldn't order anymore! Totally spoilt what otherwise would have been a very pleasant stay.",negative
"Arrived into Sri Lanka Jan 15th to start a 6day tour, on completion was dropped off at this hotel to be greeted with the warmest of welcomes then to be told I had been upgraded to a Luxury Deluxe room was the perfect start it was fab and very close to the quieter 2nd pool and on the ground floor soon I had the privelidge to meet my room attendant Rukmal who was so nice and friendly and very handy with towels as you will see in my pics we got on so well and he was always their to help if I needed anything.I have really enjoyed my stay here the staff are so nice,the food is excellent and for me it's been one of the most peaceful,relaxing places you could ever wish to visit.I would not hesitate to return thankyou Heritance for making my sri lankan holiday so special 🇱🇰😎☀️👍",positive
"We booked a different Hotel in Kalutara for our wedding anniversary, but a few weeks before we were due to travel we were informed that our hotel of choice had been down graded from a 5 to 4 star and that we could have a small refund or a move to the Heritance Ahungalla. We chose to move and I am so glad that we did. Our trip was also tinged with a certain amount of sadness as my father in law passed away recently and it would have been his 90th birthday while we were on holiday. \this holiday was always going to be a tough one for my wife. On top of that my wife has a condition that means that she tires very easily and can on occasions have mobility issues. We arrived by car in the afternoon and were driven in through the security gates and were warmly met by Trilishiya in the reception area. She checked us in while we had a welcome drink and then took us to our 2nd floor room (Lift access) Our room was spacious, clean and well appointed. It had little extras like bathrobes, flip flops, and a host of toiletries. The air conditioning was brilliant and so quiet. There were only net curtains at the window for privacy but it had floor to ceiling shutters ensuring complete blackout at night. Bliss! The french doors led out onto a large terrace with a view over the pool and is one of the few rooms in the hotel with a completely clear view of the sea. Most of the sea view rooms have palm trees and other planting obscuring a clear sea view. The Hotel is built in a Colonial modernist style, is no more than 3 storeys high and has open courtyards within the building full of palm trees and gardens. The Reception area and mirror lounge are open on 2 sides giving the hotel a sense of light and space and successfully brings the outside in doors. We had booked an all inclusive package, which in this case does include almost everything (local Labels) Meals are served in the main restaurant and are buffet style with drinks waiter service. The food is Excellent with a wide range of salad, main courses and desserts. There is something for everyone. There is a selection of European foods (thankfully, no chips!!) at every sitting, but the best food is the Sri Lankan food that is available. Amazing curries, rices and side pickles and dishes Absolutely delicious. Snacks are available at the pool bar when the main restaurant is closed. There is a fine dining restaurant (the Upper Room) that we ate at on our wedding anniversary serving excellent European food. Wadiya shack in the grounds serves amazing sea food. Do get the lobster, so tasty!!! There are 2 pools at the hotel. One is strictly for residents and is further away from the main areas but it has its own snack bar. The main pool is literally off ( and inside) the reception area. When you are in the pool it appears that you are in an infinity pool looking out over the Indian Ocean. This pool is open to non residents but we never found that to be a problem. There are plenty of sunbeds around the pools with comfy mattresses and plenty of towels are provided. From the main pool you have direct access to the wide clean sandy beach. You can walk for miles. The sea can be rough and there can be some very strong rip tides. Caution is advised at all times when in the water. The Hotel does have Life Guards but they are stationed up near the main pool. The crowning glory in this hotel are it's staff.I have never seen or met a more friendly, polite and smiley crew. They are all immaculately turned out and NOTHING, and I mean nothing is too much trouble. The service is unbelievably good. The staff are so friendly and are genuinely interested in your lives and are so grateful when you ask about their lives and families. We saw so many family photos! On our first evening, My wife tripped on uneven paving near the pool on her way to the Bathroom. She split open her left knee and ""went over"" on her right ankle. The staff were incredible at making sure she was OK. The couple of days later her ankle was still swollen and she just mentioned to Trilishiya that life would be easier if we had sunbeds on our terrace. Within 20 mins 4 men turned up at our door with 2 sunbeds, 2 mattresses and 4 beach towels. Talk about service I have to mention some people by name because they made our stay so memorable and this list includes staff from all levels Rasika,The F & B Manager. A true gentleman who was understood our needs so well and was always there to greet us at meal times Tusara, The Restaurant manager, always making sure that we had what we needed Rebecca, one of the hosts , who every night took the time to explain the Sri Lankan desserts to me (Plus I will admit to being just a little in love with this Beautiful young lady! ! Don't tell the wife!!) Darsharna. The pool barman who tended to our drinks needs wonderfully and when he found out about my father in law, went the next day to the Buddhist temple to pray for him. This reduced my wife to a quivering wreck! Trilishiya, the receptionist who looked after us and has become a friend and who instigated all of the amazing service and never failed to come and find us everyday.On the days my wife couldn't make it downstairs she would come to the room or telephone to make sure that she was OK. We had an amazing stay at this hotel and would stay again in a heart beat. I want to make it clear that the next comment in no way reflects upon the staff above or any others employed by the hotel it is aimed directly at the General Manager of Heritance Ahungalla and at the people in charge of major property renovation at Aiken Spence head office. The floor area around the main swimming pool and the pool bar at Heritance Ahungalla is a disaster waiting to happen. At the very least you may have a large legal claim on your hands at worst someone could kill themselves. The coverings to the pool drainage ducts are poorly secured and in may cases completely loose. The tiling around the pool is uneven, poorly grouted and constitutes a serious trip hazard. This is not a job for the in house maintenance team .A number of staff members told us that this had already been reported a number of times and that nothing had been done about it. Regardless of timing, number of guests this needs serious capital investment immediately.",positive
"We visited this hotel at the end of a group tour and were very disappointed with our accommodation. The other members of the group were given different quality rooms despite having paid the same and were mostly very happy but our room was unacceptable. ( I think from the website images it was a ‘deluxe’ room with partial sea view) The electrics in this part of the hotel were obviously in need of urgent renovation. Two of the plug sockets were damaged with melted plastic around the pin holes and the air conditioning would only work at all by fiddling with the slider switch on the wall and then went off again after a couple of minutes. We complained and a manager said they would sort out the plug sockets the next day but asserted that the air conditioning WAS working although obviously it was not and the room remained very warm. Apparently the hotel was fully booked and there was nothing he could do about it. I was online looking for alternative accommodation when the situation was resolved by our tour guide who generously swopped rooms with us and this room was lovely. Although the electrics were our main complaint, the room also smelled damp and was generally in need of renovation, not really five star. The rest of the hotel was very good and the restaurant was excellent so our experience was a great shame. (Although a word of caution re check out- all members of the group found that they had paid their bills in pounds with a poor exchange rate although the invoice was in rupees and nobody was asked about paying in sterling)",negative
"We loved it here. It was amazing. The staff are lovely and helpful. Perfect. We booked a family room for 6 nights. We were travelling with our two young daughters. From the time, we stepped in, we were treated so well. We booked a Luxury Family Room with two twin beds and one double bed on the website. We also booked the all inclusive package which included all our food, drinks, snacks while we were there. I recommend this package. You don’t have to worry about anything. You can skip the buffets and just have sandwiches by the pool, cocktails and beer are included and wine with dinner. Excellent. The room was spacious and had plenty of room for 4 of us, with a lovely view of the quiet pool. There was a balcony which was handy for drying swimsuits for the next day. The bathroom was well equipped. The staff were attentive- we had to call housekeeping as our daughter had been ill overnight. The next morning, the room attendants turned up early to ask for dirty clothes to wash and if we needed any help. When my husband wasn’t well, they offered to send food up to our room. There were activities for children: cupcakes, towel animals, mocktails, a magician, puppet shows. There were fish to feed. There were squirrels, crabs, monkeys and lizards to see. Our kids loved it. Locals sell trinkets on the beach and there were local crafts to buy. No one is allowed to be a nuisance and pushy- which was really good. Special staff were Sunethra who booked our trip, and the lovely hostesses",positive
"This hotel is classy, beautifully designed, low rise with wonderful integration of trees, plants and water features within the hotel and the grounds making it feel very peaceful and not destroying the local wildlife, just compare it with the white hulk of the RUI hotel next door! There are two large pools and of course the stunning beach, although the sea is not suitable for swimming because of the rip currents and large waves. A multitude of staff of all categories tirelessly work to offer excellent service. Areas are constantly being repainted and the grounds manicured by the gardeners. The food is wonderful, there was plenty of western dishes on offer but I almost exclusively enjoyed the wide range of sri lankan dishes with chili crab being a favourite and many dishes of large prawns, having the local ""hoppa"" at breakfast was great. I thought the hotel offered a quality experience and would happily return as it is clear many people do. There are lots of excursions on offer but do your research and shop around because prices differ a lot and there are people on the beach who will seek to sell you tours, a driver, clothing, well almost anything.",positive
Good facilities especially the two pools. The rooms are large and clean enough but if you look too closely you start to notice just how much cleaner it should be. The shower had black mould in the lower corners and the floor tiles had stains. They are repainting the outside but they have a long way to go. I wouldn’t let this stop you too much to stay here as everything else is good. The seafood dinner outside was delicious with Lobster and prawns and mullet fish all good. The lighting in the bathroom was very good and the was a magnifying mirror.,positive
"This was our third time at the hotel. We were married on the beach when the hotel was the Triton, visited again on our 10th anniversary and have just returned from our third trip there. The hotel is as lovely as ever and makes for a really relaxing holiday in a beautiful setting. There are plenty of opportunities for excursions to see more of this fantastic country but it's also lovely to relax by the pools or wander along the stunning beach, especially at sunset. The staff throughout the hotel were excellent; from the reception staff at check-in, the restaurant staff, waiters, pool staff ... All were very helpful, friendly and gave a great service throughout our stay. We booked on an all inclusive basis and the food was always very good and plentiful. The staff also arranged a romantic 4-course meal on the beach for us which was superb. Would thoroughly recommend the hotel and we are already planning our next trip back there! Thanks to all the staff who helped make our holiday so enjoyable.",positive

"Once you visit Heritance Ahungalla,you don’t feel like going anywhere else.Every holiday that we spent with them,was fabulous.Mr.Thushara,the food and beverage manager is actually the main reason why we come to Heritance Ahungalla.His service goes beyond his title.He’s exceptionally helpful,super friendly and he knows exactly what the guest wants in a five Star hotel.Our family adores him, not only as a professional but also as a great friend.We would like to thank Mr.Thushara,Mr.Nipun,and the rest of the staff at Heritance Ahungalla,for all their efforts to keep everyone satisfied.Once again,Thank you,Mr.Thushara,for being so caring and always willing to give us the best.",positive
"This property was designed by the famous Sri Lankan genius architect, Geoffrey Bawa that incorporates the natural setting into the structure. Beautiful large infinity style pool, efficient checkin, high speed Internet, helpful staff, excellent restaurants, beachside location, and high security. The property is enclosed and away from the main road. This was my third visit, and is one of my favorite resorts. Some ambitious beach sales people have beach clothes and table cloths for sale. Overall, a private place where you can relax. Full and half board is available. I recommend half board, so you can try the poolside and club room restaurants. You have the option to get half board lunch or dinner. There’s sundowner cocktails available. Gem sales on the property, as well as across the street. Optional trips available as you’re not too far from Galle Fort, and once we went deep sea diving in some caves south along the coastline near Hikkaduwa. Hotel can suggest trips even to Bawa’s former residence and his brother’s eccentric home/garden. Highly recommend!",positive
It’s a good hotel and the room with view was amazing .people was polite and so kind here and each group stay alone . In dinner there was music cultural party so great . Food in restaurant so delicious specially the original Srilanka food . Next time we should spent one week as minimum to enjoy 😉,positive
"We spent 10 nights in this resort and it was absolutely fabulous. The ocean was so accessible from the hotel and the hotel itself was spotless and spacious. The food was well presented and there was a huge choice, although it did become a little samey after a while, but the buffet could not be crticised. The staff was always available and willing to help. I must mention Darshana in particular,who was alwas smiling and seemed to recognise us after a few days.",positive
"We are currently enjoying a 5 night stay at the Heritance hotel and having a wonderfully relaxing time. The staff here are so friendly and ever ready to help with huge and genuine smiles on their faces. Our baby has also been given special attention and we have been made to feel so welcome here. A special mention to Rukmal who cleaned our room every day. He was so friendly, cleaned our rooms beautifully, and did the most amazing towel art on our beds. Each day it was a lovely surprise and we look forward to seeing what he makes tomorrow!",positive
"We ended off our holiday in Sri Lanka at this hotel, booked in for 3 nights. It was a perfect decision as it was pure bliss and relaxation. The hotel offers various amenities to allow you to unwind, with two swimming pools (one overlooking the ocean and another more secluded) while being situated along the beach from where you can take a dip into the ocean. Other amenities include table tennis, a gym and in-house entertainment such as live music and performances. The staff service is friendly, efficient and professional, while the food is good (not too spicy overall but a decent array to choose from). Our dining experience was made memorable with exceptional service from Malake during breakfasts and dinners. The rooms were clean, comfortable and spacious with a balcony overlooking the ocean. The hotel premises were always kept neat and tidy while offering sufficient space to walk around or relax on a pool chair. Overall I would certainly recommended this hotel to any couple or family looking for a place to relax and unwind while being taken care of at a world-class and luxury hotel. Many thanks.",positive
Heritance Ahungalla is a Lovely Beach property approx 2 hours away from Colombo. The staff was extremely warm and friendly. Lakshita (AFM) and Nipun Sameera (Restaurant Manager) and the team made our stay memorable. The New Year party was magnificent rounding off with a great display of fireworks on the beach.,positive

"Nice ambience with a 2 pool options and splendid beach , good dining options , eveng entertainment at lobby , not far from colombo , nice staff , dinner buffet options better than other resorts , good indian options too , suggest to have more entertainment options",positive
"Worst hotel I ever stayed at. Beautiful location though, although strong undercurrents so we could not swim in the ocean. Rooms terrible, staff not service minded at all. Everything worn down. Bed sheets dirty, cats running around inside the hotel. Absolutely not a 5 star hotel, would not even give it 1 star. Stay away, do not ever ever under any circumstances go there.",negative
The hotel is located near the beach and location is good. But the hospitality is not so good. Room is also not up to the mark as the sliding door of the bathroom was jammed and room was not cleaned before handing to us. The food was ok ok but catering staff was courteous. Try for Taj Bentota instead.,neutral
Location perfect. hotel is run down - needs TLC. Service is great at all times but prices at main buffet are ridiculous. WiFi is stable and reliable everywhere. Beach is awesome and pool area is great. Bar restaurant is good. Entertainment in the evening is 3rd. Rate and needs to be upgraded. Hotel was great in it’s heigh day but needs major updates to make it current. Staff try’s to cope with issues at all times.,neutral
This is one of the best hotels which you can find in this beautiful island. Friendly staff. Clean rooms and facilities are over the moon. Nothing to complain about. Worth the money you spent. Good vibes.,positive
"Heritance Ahungalla was the second Heritance hotel we stayed in after Kandalama and we were not disappointed! I thought that after our fantastic experience at Heritance Kandalama, it may be a let down but it definitely was not. Similar courtesy, cleanliness and amazing food!",positive
"The room itself was okay, relatively clean and fair in size. My biggest issue with the stay was that, when relaxing or walking on the beach, there were around 15ish street merchants constantly harassing me and other guests to buy their clothes (at extortionate prices compared to going to a local shop or market), as well as being badgered to book tours, again at 2-3 times the price when booking away from the beach. I have to point out that these were not hotel employees, but independent traders whom for some reason had access to the hotel every day we stayed there. The hotel offers a baggage handling service where they will move your bags to and from your room for you free of charge, however, be vigilant as personal items were stolen from our luggage between us leaving the room to checkout, and our bags being moved by one of the staff members. In all honesty, I have stayed at many hotels in different countries and I would say, this is the one time I have gone on holiday and not felt like I was actually on holiday as there was just that much badgering going on that it was almost impossible to relax. Upon walking out of the front gates of the hotel, you would have 4-5 tuk tuk drivers ask and try to take you to places you have repeatedly told them you do not wish to go and although this is not the hotel's fault, when it happens every single day, I feel as though it has to be mentioned. Anyone considering going to Sri Lanka, I recommend it - just consider staying somewhere else because for me, this was a 5-star mistake.",neutral
"Lovely location and rooms are clean and spacious... Rukmal makes fun towel sculptures... see phot below! All the staff from housekeeping, dining rooms, bars and reception are kind, cheery and helpful... the dining staff are always on hand to discuss local food with us and where is worth visiting in the local area. Great location and beautiful hotel designed by renowned architect Geoffrey Bawa, all rooms are sea view and what a view! Hotel grounds are lush and full of beautiful sweet smelling frangipani trees. 2 pools mean you can find peace away from the day guests and children playing ball games in the residents only pool... or watch the games and enjoy the playful young ones. We had a noisy room, over the main bar area with live music until 11pm each day... when we asked to move, we were in a new room within a few hours. We love our quiet new room on the 3rd/top floor... this holiday is a rest and relax time for us... Together with our comfortable beds (with sprung mattresses) that’s what we now have 😊 If you are in the UK... we booked via Mercury Direct as we’ve used them before and they are great. Our local rep, Malkauter lovely and helpful... not at all pushy, as we’ve had with other companies.",positive
"3 nights here.. by the coast... hotel was built by Geoffrey Bawa.. very good place The room we had was massive... clean and tidy.. with big tv, mini bar... huge bathroom The view of the coast was awesome...the breakfasts and dinners were all very nice The hotel staff were all friendly A very good place",positive
"Had the pleasure of staying two nights. We have been many times before and this was again an excellent stay. The amenities and services was 5 star as was the hospitality. Special thank you to GM Sisira Senanayake, Thushara, Rasika, Shanika and the pool attendants and all the staff.",positive
"It’s a beautiful created by the famous architect Geoffrey Bawa. However more than the unique architecture, the hotel is renowned for its delectable cuisine. Some areas of the hotel, like the corridor floors need to be re painted. Had trouble finding pool towels cuz there was one person assigned for that task and he was not present all the time. However their food will never disappoint you. Will return again.",neutral
Ms supunika took very good care of us as did the whole staff. We got suite room and twin luxury rooms 201 and 203. Immaculately clean. Awesome pool we played polo. Table tennis badminton everything is available. Beach was also nice. Rough sand. The breakfast spread was amazing.,positive
"A 5 star stay. From the service to the food and the ambiance, a must visit beach hotel in the south of sri lanka. An old bawa hotel, some refurbishment has taken place. The rooms have been tastefully redone. Had a most enjoyable visit.",positive
"A beautiful stylish hotel with the most interesting architecture and interior design ; Mackintosh meets Bauhaus ! Very charming and super - friendly service all round. Breakfast to die for. A shame about the lack of beach weather in September , but Dec- March would be better .",positive
"I think this one of the worst places I have ever seen. Very bad experince with the reception team. No smiles, they want to charge me for the air I am breathing. They intentionally selected a very far away room although we are a family. They know it is one night so we will have no time to complain and request room change.",negative
"A great place to relax and unwind. The hotel is clean and staff are very friendly, especially Rukmal who went out of his way to help my family. He also showcased beautiful towel art after he tidied up our room. I would highly recommend this hotel for a Sri Lankan getaway.",positive
"We travelled around Sri Lanka for 2 weeks staying in 6 different hotels, and this was by far the worst service we received out of our entire stay. The hotel itself is nice, rooms spacious and clean, pool area is nice. We dined in the a la carte restaurant which was nice. Don’t bother with half board / all inclusive - there’s a handful of restaurants on the beach with better food. The worst part is there seems to be some American expectation of tipping for absolutely everything, and if you don’t then you simply won’t get served!! Despite many signs around the pool saying sunbeds can’t be reserved, it seems the pool boy is more than happy to reserve these for a tip. I was up at 7:30am (jetlag), and there was just 1 set of sunbeds left despite no one actually being by the pool! We stayed there until midday, and some of the reserved beds only became occupied at 11am! So frustrating for everyone else. One woman took the reservation off and the pool boy flat out refused to give her a towel, even arguing with her! She went and got her own, and by midday no one had come to claim the bed! Awful! We went to the bar one night, they saw us walk in. They proceeded to offer every other group table service but us! I had to go to the bar 3 times for menus, drink etc., yet they still charged 10% service! On check-out you get shoved in some tiny room round back to pay your bill which is actually quite intimidating. No one asked if we had a nice stay or where we were going next, or even said bye when we left! While I do appreciate Sri Lanka is a poor country and tipping is needed, this was the only hotel during our whole trip that had this greedy mentality. We saved hard for this trip and don’t appreciate being treated like lesser people because we don’t have lots of extra money for tips! They also seem to have no problem in letting touts in to the hotel who come up to you on your sunbed to sell you a sari! I get that this happens on the beach but they shouldn’t allow them in the hotel grounds.",negative
"This hotel has wonderful staff. Always smiling, welcoming and warm towards their guests. They go the extra mile as shown by the towel at that greeted us in the afternoon. A great way to relax and unwind aftera busy trip around the island.",positive
A wonderful resort to finish our Sri Lanka experience. Beautiful surrounds & excellent staff . The housekeeping staff especially Rukmal was so friendly. Wow the towel art to another level. Food delicious & we return home feeling very relaxed after seeing this amazing country .,positive
"This was our second visit to the hotel, we had another very enjoyable 14 night stay. The food was excellent, great verity on offer each day. Would highly recommend trying the fresh lobster in the Wadiya seafood restaurant. One of the evenings there was a Sri Lankan theme night in the Jute restaurant, Duminda took the time to explain the different types of food on offer and which occasions these would be used for. Both Thushara and Duminda really went out their way to ensure dining in the restaurant was a pleasurable experience and always on hand to help. Our room was cleaned to a high standard daily mainly by Rukual, we really enjoyed his towel art. The green pool area was spotless and clean, Dinesh ensured we had plenty of towels and always greeted us with a smile, nothing was ever too much trouble for him. Getting a taxi or tuktuk is easy, just a short walk to the main gate, The entertainment was a bit hit and miss on some evenings. But otherwise this is a great hotel to stay in. Thank you to all the members of staff that really did go that extra mile ensuring that our stay was perfect, you are all a credit to this hotel! We are looking forward to our return next year!",positive
"We had a splendid day out with our office staff families at Hesitance and Every staff member with whom we came in contact was attentive, kind and professional including receptionists, room service staff, animation team. Specially would like to thank Rasika, Nipuna and Thushara from F&B department who assist us to make out day a memorable one.",positive
The hotel is beautiful and the pool area is the best place to spend your time. They have an extensive range of amazing food. The hotel staff are very friendly and accommodating. Rukmal from housekeeping made up the cutest towel figureins when cleaning up the room. Loves them! The beach is lovely for an early morning walk. Best place to come over and unwind.,positive
We are frequent travellers to Sri Lanka and were first time stayers at this magnificent resort. We were celebrating the anniversary and an engagement of our granddaughters and their partners. The look of amazement was captured in memory only as it was all a surprise made possible by Sunethra Lamahewa and her team. Thank you so much for your professionalism and attending to detail. The staff were extremely friendly and courteous and always willing to help. The meals were outstanding too as was the whole resort. A great experience!,positive
"We stayed in room 145, ocean-view with balcony, the two large trees obstructed any view and we had to be satisfied with listening to the waves pounding the shoreline. We were unlucky with the weather, windy and wet, and it influences my rating decision as we were really unable to fully enjoy the hotel facilities. Our room was spacious, the sliding panels in front of the balcony window rendering the room virtually soundproof when closed. Lighting in the room was poor. The bed was comfortable and we enjoyed great sleeps. Great shower area, and ample quality toiletries provided. Lovely infinity pool between reception and the beachfront. We were treated to a Christmas Cake mixing display in the lobby; wish that I could return for Christmas and sample a slice or two of the finished product. Great staff throughout, courteous and efficient and always greeting the guest with a smile. Both my wife and I agreed that the Heritance would be a lovely resort to enjoy a relaxing holiday.",positive
"Warm welcome and friendly and helpful staff, located by the beach and having 2 pools for the times of high waves, great ocean view, 2 restaurants and a bar with amazing music, nice daily programs by hotel including activities for children as well as elders, nice music every night by the bar, very good food, clean rooms, excellent service, will recommend and will go again for sure",positive
"What a nice hotel to stay. Beautiful swimming pools and rooms,We stayed 2 nights and very comfortable place. Reception and Customer services are exceptional. Special thanks to Rasika, Duminda, Kenny and Nipun.",positive
"Stayed at the Heritance Ahungalla. Despite a local storm this week had a great time. The customer service is exceptional, especially the restaurant manager Diminda. Great pools. Very rough sea so not possible to swim but the beach was great. Evening entertainment with bands and fire eaters. When it stopped racing they had aquarobics. My wife a f daughter enjoyed the spa massage as well. The breakfast and evening buffets were great. As a vegetarian I had loads to eat. Overall a great stay exceptional and attentive service. Highly recommended for a family. Well maintained and beautiful",positive
"The room that was given to us was spacious,clean and had plenty of space for the kids to move around.. everything that we requested was arranged for us prior to our arrival so waiting time was less thanks to shanika. The cots were comfortable.food was good with a range of varieties.food for the kids was prepared specially and was ensured to be sent to the room on time thanks to the banquet team and Duminda. Definitely will be back again! The kids and we loved our stay here.",positive
"While the big waves pounding, staying inside a cool Aircon room is another choice, or dip in the nice beach side pool, or just dive in the ocean! Well equipped hotel, must say, for all ages, there is game room, literary room, gym of course, bar, cigar/smoking room! They sure well thought of all different levels! Great hotel n staffs!",positive
We visited this property during last weekend.The hotel staff were so friendly and helpful from the reception onwards.Rooms were spacious and clean.There were so many varieties in the buffet and the foods were so delicious.Thank you for providing a wonderful experience.,positive
"Our first stay with the Heritance group and we thoroughly enjoyed our 2 nights here. The waterfront location is ideal and although we didn’t get into the water at the beach we did enjoy walking along the beach. The rooms are comfortable and spacious, the bathroom is on the smaller side for what I would expect for a hotel of this standard but was clean and well equipped. The restaurant was good and the food range was acceptable with traditional Sri Lankan as well as Western options. The cultural show on our second night there was also a good experience.",positive
"My recent stay at Heritance Ahungalle was an absolute memorable one. On October 21st 2019, I was proposed to by my now finance, Tim Thatcher Tim worked with my parents and the amazing staff at the resort to organize a memorable evening for me and my whole family. We had beautiful rooms, food and entertainment for the evening. Especially, the staff helped organize and execute the proposal by providing us with an intimate space, a spectacular four course candle lit dinner (with a specialized menu featuring our event), full table service, photographers, flower arrangements and overall wonderful hospitality. I want to express my sincere gratitude to the team at Heritance Ahungalle, Mr. Rasika (F&B manager) Mr. Thushara (Restaurant Manager), Mr. Sisira (GM) and their teams for allowing us to execute Tim's vision. It was a very special day surrounded by my friends and family and it wouldn't have been a possibility without the support of this team. Heritance Ahungalle lives and embodies the true Sri Lankan hospitality and service. Thank you to all!!!",positive
We are a spoilt family when it comes to medium to luxury travels. Therefore this review is based on comparison of this hotel against many others in Sri Lanka. Our stay in this hotel was relaxing and welcoming. The rooms are comfortable and clean and the staff are super friendly. Whilst not the most demanding of customers we were made to feel like nothing was a bother to them. Attention to detail and care was taken by the staff. Special thanks to Dumindha who represented his hotel very well. Recommended. Note However this is not a hotel if you want to swim in the sea. Currents are incredibly strong and dangerous. Now for some points to improve: The hotel is looking tired and needs a modicum of renovation. The walkway floors and hallways can get very slippery when the rain comes in. It’s all open and is a hazard. The reception staff were eager to workout when we aim to checkout. They could tone that down.,neutral
"Heritable Ahungalla is a must visit in Sri Lanka. We had an amazing stay from check in (Miss Thirindi - efficient, pleasant and professional ) to check out. The hotel design (Bawa) fits the environment perfectly but the staff are the ones who made our stay amazing! Make sure you try the great seafood prepared by Chef Chandanna and his team. Also, Duminda (restaurant manager) gave us excellent service and recommendations- most senior staff have foreign experience so understand what world class service and food is! All staff are humble, professional and efficient .... great culture! P.s - if you feel like some fun activities ask for Raju - tennis, table tennis, badminton, pool - he can do it all and is very helpful!",positive
Had a great time and well organized hotel with Great staff and special thanks to Shanika and DInushi .....for getting the midnight surprise birthday....thanks for the lovely memories and making it special event,positive
The property is located right in front of the beach and the beach is barely 20 steps from the reception. We reached the hotel at around sunset. We skipped all formalities and ran to the beach because the view was simply splendid. The staff is very hospitable and accommodating. The chef at the restaurant made us Indian food at our request although the buffet menu did not have it. A special hat tip to Rukmal from housekeeping who did up our room beautifully when we were away - with flower petals strewn around and towel swans.,positive
Friendly staff.tasty food with good spread in lunch & dinner.special thx to the staff as we were upgraded to a luxury room. It would be better if the hotel staff can cosider to improve breakfast spread & keeping life guard in pool area.,positive
"The hotel lobby, pool and facilities are large and nice. The beach is good but not suitable for swimming. Rooms are clean. WiFi service is free and of good quality. The location is near to many attractions.",positive
Beautiful hotel with atmost luxury in golden sands of Ahungalla. The hotel was tastefully desighned for at most comfort with spacious rooms. The rooms are very clean and well maintained. The food spread is mouth watering with international varaties. The food is very tasty and healthy. The staff is very friendly and nice with smiling faces. The room service is very efficient with care. A beautiful spa to get energised and refreshing. Overall it is a best property in the south costal belt of Sri Lanka.,positive
"As soon we enter the gates , drove through a beautiful garden to get to this hotel, I like this hotel. we were welcome by a very nice lady in a very traditional way and offered complementary drinks. Our room face the sea with a very beautiful view of the sea and the pool. This hotel was designed by a very famous architect JEFFREY BAUER. We have a very nice and spacious room.Breakfast and dinner was excellent with a very comprehensive mouth watering buffet.The staff was very nice, very good customer service.",positive
We visited this hotel possibly for the fourth time and still are happy about the ambiance and service. Food was great and rooms comfortable.Staff was helpful. Hotel is a creation of legendary Jeffry Bawa and still looks good.,positive
"It's such a pleasure to go around this beautifully laid-out hotel and encounter their ever-smiling and helpful staff. Special mention of Rukmal, the talented gentleman who always cleaned up my room and left beautiful towel art creations on my bed. Today he put 2 of my hairclips on the dog he made and it made me smile when I entered my room and I haven't stopped smiling yet (just like Rukmal) :-) Lovely location, great attitude of staff, comfortable room, good food... my first solo vacation is perfect.",positive
"We spent a day in this beautiful seaside hotel in mid November. It is located along the southern coastline of Sri Lanka. The famous bawa design of the hotel is amazing. The view of the beach along the front swimming pool was stunning. The staff was friendly and offered a good hospitality. We spent more in the outdoor pool. It was awesome. Food were great. Rooms were comfy, neat and equipped with all amenities. Highly recommend for a family stay or for a office day out.",positive
Excellent hotel lovely staff. Had a wonderful time. I would advised management of this hotel to stop tourist visiting and purchasing from Aida gems Bentota.it would not be somthing you would wish your hotel to be associated with. Extremely poor quality work and dishonesty . You will see many very poor reviews mounting to include our own experience. I cannot express myself more to keep away from this dealer. Items will break and gems will fall out. You will not receive any interest in after sales service. Please please share these reviews to others. Thank you for reading.,negative
"A beautiful hotel set on the beach, and while it is showing signs of age this is more than offset by its charm. The staff were delightful, friendly and helpful. Cleaning was excellent. The buffet dinners and breakfasts are of a very high standard. I would certainly stay here again.",positive
"It was a very pleasant Day-out with family & friends at this great location. It was my first time here and was very pleased with the services offered, Specially, Duminda who helped out from the time I called for the reservation and Dilrukshi who received us in a cordial manner and given us a lot of attention. Thanks Duminda for looking after the buffet reservation and co-ordination of the boat trip in Madu river. We had a great time. Small productive criticism - the bathroom amenities were not provided in the room allocated with the pool use. The shower area is too small according to the people used them and needs more space. Hope these comments are helpful to the relevant Managers in the future. Kind Regards to every one. Deepani Kapuruge",positive
Stayed here for three nights and loved it. Great staff Always willing to go the extra mile and so very friendly. Even the gardening staff always smiling. Room fabulous overlooking the smaller pool which was an added bonus. Food special. Had buffet for breakfast and dinner.,positive
We stayed at this resort for 2 days and loved it. They’ve got 2 pools but we’ve been swimming in the main pool. Our rooms were facing the pool and the ocean so the view was beautiful. The food was lovely. They had a bit of everything from authentic srilankan food such as hoppers to seafood such as prawn and fish. Would definitely stay at Heritance Ahungalla on our next visit to Sri Lanka.,positive
"Checked in to Heritance with office friends.. very spacious, modern hotel with old world charm.. some historical artefacts preserved within the hotel was interesting. Loved the jacuzzi and the mini- football table at the hotel. Has 3 separate pools and a clean beach. Rooms have the appearance of a wooden-look, old fashioned train station! But very comfortable..",positive
The stay was Excellento! Me and my family had a great time there. The food was really great especially dinner. The adjoining beach is a nice additive to our vacation as well. Pool and jacuzzi was very enjoyable and we spent a lot of time there because it is very well made,positive
I stayed there for three nights. It was a great experience. Architectural design by welknown architect Geoffrey Bawa is awesome. The hospitality and quality food provided by Chef Mr Chandana Alwis was really memorable.,positive
"Really appreciate your service. Delicious food , friendly staff. We had excellent service throughout the stay. Variety of food corners specially including healthy food. Service was very quick. Once again big thanks for the heritance Staff. Thushara,Nipun,Rasika,chef rakita,chef Chandana,ex chef Chaluka",positive
"This hotel, fronting the beach on a large plot of land, is popular judging from the number of guests when I was there. Some guests had been there more than 20 times over the years. However, I was rather disappointed to see that the hotel is rather run down, unclean from the dust on the floor, some walls looked as if unpainted, the toiletries in the bath-room were just shampoo, bath gel and body lotion topped up in small ceramic bottles which I dislike as they don’t appear to me to be hygienic. Further more, there were in-room slipper and thus makes walking in the room on unpleasant when wet after a shower. I said earlier, this is not a resort. Apart from the pool and restaurant, there were no other fun activities within the hotel for guests. But despite all these, I rather enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere surrounding the place and the friendly services of all staff. Our 3 nights stay there was thus an enjoyable one. As for location, there is no decent shopping nearby.",neutral
"Booked this for my office staff trip. Place is absolutely beautiful with necessary amenities. Hotel is very old including most of its architecture. Beach access, facilities, Monster pool makes you to feel they are complete. Their dining area is so dark. I think that's one of those dining areas which can attract and impress many. It looks dull. Food variation was average. I was expecting Kandalama and Earls level of food variation which I didn't get. But I'm not worried about the food which was available too. Presented course was well balanced. Room interior is too old in my opinion. Staff was Okey! Had nothing to complain about. Time for an upgrade though. This hotel can easily become the best in Ahungalle",positive
"We really like this hotel and design and rukmal the room boy do his job verry verry well he design bath towels like animals , all staffs are verry verry good-tempered , place is quiet enough, heritance ahungalla is one of best resorts that i have ever go. Here i want thanks to staffs specially rukmall the room boy ...",positive
"Nothing to say much. Dont go their for offers. Locals are troublemakers for them. Only good thing is food (but limited spred ). Very compact rooms , bathrooms and even dining area. Unfriendly staff. Never expect this..",negative
"Very good hotel with very nice staff that make our room beautiful.very delicious food in buffet of dinner and breakfast.wonderful pool but ther beach is not very clean. Privet pool is very nice and quiet but the other pool is not,because of the seller.seller woman and man is around of the pool and try to speak to you.",positive
Great location and facilities. If you’re looking for a relaxing location where you can laze by the pool and hear the waves then this is a great spot . Wifi access is good . There are a few locals who try to spruik their goods which is a little annoying but they are outside the hotel rounds and are largely harmless. Tell them no thanks and they’ll leave you alone.,positive
It was a very warm welcome from the staff. And took so long time for checking process even though it was not a busy time. The room we received was not at the expected quality and filled with flyers. We had to request several times to remove flyers and finally we requested for new room since we were with an infant. Initially they rejected our request and I had to talk to FOM to get a new room. So until 6. 30 pm from the time we checked in (3.30pm). It was such a unpleasant experience. Other room services were all good. Restaurant services and foods was very good. Sleeping in the new room was a night Meare because of the noise came from ceiling. It seems that the room was just below a walking path or some steps. Infant was waking up most of the time because of this noise.,negative
"We visited the hotel immediately after Easter attach when everyone was scared to step into a hotel . The very first day it was only five rooms occupancy. With all these circumstances the limited hotel staff members looked afternoon us very well. They were ready to go to any length to serve the customer and make them happy. We enjoyed each and every moment of stay.Each meal was unique.All the facilities were excellent.😀 We commend the courage of the hotel staff to face the situation which was beyond their control. It’s so nice to use their Spa area , Balinese for a reasonable price. We recommend any person to visit Ahungalla Hesitance without any hesitation.",positive
We stayed for 4 days at Heritance Ahugalla in August 2019 and it was very good and enjoyable. staff were very friendly and helpful. highly recommended for families with kids. very close to beach and also they have a large and clean swimming pool. Rooms are modern and large. I want to specially thank the daily room service provided by Rukmal who prepared animal figures using the bath towels. the animal figures were fantastic and my children thoroughly enjoyed them.,positive
"We stayed here at the end of our trip to Sri Lanka for 4 nights to finish. The hotel is very clean and tidy, spacious rooms with nice views. Food and Drink was very good throughout the day (no alcohol served on religious holidays) Great pools, both in size and cleanliness Only thing that slightly let it down, staff need to do more to stop/move on Dogs, Cats and Water Monitors that walk I’m off the open beach",positive
"Spent a delightful weekend at Heritance Ahungalla during the last weekend of August to treat the two little birthday celebrants in the family. From the moment of check in it was nothing short of great!! Every meal was fantastic and the company of Duminda in the dining room was terrific!! They even got the kids a birthday cake during dinner!! (The bed was decorated with a birthday greeting!!) There was more than something for everyone in the vast buffet and the kids loved the variety! My husband and I are weight watchers and there was a Healthy Eats corner as well. In all honesty i gave this a miss as I wanted to spoil myself a little. 😁 the room was great and spacious though it was a triple! The two swimming pools were delightful and was great to spend hours!! The staff was always attentive, polite and efficient even when the hotel was running full!! By far one of our favorite beach hotels!!",positive
"One of the best hotels in down south sri Lanka...specially the staff is very friendly and helpful...also, we had a nice room on the 3rd floor with direct sea view...thank you for making our stay memorable and comfortable...",positive
"What an amazing towel artist Rukmal is. This is what we returned to after our river safari. Lovely hotel to stay in and great service. Beautiful pool and facilities, good food and lots of activities. Very enjoyable stay for families and couples alike.",positive
"Me and my family planned this small vacation to Heritance ahungalla because of a recommendation from a friend and after seeing the amazing photos that they have in their website. We stayed in two rooms and the rooms were pretty much normal. The view of the sea was covered from trees as it was in the 1st floor. And basic amenities were there. Nothing to get excited for. Food and the buffet was terrible. Only few options were there for vegetarians. They have not given their attention to minor things. For an example I had to request a different salt shakers during ALL the THREE meals I had during my stay. (One table didn’t have any salt/ pepper shakes, other two times - the salt was stuck in the shaker) . Also the arrangement of the buffet was hideous. Food were all over the place. The variety of food was really poor compared to the price we paid. The pool was amazing though!!! The view and the feeling was spot on ! And top notch!",negative
"We stayed at this hotel 2 nights, had breakfast there and it was ok. We are at sunshine restaurant just along the beach for lunch and dinner. Hotel was nice, room was big.. but the decor etc would of put as a 3 star. Staff were friendly, especially the security guards making sure we felt safe.",neutral
"We returned to this hotel after a few years, but yet again had a lovely time. This time I accompanied my old parents and Hotel took extra support on checking in, other facilities, etc..Thank you very much and we were very happy of it. The place is really beautiful overlooking the sea. Rooms are spacious and quiet. Excellent staff in the Hotel.. Many indoor and outdoor games. My son was able to bit of badminton as well. Two swimming pools. Indoor gardens with green surroundings. Food and staff service is great. Nothing to complain about all aspects of the hotel. Recommended and value for money.",positive
"Stayed at heritance Ahungalla which is a lovely hotel on the beach. Lovely food and Ruksan who looked after us and our room gave us a treat each day with his towel art.

"Lovely weekend getaway with wonderful stuff and service. We returned to this hotel after a few years, but yet again had a lovely time .. special thanks to Thushara who went out of his way to ensure we had a wonderful stay.

"When entering the hotel all the guests and bag are being checked by secirity personnels and metal detectors which is a good move to reassure safety. Valet parking is available. We were warmly welcomed and the reception was very busy atthe time we were checking-in. We were offered a welcome drink and a small snack as well as a refreshing face towel. The garden was neat and the lobby area was quite large and spacious. Furniture and the decor was modernised vintage looking. The room was looking so inviting and the lighting did its magic with the look of a lavishly renovated early bunglow. The bed was comfortable and so were the sheets and pillows. The view from our room was partially to the ocean and eventhough it was not directly centered at the ocean, the view of the sea from our room was spectacular. The food was on a buffet set-up and all of what I tried was delicious. Yet, I believe that the variety could have been improved, specially the breakfast service. On the other hand, the dinner was excellent! However, the lunch might not be the best buffets of Heritance Ahungalla I suppose. The buffet quality might be pressed down as a result of low rates being charged in this season to attarct more guests to the hotel. Moreover, the spa was relaxing and the therapists did their part well. Above all, the fragrance in the spa was fantastic. Unfortunately, we had a bad night. After having dinner, a function started at the hotel and we guessed that it was in the lobby area. It was extremely loud and we could not relax in the balcony or sleep inside. I am sure a manager or some authoritative personnel could have made a change in the location of the function. I understand that it was raining in the evening but the hotel might have a certain policy in terms of having functions at the hotel. There is ample space in the property and there might be a better place or a separate place to have functions. So, please make sure that such problems do not occur in the future. The aim of a hotel is to make all the guests delighted in their stay and not making ""some"" of the guests happy.",neutral
Excellent service location is excellent eye catching We love the food and the service of the staff is so good. The staff are very friendly and very helping . I felt it like a home thank u so much for the service given. We enjoyed a lot,positive
Excellent place to enjoy time with the family with an experienced and confident staff rendering a luxurious experience which make are valuable money and time worthy💯. The best place to be in Ahungalle without a doubt.,positive
"Heritance ahungalla is a really nice place to enjoy with your family. Great rooms, two pools and a nice view by the sea. We really enjoyed our stay also thanks to the large buffet with lots of choices. Special thanks to Chef Rakitha who made our stay even more likeable",positive
"Its been a few years since our family holidayed in Ahungalla and when considering an hotel to stay for our Anniversary, The hotel where we had spent 3 of our anniversaries was not far from our thoughts. When your wife says “Let’s go there, It feels like home” it so much easier, Done. Decision taken. And as always a good decision indeed. I called ahead and informed the hotel that we are celebrating our anniversary and they made sure we felt special. Thushara (Part of the management team) is the MAN. He is always on the ball, making sure everyone is taken care of, checking up on how the room is, if our lil son had any special dietary needs etc.. The room was specially decorated for us, our Dinner table was too. The cake and quartet who came along and made our special night even more memorable along with the management team was highly appreciated. Once again Thushara thank you for making it happen, Dinesh Thank you for making sure our glasses were never empty, for making sure our son too was well looked after and for doing a super job. Manoj, Nipun; you and your team are doing a great job of showing what Sri Lankan hospitality really is. Always with a smile, always looking to help and truly professional. As always, we will be coming back!",positive
"Heritance Ahungalla is located right next to the beautiful Ahungalla beach with lavishing views all around. It is a very safe and secure spot with efficient checking. We were warmly welcomed to the lobby by Sandali who offered us welcome drinks of different kinds and ensured we had a smooth check-in to the hotel rooms with our luggage sent to our rooms. We had a fresh fruit basket sent right after entering our rooms. The hotel has recreational activities available such as Table Tennis, Badminton, Table Football which are free of cost to play. There are also 2 very large and refreshing outdoor swimming pools available with a lifeguard always around providing you with assistance and towels. At the restaurant, buffet was available at all 3 meal times. The food was very appetizing with a variety of different kinds of food options available to pick from. The Restaurant manager Duminda Gunasinghe, is very friendly and hospitable to the guests and was elated to meet us. He managed everything professionally, making sure everything was properly arranged and up to the mark. We were also offered to have any dish of our choice made on special request by Duminda Gunasinghe. Nilanga was also very quick serving our table and always made sure empty plates were taken away and water was refilled in glasses. Malsh Rebecca was also very helpful in the restaurant, welcoming and arranging seats for new guests coming in for dining. Room maintenance was provided by Rukmal who kept the room hygienic and maintained it tidily by always replacing used towels and other essentials for the room. He is very talented and innovative, creating different types of structures using just towels making the guests feel welcomed. I would definitely visit this place once more and recommend it to anyone wanting to spend a vacation at a holiday destination.",positive
"We booked into the Ahungalla Heritance on the 14th of Aug 2019 for 5days and 4nights. It ws situated by the main road and was convenient to locate. We booked into the luxury suite which was room no. 101. The room was fabulous and was the definition of luxury: consisting of a private jacuzzi, two TVs, two separate bathrooms, a spacious sitting area with a comfortable sofa set plus all the other basic necessities(toiletries, grooming kits, iron box and table, slippers, clean towels, etc) and a separate bedroom with a comfortable bed. The best part being the view from the room. It opens to the outside to a neatly maintained lawn, a swimming pool and to the shore of the Indian Ocean which is accessible by a 5 min walk. Laundry service is quick and clean. A fully equipped air conditioned gym open till 10 pm is maintained on their 1st floor. The hotel has two large swimming pools, one at the entrance to the hotel with a poolside bar and restaurant. The main restaurant is only open for breakfast, lunch and dinner and usually serves food in buffet style. Food was delicious most of the time and had a wide variety of choices for all 3 meals. The hotel also has a billiard table, Foosball table, a carom board, 2 badminton courts, a ping pong table(table tennis) and a tennis court... Something that will help with boredom during the rainy times. The view during sunset was mesmerizing every time...makes you want to take a stroll by the seashore..The staff was outstanding with a service that was way above expectations...just to make their guests feel valuable and special...Our host was Mr Duminda Gunasingha ( Restaurant Manager) who is the most humble, friendly and helpful member of their staff...superb service throughout our stay... even went as far as to arrange dishes on our request.. especially for us on at least 3 occasions... Dilantha Rakitha, their sous chef, is the culinary mastermind behind the tasty dishes. Rukmal of room service is an artist who comes up with beautiful creations everyday to make us feel special. Then there was Nilanga who waited on us without a single flaw.. always with a charming smile...Nelka, the special tea expert... And Sweet Miss Sandali, would greet us everyday with a big smile on her face..... I personally did not have any complains during my stay... Would visit again soon and would recommend everyone I know to as well... Thank you... Will see you guys soon..",positive
Loved Heritance Ahungalla so much. Amazing hotel with incredibly helpful staff and delicious food. The rooms are lovely clean and gives you a homely vibe. Will definitely re-visit this place again soon... :),positive
WE had a nice time at heritance ahungalla.everything was really perfect.staff is very welcoming and friendly.we will come back next year too. THANK you fir everything... we wouldlike recommend to everyone.,positive
The service of all the staff was realy great and they all made me feel very welcome. In the restaurant the food was very delicious especially breakfast but most of all the excellent service given be all was an experience I will never forget. Only room and bed sheets cleaning are 10/6,positive
"We checked into the hotel on Sunday a day before a public and bank holiday after the security checking we seated in the lobby for nearly 1/2 hrs and there were no welcome drink no wet towers Following day we saw the cart is serving the guests. Hotel was very crowded and we feel that not enough staff members attend for guests .Huge crowd for lunch dinner and breakfast and we had to come late for all 3 meals . Food was good but less varieties. No entertainment only 2 pics band was playing in the lobby and that also stopped at 11 p.m. due to restrictions , We feel that hotel should give more priority to its in house guests . Rooms are good and clean. The pool was very nice and refreshing. This hotel can be maintained better compared to what we witnessed.",positive
"We stayed one night (full board) in a Premium room. The entrance to the hotel was impressive. We were very satisfied with the detailed security check that was done on arrival considering the prevailing situation in the country. The welcome was warm and friendly. Our room was comfortable. The restaurant was ok and food was good. The restaurant manager was very friendly. The hotel has two pools, thus making the pools less crowded at a given time, despite the number of guests. The beach was spectacular! It was a gloomy evening and we walked about 10 minutes to the North (as recommended by hotel staff) and came upon some cliffs that gave the most spectacular views of the ocean! Since we checked in on a week day, we were able to relax and spend a peaceful day. I heard it gets busier during weekends.",positive
"Ocean side room. Nothing was too much trouble from everyone at this Resort. Quick check in, we were part of a tour group, nine Australians, having an amazing time in Sri Lanka. Meals, rooms, and quality of linen, towels, we had our room attendant, such a really nice guy, Thank-you Rukmal for the best room service, plus that amazing bed decoration that you made, the best we have ever had made for us from all hotels in the world. Buffet dinners over the top, just so much to choose from. Thank-you all.",positive
Location can easily reach by highway from Colombo to Ahungalla 1 1/2 hours. Excellent Hospitality. implement security checking recently after 21st incident. Delicious food with much variety. enjoyed well. there are two pools. one is the resident pool. other one common. the rooms has not much clean . I asked broom sweep again. bad smell in room bathroom. Other than that it recommended to visit.,positive
"Amazing hotel, friendly, courteous and very hospitable staff. Food was excellent with a wide variety. Atmosphere and environment was both serene and entertaining at the same time. Highly recommended for a very good relaxing holiday with family and friends.",positive
"Yesterday (11th August 2019) had the chance to drop in at Heritance Ahungalla. To be honest the place was packed with locals and limited foreign travellers. Understandable due to recent incidents that happened in Sri Lanka. Wide area, Friendly Staff and a big swimming pool. The place can be maintained better compared to what i witnessed. One of the largest buffet with ample options for non-veg. ""Veggies"" I am sorry we have only limited option to go with. A decent place to spend time with your loved ones.",positive
"It is a beautiful beach property with well maintained and comfortable rooms, excellent location, warm hospitality and super delicious food. We had gone for a family holiday and we enjoyed every moment of our stay. I would like to give a special mention to Mr. Nipun from the Restaurant team who took special care on providing us vegetarian food and Chef Chandana who was very co-operative in taking our special requests for our choice of vegetarian food. Both of them we very welcoming and ensured that our experience at Heritance Ahungalla exceeded our expectations. One point which I was not very happy about was the quality of indoor games. The hotel should have a dedicated room of a section for indoor games were guests can spend leisure time with family. Apart from this the hotel has everything to make your stay memorable.",positive
i visit this hotel on 7th of august and this became my best vacation in a down south hotel.i were treated with amazing hospitlity.the staff is very kind & helpful always treated us with smile faces.the rooms are well aranged & tidy.i would like to thank chef Thilan for preparing delicious foods & beverages through out the stay.,positive
Had a wonderful stay at the hotel. Checked in 5th and checked out on 6th august.. Huge rooms with extra large TV.. felt that I have stepped in to a movie theater. Friendly staff with good attitude. Two large swimming pools accompanied with jacuzzis made our stay extra special. Never forget the tasty meals with variety of items at the buffet. Special Thanks goes out to chef Thilan who enlighten our tastebuds with his signature dishes. Over all memorable stay at the hotel and willing to go back again. Thanks.,positive
"Absolutely a fascinating and charming beach resort with excellent hospitality. Staff and the services from room to restaurant are beyond expectation. Food varieties are just right to cater to all tastebuds. Above all the welcoming and friendly services from check-in to check-out do compel everyone to be a repeater soon or later. Thank you Heritance Ahungalla for the superb holiday we spent to celebrate our Daughter's Birthday. Special thanks to Srinath, Lakshitha, Sunethra, Shanika and the front office staff, Rasika, Thushara, Nipun, Duminda and the F&B staff, Janaka and HK staff, Chaluka, Chandana and all the kitchen staff and last but not least Mr. Sisira Senaratne for the wonderful team that has been groomed for this lovely hotel! Good luck team Heritance Ahungalla !",positive
"i think this is the best place that people are having to have a grate holiday in down south at Sri Lanka due to my experiences.from time I step to the hotel and until I leave the place I was treated with best hospitalities with smile faces.the rooms we got are very comfortable and tide with well arrangements. It’s actually made our minds relax and calm than anywhere before we visited. Specially I should tell this, the hotel is blessed to have a such a talented chef called CHEF THILAN because we were treated with delicious foods and beverages all the time. Thank you chef Thilan and all of you for making our stay very happy.",positive
Heritance is an all time favourite hotel of ours and we have stayed over many times. This year our stay was made extra special with the excellent service from all staff. Staff were friendly and catered to special requests in every occasion. Special shout out to Dhuminda the restaurent manager who made us feel welcome and ensured we were well looked after. We were with a group of 6 children and his extra warmth and service made us feel very welcome. Thank you for the excellent service and no doubt we will be back again next year !!,positive
We stayed in a deluxe ocean view room for one night. The overall experience was great. Specially the food & services. All three meals had different options and the staff was very helpful & prompt. The pools over looking indian ocean are big and well maintained. This hotel quite old but they nicely renovated. The staff in all the departments were very supportive. The rooms are big & clean with all the necessary amenities. I can well recommend this hotel in any sort of a travel which you will experience a pleasant stay.,positive
Simply Excellent.From Rukmal in house keeping to Nelaka at dinning room service and the whole team fantastic service. We had very relaxing and enjoyable holiday. Thank you Heritance keep up the good work!,positive
"Hotel rooms are clean and Rukmal did a very good job with our room. Enjoyed his towel decorations. Difficult to book trips around here, and we didn’t like that hotel staff allowed local sales menn in the hotel area. We have been around Sri Lanka but never experienced such mess.",positive
"I was here for two week conference and found the hotel to be very beautiful with great staff. I must specially mentioned Duminda and Cassim from the F&B team who went out of their way to help me solve some issues I was having with my next destination. Laundry was also good and reasonably priced. This resort is a self containing resort, great for honeymooners but be prepared to spent a bit on transport if you want to see other sites and locations. there is not much to do around the hotel area and you will need a car to go to other tourist sites.",positive
This a very spacious hotel with ample area to walk and play. Has two lovely swimming pools and quick walk to the beach. The rooms were spacious and very comfortable . Has all amenties . The food was very good. Buffet has wide spread including ample seafood such as crabs and prawns. Very friendly for people with limited mobility Good service,positive
"We stayed 2 nights in a beautiful suite with partial sea views and nice breeze. The living room is nice with a TV to watch movies but because i am over 6 foot tall the couch is a little small for me. The bedroom was nice and i liked the TV in the room to watch movies and the movies channels were great along with the nature channels so was good to watch at night. Food on buffet was good and good choices especially the tom yum soup for dinner. I thought that being charged for bottled water in the buffet restaurant was a little ridiculous, but service was decent and one waiter took care of us for fresh juices at the cafe and at breakfast also. I really liked the sunday night band in the restaurant and kind of missed music the next night. Hot food selection was better on Monday than Sunday but overall the foods were good and we will come back. The adult side pool was beautiful and never crowded and the waiter there was awesome we ordered snacks to eat by the pool and he pulled a table over and made it really nice so i thank him for that on monday lunch. Was a good experience for us and having stayed with other hotels in the area we want to come back and possibly use the spa and Jacuzzi. We had a great time and urge others to come and enjoy here. The Saxaphone music on sunday night was incredible and even the band in the bard was nice monday night",positive
"Good reception at the gate by guards & the reception at main lobby.All are very friendly staff, varieties of delicious food, clean & tidy rooms, satisfactory security arrangements.Well maintain swimming pool",positive
Beautiful resort with open view on the ocean. The weather was perfect even though the monsoon period. I think we saw the rain twice notwithstanding the forecast was only showing the clouds. Friendly staff and comfortable rooms. Great food and good selection of wines. Lots of places to visit in Bentota. Highly recommended!,positive
"Had a stay for 4 nights with family and friends. We love the people working there. Good service, friendly smiles. Our party to celebrate 50+50 was perfect planned and nice, everyone enjoied. Thank you Ahungalla! We Will come back next Year! Regards from Pia and Patrik",positive
This is our 3rd visit to this beautiful place. Food and the service was excellent. We had a nice time here with the Family. Two swimming pools are great and definitely we will be back ............thank you.,positive

Highly recommended for your vacation!!! Best regards JG",positive
"A lovely short stay to spend my birthday getaway! I got upgraded into a Luxury room which I was very grateful! ❤️ From the time I arrived until I left, the staff were all warm and welcoming. Hotel facilities were great - massive pool and clean beach! My bed was so comfy. Heritance Ahungulla, a perfect place for holiday! It was so relaxing and peaceful. Thank you for a wonderful 3 nights, a vacation to remember! I am looking forward to my next visit... ❤️😊",positive
"It is very amazing place with most welcoming service, no words can specify this great full experience, the facilities and the staff are very friendly... The food was great All places are comfortable... Thanks Heritance Ahungalla",positive
"One of the best 5 star hotels in Sri Lanka with a friendly staff. The room was excellent. No words to express about the food as food was so tasty, great choice. All the staff are very friendly. Room service is also excellent. If you call in the midnight also they attend. Special thanks to FOM, Sunethra, Janaka Liyanage, Thushara, Rasika, Chef Thilan. Thank you Chef Thilan. The food is so tasty. Will be back again. I have visited Heritance Ahungalla so many times and every stay was excellent. Thank you Heritance Ahungalla staff and God bless you all. Dilani Cooray and family. 💕💕",positive
We had a great time at heritance ahungale. One of my favourite place I really love to spend my vacation. Food and the service was excellent. Also the staff is amazing here.they are very friendly and helpful... We will be back for sure..,positive
"We checked into the hotel the day before a public holiday. Following day while chatting to a waiter he said there is going to be a huge crowd for lunch hence come by 12:30. Apparently they were going to have about 350 day visitors when the restaurant can accommodate only 175. We had breakfast around 9:00, and no way we could eat again at 12:30. We had no choice but to cut short the holiday and go home. How can a hotel treat its in house guests like this? Instead they should have arranged lunch for day visitors in a separate hall. Everything else was ok.",negative
Heritance ahungalla is a beautiful hotel where you can relax and enjoy your holiday.. we had a great time during last weekend at heritance ahungalla.staff is very friendly and helpful.. food was amazing.we will come back again very soon.,positive
I really enjoyed the service and hospitality. Food was really awesome and enjoyable. A bit crowded these days and we know the reason for that. But really enjoyed the stay. Quality of the Pool was also good. Room arrangements and conditions were good and also clean and tidy.,positive
I would HIGHLY recommend this hotel.We stayed in a royal suite.It was so beautiful and very spacious.The staff was very courteous and professional. Food was good but less varieties. The pool was very nice and refreshing.Beach was amazing and clean.,positive
"We spend a weekend with our kids and what is most remarkable of this hotel is their friendly staff (although seems to be over worked), designed by Geoffery Bawa-the nature friendly surroundings are breathtaking. Beach is clean and well kept. The rooms are clean, comfortable and ours had sea view. They have 2 large pools, including seperate jacuzzi.Breakfast and dinner buffet had good variety and food was delicious. We were entertained by a magic show in the evening, and during dinner there was a small band with retro music, which was totally enjoyable.",positive
We were on our annual family trip on 15th June. We stayed one night with our families. My experience in suite was excellent with my family. We enjoyed our trip with kids a lot. Pools and beach is really good. Nice sceneries. Recommended. Thanks to the Management for support.,positive
"This is a lovely hotel located next to the beach with all the facilities needed.food is nice and the service is excellent.this was my 2nd visit to this hotel 8 years apart and the quality has not changed one bit.finally if you are planning to visit sri lanka please make note that this country is very safe, friendly and the tourism industry here is waiting to welcome you warmly.",positive
"Just concluded a relaxing holiday at Heritance, Ahungalla. The team led by their GM, Sisira Senaratne, went out of their way to make my family comfortable & happy. Especially, the Restaurant Manager, Duminda Gunasinghe with his team looked into all our needs on food & drinks & even made some ""specials"" which we liked. All this with smiles right round & friendly attitudes. We certainly will be back soon!! Roshan Gooneratne",positive
"Travelled with my wife for my Birthday weekend. Stayed one night in one of the luxurious suites. The number of tourists seemed to be a little low after the recent events however there were a few around as well as some locals. The standard of service was very high and very commendable. I was a little worried on whether buffet options would not be available, however to our delight both the Dinner and Breakfast were a lovely buffet with a wide variety of options. The room was quite large and very spacious, a living area as well as private balcony was available in addition to the large bedroom and spacious bathroom. We ordered in room service for lunch, a club sandwich and nasi goreng, both of which were very tasty and acceptable standard for the high price. We also ordered a delicious portion of cheese cake for tea which we thoroughly enjoyed. The swimming pool was very large and due to perhaps lesser occupancy we had a lot of privacy and were free to swim about. Given the standard of service and notable increase in tourists as well as locals travelling these days, booking early to secure a nice room with a view would be recommended. Definitely a lovely resort to visit, architecture is a key facture in the property and there is a lot to be appreciated in the overall design and fell of the location. A lovely option to consider if visiting the Ahungalla towards Galle area. A convenient drive on the souther expressway from Colombo and not far off from the highway exit. Great stay!",positive
"I would be failing in my duty if I don't place on record the excellent service provided by the hotel staff at Heritance, Ahungalle during our stay from the 14th to the 16th of June 2019. My father, the Late Mr. Walter Wimalachandra who was on the Board of Directors of Aitken Spence until his demise in early 1990, was very closely associated with the hotel, then known as Triton from its inception, even from the time the land was selected to build the hotel. Therefore it is no wonder that I have such fond memories of holidays spent at Triton as a child, with my family. In fact I have had the good fortune of spending our Honeymoon, our 10th Wedding Anniversary and our 30th Wedding Anniversary on the 27th October 2016 at this hotel. Every time I have visited the hotel, the hotel staff have lived upto the high standards my Late father would have been proud of. It is no wonder that this is my favourite choice when it comes to selecting a venue for much needed rest and recreation. This time too the the service provided by the staff was such that we will always want to return soon. The room reservations, both by Supun at the Head Office and the Front Office staff at the hotel, was carried out very smoothly and satisfactorily. We were provided with very good rooms by the Resident Pool , as requested by us. The Guest Relations officer, Ms.Shanika Jayasekera was very obliging and together with the Executive Chef Mr. Chaluka Rodrigo, organised a birthday cake etc.tocelebrate my husband's birthday. From the executive staff to the room boys and waiters/waitresses, every one was so cheerfuland courteous seeing to our every request. However I would like to specially mention, Mr. Rasika Ratnayake, the F & B Manager, Mr. Thushara Gunaratne, the R & B Manager, Mr. Duminda Gunasinghe, the Restaurant Manager, Mr. Chaluka Rodrigo, the Executive Chef, Mr. Dilantha Rakitha, the Pastry Chef, Ms.Shanika Jayasekara, the Guest Relations Officer, Tharindi de Silva and Trilicia Thomson, members of the Front Office staff. Being a shareholder of the Company under which this hotel is run, it is heartening to know that the staff at Heritance, Ahungalle go far above and beyond their call of duty to satisfy their guests. Well done and Congratulations.",positive
"We visited to celebrate our anniversary. Even though its quite apparent that we are a couple, a twin room was provided. In the reservation page its mentioned about a sea view room (""best perhaps are the private balconies – from where it will seem as if the sunsets are ablaze in glory, just for you""). The photo also showing a sea view room. But we were given a garden view room in an isolated corner. When inquired the answer was ""sorry sir we are full today"". Its not an excuse. I must mention that we were not late for our check in . Actually we came around 12.30pm because we planned to have the lunch as well . Then moving to the condition of the room itself, It's very old looking small one. The doors were rusted, stained & discolored. The Bathroom is small, ancient & basic. Walls faded & definitely need painting & renovation. Even most of the 2-3 star level hotels provided a much superior rooms than this. Neither Toothpaste, toothbrush nor shaving items provided which are expected to be provided in a 5 star hotel. We had to asked for it. When asked they have provided us with two packs of toothbrushes & only one of them had a tiny toothpaste for us two. Anyway we manged it economically for two days although both of us used to brush teeth after each & every meal. We didn't bring those because all the other five star hotels we have visited have provided them without any fuss & we honestly expected this hotel to be the same standard level. I noticed the lack of the shaving kit only in the next day morning. I knew i had to ask for it again. But as we are checking out anyway i didn't bother the housekeeping staff early in the morning and left my self unsaved for the breakfast. I'm wondering whether they are providing older rooms especailly for the discounted booking offers. We reserved Heritance Ahungalla thinking that they would provide with the same exceptional service like their Heritance Kandalama which we visited sometime back. Anyway we have determined to avoid Heritance hotels here after as its not worthy taking any risk ,after our anniversary got totally ruined. I truly hope you could make some improvements in the future.",negative
"We could not ask for a better choice than deciding to spend one night out with family at Hotel Herittance. The experience was awesome making our stay a memorable one with the executive staff and the minor staff going out of the way to make sure that we got everything we wanted to make it a special weekend for all of us. The Chef Chaluka went out of the way to make it very special for the 7 vegetarians in our group to compensate with other special dishes on the b-b-q night which was much appreciated by them. A surprise cake was requested to celebrate a nephews birthday and Thushara the Rest. & Bar Manager and Duminda the Rest. Manager along with other staff made it very special than was anticipated which made it a nice tea party to start off our week end with. We all had great fun with dancing, enjoying the lovely two pools and the variety of food offered in all their buffet meals that was not only tasty but were in abundance. All in all we all left very happy having enjoyed to the brim with our family. Special mention must be made about the friendly staff serving in every area who are always with a broad smile which is a pleasant sight to the guests and good reflection to the Hotel! I will not think twice to go there again! The ocean view from every angle in the Hotel is breath taking and the drive through from the entrance to the hotel is very environmentally friendly!",positive
"very nicely laid out hotel. great staff and facilities are incredible. Two large pools, beach and spa's. A gym, library and plenty of parkland. The food is great and plenty of variety in food. Rooms are very well apponited and plenty of parking.",positive
"We have just finished a 3 night stay at this 5 star resort, as a wind down at the end of our 14 day JourneyScapes tour. The hotel is on the beach but unless you are a strong swimmer I suggest you stick to the pools! Beautiful at sunset but expect to be harassed by the lovely ladies selling sarongs! This resort was designed by famous architect, Geoffrey Bawa, is is cleverly constructed with nature and building blending perfectly together, as is the case in Bawa’s beautiful Lunuganga estate nearby. Don’t miss the old Triton builders’ lift he designed, now displayed in the foyer! The hotel is not new and could do with some renovation in the future, but it offers everything a 5 star resort should, from two large and immaculately clean pools and well tended grounds to excellent service from all staff. Our room attendant, Suranjith, was especially kind and helpful, always with a smile on his face. He even went out of his way to find out the brand of the lovely bath products in our room. Food in the main restaurant was buffet style, except for the last evening, when most guests had departed. This menu is extensive, well prepared and delicious! There is an emphasis on amazing Sri Lankan food, but there are sufficient choices to suit even the fussiest diner. We particularly liked the delicious a la carte meal on the last night. There is also a cafe and a Seafood Restaurant. The friendly, informative head chef, Chaluka, told us that where possible the food is sourced locally. So fresh! We were at the hotel over a weekend and Saturday was very busy, with lots of people coming for the night. Could be very crowded in peak season. However the staff managed the large numbers very professionally. On Sunday we had the pool to ourselves once again! Our room overlooked one of the pools and was well appointed, with comfortable beds and a large bathroom. Suitable towel rails are lacking however, with the main one over the toilet. However you can ask for new towels whenever you need them. Suranjith decorated our beds every morning with fresh flowers. A lovely touch! Overall an amazing stay, and a great finish to our holiday!",positive
What lovely people the Sri Lankan people are. And the stuff here were continually ensuring that we enjoyed our stay. knowing that i was ill before arriving they continually made certain i was getting better. I would particularly like to thank Duminda from the restaurant. every time we saw Duminda he would smile and ask how we were and what we had done that day or what we were doing for the day. Nothing was ever a problem and every request was met with a smile. Duminda is certainly an asset to Heritance Ahungalla. we will certainly be returning Thank you Duminda. Thank you Heritance Ahungalla,positive
"A memorable stay at Heritance from 30th May to 1st June 2019. Stayed here with family, A special mention of Duminda Gunasinghe @ the main restaurant, who made our stay memorable with his outstanding friendly and professional service. We will definitely be back.",positive
"We stayed for week and we really enjoyed our stay. Our comments are: What we liked: - Rooms are clean and they pay attention to details. Putting flowers on a daily basis - Our cleaner (cannot remember his name) was very attentive and polite and great - Breakfast options are many and great - Great food in general and much cheaper than all the restaurants around the area - there is a great choice and the food quality is very good - Resort offers daily activities (simple ones) but they are nice to take part in - The resort staff is providing the comfort that they are taking good care of you. They come in to spray the room and get it ready for the night so that you do not have to - returning clients for many years show that the hotel is taking good care of their customer What we did not like: - we arrived late at night and really tired - we would expect to have the check in process easy and smooth but took a long time, and the receptionist did not even know that our reservation included breakfast etc. really not something that we were looking for - services are super expensive from taxis to the airport etc. Get an uber not a tuk tuk that are trying to reap you off, too - the moment you step at the beach people are trying to sell things constantly - the beach and the sea were rough - seriously if you are not surfing there is no way you can properly swim (which is a shame but nothing can be done about it). - tuk tuk mafia in the area - very expensive, depending on European visitors to ask for crazy prices. They follow you in the shops making deals for themselves with the owners by bullying them. If you want to buy souvenirs visit the government shops in Colombo and the airport.",positive
"Our home away from home! Our first visit was in 2007 and we have come almost every year since then. Each stay was more memorable then others. Always receive a warm greeting at arrival, mouth watering food, fantastic rooms, beautiful garden, excellent service delivery. We benchmark other hotels to Heritance. Keep up the good work!",positive
"Got upgraded to luxury/deluxe rooms upon checkin.. These rooms have pool/beach facing view.. Lots to do and explore in the property. Beach access from the property. Beach is nice, clean and not at all rocky. Very safe Two swimming pools, sports facilities (table tennis, tennis, badminton) Buffet was good (though does get repetitive). If trying ala carte, try the Sri Lankan rice and curry..",positive
"Excellent stay,3 nights beach break part of tour. Our room on 3rd floor overlooking pool & beach. Very good wi fi, comfortable bed, hot shower , quiet aircon. A lot of food options, good service, would highly recommend this hotel to tourists. Thank you for a lovely stay",positive
"I stayed Heritance Ahungalla on last weekend and had great fun! The staff members were friendly and the food was great and had a variety for dinner buffet! But their staff service is bit slow compared to other place may be due to rush on last Sunday. The place was crowded, but had enough space for everyone to enjoy. But the rooms were again small, and old. Well there was an incident where we checked out, we have been informed that we used the minibar (which we didn't use at all and it was locked entire our stay) and after we explained the situation, they agreed on it as their mistake and didn't charge any extra amount which was so grateful. Overall, I would recommend this place for relaxing holiday with family! Tip: The same incident happened for us in different hotels, so soon after you checked into the hotel room, make sure to check the minibar unless you do not plan to use it to avoid the hassles!!!",positive
Visited the property when it was not very crowded. They were not in their best after the security situations in the country. Hence they did not have a good spread of food for buffet. But they did their best to provide with lovely lovely food for the few customers there. There is definitely room to improve in the food section and the cocktails in the pool bar. Other than that the hotel has a lovely ambience. It has two beautiful pools and the staff members are really friendly and helpful.,positive
"We checked in to the room not knowing they have given us a twin room. What made us upset was the girl who escorted us to the room Dinushi, the excuse she gave was ""if you checked in early we would have given you a better room"" I was stunned! I immediately told them that we will be checking out the next morning even though we were booked for two nights. It was around 6pm when we checked in and we were too tired after traveling from colombo otherwise I would have definitely checked out the same night. Room was so small and very dirty and old. Bathroom was very small and mind you a huge cockroach was running over our bathroom amenities imagine using rhose tooth brushes and soap and those refill type shampoo bottles which were anyway spilt. I was so upset I cabt tell you how much because we were there to celebrate a birthday. It was all ruined. Later on the duty manager came and ask whether we would do a room change and said the hotel was full but we didnt want to trouble the house keeping staff as we were anyway going to check out next morning. Food at the restaurant was ok but not the best of heritance maybe the reason why was because all the guests were locals. Restaurant staff was good. Friendly. Next morning when we came down to the lobby to check out, i cant believe the same girl Dinushi's attitude towards us. Even though I looked at her she made sure to frown at me. Not bothered to atleast talk to us nor apologize. Wow I am from the same industry and I cant imagine the way she acted. Sadned by the fact that we are from the same industry yet we've been disrespected this way. I am disheartened to write all this because as hotelliers we all have so much expectations from Heritance hotels.",negative
"We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. superb service and best food. We all loved the variety of food they had.especially a big thank you to Thushara the banquet manager and the team, they looked after us very well. They are so friendly and helpful. Very good hospitality we will definitely go back to this hotel.",positive
Ever so friendly and helpful staff members. Especially manager Thushara and Duminda went out of their ways to make our holiday memorable. Tasty food and good rooms. Two pools were amazing. The highlight was the staff. Best staff ive come across after Uga Jungle beach.,positive
"It was a fantastic holiday spent with most friendliest hospitality gesture by the staff of Heritance Ahungalla. If you make visit to this most spectacular masterpiece, guaranteed your second visit. Mouth watering cuisine of Heritance Ahungalla will assure your decision of coming back. Come and experience the true feeling of luxurious hospitality home away your home.",positive
As the heading the meals were above five star and the variety was excellent. We reserved a Suite thinking that there will be a DVD Player which is very comman nowadays. But it was not available. Suites were samll compared with suites in most of the other five or four star hotels in Srilanka. Our overall experience was quite pleasant as the staff was very friendly.,neutral
"I just got back from Sri Lanka after spending 5 memorable days there. We spent the first four days in the picturesque beach of Ahungalla in Heritance Resort. From the minute I walked into the airy white-pillared lobby, I knew it was going to be a vacation like no other. The staff greeted us with local refreshment and iced tea. The infinity pool stretching to the turquoise ocean left me awestruck for a while. We were taken to an exquisite suite through the lobby which had a distinct Victorian style of architecture with monochromatic chequered floors, tree-lined open courtyards in between stairways. All I could hear while I walked was the chirping of birds, the kind I haven’t heard in cities. The other sound was that of the roaring sea, its waves crashing on the shores. Heritance Ahungalla is a one of its kind of beach resort, designed by Geoffrey Bawa, a reputed British architect who lived in Sri Lanka and has also designed the Sri Lankan Parliament House. The suite is embellished with ornamental wooden furniture, luxurious lounge chairs, armchairs, Jacuzzi and even a curated library. A few minutes later I explored there was a radio playing in all rooms, happy songs of the good old 90’s I can’t get enough of! That is the little part of Sri Lankan morning I brought back with me, FM Gold app on my phone and Dimbula fragrant tea. I am in love with the local cuisine and chose to have Sri Lankan food for all my meals during the stay. It is truly a seafood lovers’ haven with the fresh catch of crabs, fish, prawns and lobsters cooked with locals spices and a lot of love by the seasoned cooks of the island. Every meal was a delight and the fresh weather ensured my metabolism was higher than usual. Evenings were mostly spent in the sea beach and the infinity pool, where the blues merged, the moon and stars saw their reflections in the tranquil water and they shined even brighter. The hospitality of the staff was beyond my expectation. People are kind, helpful and smiling. Sri Lanka, and particularly the place we stayed is really a place with a soul. Above all, I would really like to mention that the security facilities in the resort and across the tourist destinations in the country are top notch. After the Easter bombing incident, there is army posted everywhere and security protocols are being followed to ensure we are safe in their country. ISIS attacks are happening everywhere in the world - France, Spain, and even the US. But travel advisories were not issued against them. The island country of Sri Lanka lives only on tourism. The dip in tourist flow is wiping away livelihood of millions. While I write this, I have a cup of piping hot Ceylon tea on my table, a phone full of amazing pictures and a mind full of beautiful memories. Sri Lanka, you beautiful country! Love and prayers.",positive
We stayed here 2 nights on HB meal plan and the team at the all day dining Restaurant has been fabulous. Our special thanks goes to Duminda(Restaurant Manager ) who was extremely caring and helpful. We will certainly be back in the amazing place sooner than later 😘😘,positive
Same as kandalama heritance also have poor hospitality. They don't care about customers. They act like we came to stay and eat there for free. 😂. After having bad experience in kandalama the I went heritance ahungalla. No difference. So after the bad experience from both heritance hotel I stopped choosing heritance hotel.,negative
"The best place to go and spend your vacation.You can enjoy the luxury of the hotel while being treated so kindly by the hotel staff.The rooms are in their best quality.You really can enjoy the evening by having a cup of tea viewing the Indian ocean.The food is awesome and the pools, there's nothing to say about it.",positive
"We patronize the Heritance Ahungalle simply because it offers exceptional hospitality. Every request is accommodated and you will never hear a staff member decline a request, without evaluating all possibilities. That’s really difficult to find these days and that “extra” effort is the difference between extraordinary and ordinary. Special thanks to Chef Thilan, Rasika and Nipun and the restaurant for their amazing hospitality, and I must state that the cuisine has certainly upped its game and was absolutely amazing over the few days we were there. The lobster bisque and the Lamb broth need special mention for it’s lovely texture. I wish to also thank Rukmal from housekeeping who always attended/arranged our room the moment we set out. He would always leave a memento of some sort, which actually made us look forward to entering the room. Very nice touch. Everyone on the staff at every level was friendly and helpful, and complimented the beautiful atmosphere of the hotel. Nothing pretentious, just genuine Sri Lankan hospitality.",positive
"Heritance Ahungalla is one of the world class hotels,that one could ever dream of spending a vacation.It’s dreamy atmosphere with a magnificent view of the pool and the beach takes our breath away.As usual we were offered great hospitality,and made our stay extra special.Thanks to all the staff,specially mr Thushara,Nipun,and ms Trilishia and Dinusha for the assistance offered,for our emergency.We will surely visit this paradise again.Thank you,and wish the Heritance team success in their every effort.",positive
"Pros- Relaxed beach location with spacious rooms. Good choice of bars and restaurants. Excellent breakfast buffet. Friendly staff, especially in the restaurants and around the pool. Very nice, big pools. Lots of interesting wildlife. Laundry service was excellent and good value. Cons- There were some hawkers on the property around the pool area selling sarongs and tours. An annoyance when trying to relax. The air con in our room was not very effective. By contrast it was excellent in our kids room. There was black mold in the shower. When it rains, the communal corridors are prone to flooding. The room attendants are very pushy about tips. Our attendant Ranil visited our room a day before we left to tell us he wouldn’t be there the following day. We tipped him well, but the next day, the day of our checkout, a new room attendant who we didn’t know came into the room twice on the pretext of checking the minibar and hung around clearly also expecting to be tipped. We are always happy to tip for service, but this pushy experience made us quite uncomfortable and left a bad final impression of our stay. The day before leaving we asked for a late checkout on one of our two rooms and were told that would be possible for an extra $50 US. We happily agreed to this, but the following morning we were told neither room was available. This seems unlikely as the hotel was not at all busy (it was five days after the terrorist attacks). So we had a few hours hanging around the hot hotel common areas before our airport pickup. Not the best way to end what was otherwise a very enjoyable and relaxed stay.",neutral
"The housekeeper Rukmal kept our room spotless, each day we returned to find flowers and an amazing animal displayed on our bed that he had created from a towel. This man has serious talent - he should be in reception teaching guests his art. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. Thanks for such an amazing time.",positive
A truely remarkable place designed by late Jeffery Bawa. With a close view of the sea.i stayed one night with my wife and son and had a marvellous time. The staff was really helpful and available. Food was excellent.,positive
"The rooms had tons of storage space.. All main amenities included Two lovely pools. The second pool which is on the right side of the property, has a beautiful tree that leans over part of it, creating some natural shade on hot days. Food was great as always.",positive
"This hotel is right on the beach with wonderful views. An interesting turtle hatchery just up the road with a few local shops just outside the hotel gate. I had a good massage at a house just next to the hotel gates down a long drive. The father did the massage and I met the mother and 3 kids which was a great experience. The food selection at the buffet was excellent and of very good quality including many western style food choices. The room was good but a little tired in places. Overall, an enjoyable stay.",positive
"For the travellers looking for a true Sri Lankan experience with elegance and world class service, Heritance Ahungalla is among the best in the Island. Front desk staff will make you feel special at check in and check out, by attending to every little requirement you have as guests, and try to do their best to accommodate whatever they can, walking the extra mile. In our case, it was Chathura who made our encounter at the entrance special. Hotel Management and the Staff at the main restaurant and the pool bar were so friendly and helpful at every time. This was a visit we made after a decade and the positive difference we saw is highly commendable. Thank you again, GM Sisira Senarathna, Chef Thilak, staff at the restaurants including Thushara, Dumindu and Nipuna House keeping and maintenance staff, and many others I didn't mention here by their names, for looking after us, and our parents who needed additional support and attention, with love and care in a way we have never expected. Hotel is great for both foreign and local travelers. Breathtaking ocean front, well maintained clean rooms and other five star++ facilities, authentic Sri Lankan food, and excellent service with true Sri Lankan hospitality will make anyone's stay perfect at the Heritance Ahungalla.",positive
Beautiful surroundings 2 pools great gardens sandy beach. Meals were lovely and the bar was very pleasant. great place to relax. Our room 128 opened onto the pool area and it was very pleasant to sit outside. The room was clean and had all that we required,positive
"We decided to visit Sri Lanka as 3 couples me and my wife, sister, brother, sister in-law and brother in-law. We booked our trip through Tui and decided to book the Heritance Ahungalla as our accommodation. The only problem was that my brother and sister in-law did not book until a week later and did not manage to book this hotel as it became fully booked so they booked into the sister hotel next door which was the Rio which was partly owned by Tui. Firstly I want to make a comparison between these two hotels the Heritance is more a Sri Lankan style hotel and the Rio is very modern. The rooms in the Heritance are big and comfortable but could do with some updating. It has 2 swimming pools which are very warm. There is main restaurant were everbody eats is ok but can get busy and you may sit outside if you wish you can also eat at 2 additional restaurants at a price if you are all inclusive like us you can get a 50% discount. You have to be aware that even if you are all inclusive not all drinks are free, usually locally produced drinks are but not here. If you eat in the main restaurant and have drinks its all inclusive soft drinks, beer and wine. If you go out to the bar to watch the entertainment and ask for wine you have to pay not only that but even for a cappuccino, even locally produced alcohol. This is not all inclusive! Be aware the staff at the hotel don't speak very good English not like in the Rio. We found that we had to keep asking the waiters and waitresses continually in the restaurant to get a drink as they kept forgetting, but outside in the bar they were pretty quick to serve you drinks. I found this to be penny pinching not like in the Rio as the staff would serve you quickly and what ever you wanted at not extra charge as we found out due to my sister in-law paying for us to have all day access to the hotel for her Birthday. I would say that its up to the individual on what hotel is better suited for your needs. Positive if you want peace and quite pick the Heritance if you want modern with everthing included in the all inclusive price pick the Rio your choice. Tipping staff is helpfull to get what you want.",positive
"Although not near the town centre, this hotel is sited on a beautiful beach, with two pools it has something for everyone. Totally rebuilt after the Tsunami. Breakfast buffet was huge, covering all tastes. Vanilla yoghurt smoothie was delicious. Food in the cafe was very reasonably priced and delicious. Forget the taco in the bar, disappointing. Large comfortable bedrooms, air con bit noisy though. Staff delightful and helpful.",positive
"Stayed in room 249 - the upkeep of the room was excellent, all staff bent over backwards to accommodate any requirements, the service was always friendly and made our stay very special. Anyone who complains about this hotel is a professional moaner, so please disregard any negative comments you may see. We will definitely return to this hotel and will recommend it to friends and family. Trips that we would highly recommend include Galle, Kandy and Whale watching - check with reception re their deals for these trips before booking elsewhere. One of the best aspects of this hotel is its stunning location.",positive
Good - It has beach and a relatively big swimming pool which is clean and nice. Beach has nice veiw but little wavy. Bad - Lower staffs are not friendly... Foods are clean and tasty but not cheap. Tea was very bad....,neutral
"This hotel is absolutely beautiful. The rooms are fantastic, the staff are so friendly and welcoming, the pool is divine and it backs on to a beautiful beach, that is near enough empty. Breakfast plentiful, dinner buffet also good. Reasonably priced (mid-range) but feels like you should have paid a lot more. Would definitely recommend!",positive
"We stayed 3 nights as part of a 14 day trip. Great rooms, perfect location and spot on service. The idealistic location is hard to go by and we enjoyed the fact that when swimming in the pool you could get a bed in the shade no matter how many people where around. I am sure if you looked there are things that could be improved but for us it was hard to fault.",positive
"This is a beautiful well-maintained hotel. Apart from our room key not working three times the food and beautiful surroundings on the spectacular beach are hard to beat! The only problem is that selfish European tourists ""capture"" their deck chair seats all day starting at 0700 am! this means that when they are in their room or not using them no one else seems to be able to use them! the hotel should definitely stop this and pass a policy to only allow guests who are using the pools to use the chairs and otherwise give them up immediately to be democratic to others. For this reason alone we give the hotel only 3 stars.",neutral
"Heritance Ahungalla is my second home. Love the view and the amazing breeze that I feel when I stepped in to the lobby. Food is always yummy and I like that taste. Excellent service from all the staff, specially the front desk & housekeeping. I will recommend this hotel to everyone.",positive
Showing its age a bit but a well appointed room this is a hotel great for chilling and catching up on the suntan the staff are friendly and always willing to help the breakfast and evening meals are of excellent standard and always piping hot and a very exspansive and varied menu fantastic beach location we enjoyed our stay but very busy at times as it is a large hotel,positive
"Stayed over new year with the in-laws - one suite and one deluxe room. The property is showing it’s age with the rooms and public areas ready for some investment and TLC, however it was part of the charm but it may not be to expectations if looking for 5 stars. Some of the staff were excellent and the location is on a nice stretch of beach although the undertow in the water can be a challenge. Breakfast is a wide spread which was nice, and the beach shack had some excellent seafood bbq whilst listening to some old school raggae. Ultimately there are better hotels and needs a bit of work to it.",positive
"This is my 29th visit to this Lovely place.., the staff is amazing and very helpful. food and the service also excellent.. I am so happy to stay here. That is why I am keep coming in every year. my room is excellent with a big balcony. I would like to recommond this lovely place to anyone who wants to have a relaxing holiday.",positive
"It was not the greatest hotel we stayed at but it had a good service, nice beach, ok food and all you could expect from a resort like that. We had an upgrade which was appreciated. The property should definitely be refurbished though because it is old and a bit run down. All in all we had a good service but expected a more classy place.",neutral
"We were underwhelmed on arrival here, with drab buildings and long institutional corridors, but the pools are fab, especially the smaller one, and the gardens and beach large and peaceful. The evening buffet offer is expensive so we stuck to the a la carte restaurant, which was fine.",positive
"Heritance Ahungalla is a very nice 5 star Sri Lanken hotel. The reception when we arrived was really good and we had a nice big room that was very quiet. The rooms are cleaned at least once a day. Some parts of the hotel need to be renovated but overall it is a high standard hotel. The breakfast was good and there was plenty to choose from. In the morning we sat outside when we could find a table as inside was cold. Most of the time the evening buffet was outside when wetter permitting. The à la carte and fish restaurant are very good. In the garden we had plenty of space and there are a lot of sun beds. The beach is just wonderful, very clean and wide. The waves are most of the time strong but fun. There are some restaurants on the beach nearby if you want to eat something different.",positive
"An awesome hotel right on the beach and swimming pool overlooking the sea. Spacious and comfortable room but looks a little dated, sumptuous buffet spread for breakfast and dinner and the staff who are pleasant and friendly make it a great place to spend time. Thank u Heritance Ahungalla for a memorable stay.",positive
"I had a twin room which was very good but maybe would be a bit on the small size for two people. The bed was very comfortable, there was a desk with a reading lamp in the corner. The bathroom was small but fine for just me. There is a big pool very close to, and overlooking the beach and sea. The sea has too many waves to swim in but good for splashing around and having a bit of fun in. There is not much outside the property but there is a jewellery shop across the road with a very helpful and genuine owner and a wine shop to the right who will rip you off with ""tourist prices"". To get further afield the hotel does offer taxis but they are expensive. I enquired about Bentota and it was $23 return, another couple got a Tuk Tuk and ""negotiated"" the price down to 700 SLR abut £3.50. Obviously the car is more comfortable, your choice. The food and the staff are very good. If you want to eat elsewhere there are a couple of places on the beach on right of the property.",neutral
Good place to have a day out and they have events for groups.Food tastes good.9ft depend pool is attractiveService also very good.They will take care with your requirements.Recommending this hotel....,positive
"From the moment you arrive till the time you leave this fabulous hotel with its attentive, friendly and engaging staff never fails to impress. Our large airy room overlooked the main pool and beach and when not walking the golden sands or wallowing in the pool or relaxing in the shade of the trees around the second pool there was nothing better than sitting on the balcony enjoying a drink and listening to the nightly music from below. The breakfast buffet was huge. Well laid out and fresh daily. The food in the restaurants was well presented and tasty. My favorite, the Mexican with Sri Lankan influence menu. Ate there twice, different courses both times, everyone of them delicious. Would I return. In a heartbeat.",positive

"An awful lot of the people complaining about this hotel are moaning that it 'isn't five star'. As I recall, until fairly recently, a hotel in the UK had to have a Corby Trouser Press in the room to gain that vital fifth star. So maybe people are taking their view of '5 star' from the UK and, if they are then they are probably right - it isn't UK 5 star. But if it was you'd be paying a hell of a lot more than £150/night for it. It is, by any measure a stunning hotel. Cleverly designed by Geoffrey Bawa this low rise hotel (ground floor and two floors above) is laid out to create a series of separate spaces that never seem crowded (they only have just over 100 rooms). The setting, right on the beach, is terrific and the two giant pools are a delight. Those people giving it a poor review also complain that it is 'tired'. It would hardly be surprising given the fight against the elements that must be waged to maintain it but I can't agree. The grounds are imaculate and, yes some of the corridors are showing their age but the spacious rooms are absolutely fine. I've also found the staff to be gracious, charming and attentive. Most Sri Lankans are but here they definitely go the extra kilometre. And you can't fault the food, especially the buffet breakfast which will set you up for the entire day. The buffet supper is also excellent with a cornucopia of choice and a good selection of wines. Don't believe the nay sayers, there's nothing wrong with this hotel.",negative
"Room, location and cleanliness were just perfect. The only slightly thing they can work on is the refurbishment of the building that is starting to give sign of the age. In any case it's really worth the experience. The beach is highly recommended.",positive
"Nothing five star about this hotel. That doesn’t mean it’s terrible, it just doesn’t do what it says on the tin. We should’ve realised when we saw the deal we got. However, blissfully unaware we departed for what was meant to be a 5* hotel in Sri Lanka. From the start things went wrong. I didn’t understand how a hotel with 5* reviews on Tripadvisor could be so different to reality. But, what they do is they hand out cards asking you to rate them 5*, i presume most oblige as if you don’t they repeatedly ask you and get a “bit” irritated if you don’t. Unpleasant and unnecessary and not something you would ever experience in a 5* resort. Room: Our first room smelled like an ash tray, for two non smokers this was just an immediate no. After we said we wanted a new room they looked frustrated, but acknowledge the smell. Seemingly they wanted us to just ‘get on with it’. I don’t know if a 5* hotel which permits smoking indoors, especially with private terraces available. Finally we moved rooms (having to unpack / repack). Our second room had a broken AC, which in 32 degree heat was also unacceptable. After two nights of no sleep, 5 complaints about the AC and being told “it’s fine”, we finally moved to a third room. The AC worked and the room was much larger, an upgrade we thought. However, after the first night it was all clear. We were next to the maintenance and cleaning room, so at about 6.30-7am every morning we were woken up by the sound of trolly wheels on the stone floor. It is so loud that you don’t stand a chance of sleeping through. Initially they don’t turn down the bed and don’t give you the water they promise. The upside of the rooms are the large and comfy beds, and our room housekeeper (Rukhal) was good and left funny towel shapes (monkeys, dogs etc). Poolside: the pools are great, we spent most of our days by the green pool. Lots of space and a nice atmosphere. However, they don’t clear up so following morning you will find yesterdays banana skins, glasses etc. Quite disgusting. We ended up clearing up ourselves. Staff: some great members of staff, highlight was definitely Waruna. Seemingly the only trained and wanting to please member of staff. The rest don’t want to be there and expect to be greated with eye rolls and attitude even when ordering food. You feel like you’ve inconvenienced them at great length. Try ordering a cappuccino at breakfast and you’ll know what I mean. Especially when you get a cold one and ask for a hot one. Three people will try to tell you to drink it and then dip a finger in when you say it’s cold. Going the extra mile certainly doesn’t come naturally. Another upside was when the guest relations manager walked around asking for feedback. We shared our experience and things improved, that evening our bed was turned down, more water was given and pool was improved. It lasted merely one day though. Also, one member of staff in the restaurant wears an unsightly net vest! I think he is trying to be funny. Seems unhygienic and out of place. The hotel is filled with staff but they are untrained and only do one job e.g open door, fill water (no other beverage) so you end up waiting a long time. They also take your food away from you before you have finished and give you bill before you are ready. Stressful, to say the least. Food: the local food is great, especially the Dahl. Lots of food available and we can’t complain. Not 5* but still very good. Facilities: they claim to have several bars and restaurant but there aren’t, or at least not in use. They also have mould in several areas, cracks and paint chipping. The toilets don’t have soap and are often untidy. Spa: fab! Loved it and worth a visit. Entertainment: avoid! Hotel should stick to the live music. The shows and plays ruin what would be a romantic evening with your other half. Overall: despite all this, we had a great holiday, but that was down to my husband and I laughing about it all and making the most of it. I would even recommend this place to others, but with the caveat - you get what you pay for. It’s a firm 3*. WiFi is also fab! Tip: visit some of the local restaurants on the beach! Great food. Also, stay away from ocean - strong currents and big waves. Can be very dangerous and if red flag is up your insurance won’t cover any accidents. Don’t forget to check your bill, they say 50% off but don’t give it to you unless you remind them. Expect an eye roll and potentially an argument before it happens.",negative

"We stayed at The Heritance for 6 in February. Staff were very friendly and helpful in all areas ; pool, bar, housekeeping & reception. Breakfast buffet was lovely & chefs were always around to check that everything was OK. Dinner buffet was nice, although slightly overpriced in comparison to the quality of food from the Al Carte Restaurant. Water Aerobics & Yoga were great additions, although they could be everyday (yoga only once a week & water aerobics 3 times). Beautiful setting by the beach. In my opinion, I would rate the hotel as a decent 4 star but not 5 star. Our room was an average size but quite old, it had no bath in the bathroom which I would expect in any 5 star property. We also had the unfortunate experience of cockroaches in our room. When we informed the front desk about this, they told us to speak to the house keeping manager (not our job to do whilst on holidays!) We expressed our concerns about the issue and said we would like to speak to the hotel manager as this wasn’t the customer service we expected in a 5 star - we were told the hotel manager was in a meeting & we never spoke to him/her. The staff we dealt with apologized for the inconvenience but it was up to us to ask if they could do anything to compensate, whether it be changing rooms etc. They offered us a complimentary meal at the buffet restaurant (which had never been relayed to restaurant staff & we were going to be charged!) We completely understand that cockroaches can get into rooms but having 1 crawl on you whilst in bed is not pleasant, had this been dealt with in a more efficient way it would have been better. Recreational facilities such as pool table & tennis rackets are chargeable which should really be part of the hotel. Check out other tour options & airport transfers as the hotel charges double, in some cases triple to decent outside providers.",positive
"Do not listen to those writing that the service is ignorant, for it is definitely not, you will be attended for any request, just keep in mind that the hotel is big and popular with the visitors, so let the service take some time. The rates are good, as well as the facilities. The place is not brand new, so you cannot expect fresh furniture, etc., but it feels like a solid 5-star hotel anyways, clean, spacious. The ocean is mostly rough to swim, but you can enjoy the pools or grab a cab to get to Unawatuna for a day. Nice library. The gym is different from the pictures on TA: the barbells have been removed, but the basics are still there for you. The breafasts are good, while I found the dinners to be overpriced if you go for a buffet option. There are many places around that are more affordable and enjoyable.",neutral
This was my third visit to this lovely property after a gap of 7 years and a lot has changed around ahungulla . The property is lovely as usual and the service great but the beach experience was average as there are hordes of hotels that have sprung up in the last few years around this sleepy town which has changed the demographics. What i like about this place is the lovely architecture by the genuis Geoffrey Bawa and the special emphasis on the food. The food is lovely and the hoppers served for breakfast in the live counter by these 2 charming local ladies was exceptional. But i should still say my previous experience has been much better but than again i dont blame the hotel for the crazy development all around the once upon a time charming Ahungulla.,positive
"Had a great stay at the Heritance - lovely staff, Rukmal in particular was really friendly and helpful with a great smile and could make origami animals out of towels......sounds weird but genuinely amazing and a nice surprise. 5 Star!",positive
"The hotel has a very beautiful location and fantastic pool areas. The staff is very friendly and provides excellent service. The food is also very good. You have two other nice restaurants close by on the Beach - White villa and Sunset restaurant. There is also another restaurant close by, the Jungle Beach, but they did not serve any food when I was there due to a volley ball tournament.",positive
"We had paid for a normal all inclusive so we're very surprised to be given this gorgeous suite with roof garden terrace. Everyone and everything about this hotel was perfect . Lovely food, staff, beach and ambiance .Asoka looked after us excellently on our floor and always gave 100% to be as helpful as possible. Many thanks Asoka.",positive
"Fantastic 8 night holiday in this beautiful hotel where everyone cannot do enough to ensure your stay is perfect, so much attention to detail in every area...food totally delicious, so much choice and variety from day to day (all inclusive), room impeccably clean and comfortable (standard) but above standard in quality and amenities. Both pools very lovely with attendants seeking to ensure everything is just the way you like it, as indeed are all staff in every area ALL the time. Cannot praise these lovely people enough. As we were celebrating a special occasion, had a very special 5 course dinner on the beach (obviously at additional cost) which was out of this world, both the food and the service absolutely perfect. Would definitely stay here again.",positive
"Stayed here as an extension of the very full on tour of Sri Lanka with Cox and Kings. Very relaxing and exceptional attentive room service, especially from Rukmal. Beach is beautiful but boy was it hot!",positive
"Over a period of around 25 years we have stayed here a total of 13 times - and have never been disappointed. Sometimes we have come here over the summer months, but lately we have opted for the period just before Christmas. Our last visit was for three, very enjoyable weeks. We had a corner room on the top floor and found it very comfortable indeed. Some reviewers have called the decor/furniture in the rooms old-fashioned.If your taste is for ultra-modern fittings and interiors this might be right, but there is a difference between old-fashioned and shabby. There is nothing shabby here. We always find the staff very accommodating and this last stay was no exception. The room boys kept everything tidy and clean and the waiters seemed to go out of their way to please us. We have known many of them for years, but I do not think that other guests received less of a service. Prior to Christmas there is a daily raffle in the hotel (the 'advent calendar') and we won a cookery lesson. We enjoyed that very much - and learned a lot. Best of all: we got to eat the results! Many thanks to chef Manjula for his patience and tailoring the menu to our preferences. We love the beach at Ahungalla and try to go for a walk there whenever the weather permits. Despite the new(ish) Riu hotel further along, it remains a very quiet stretch of pristine sand. There are a few hawkers there, but they are friendly and generally will take 'no' for an answer if you are not interested in their offerings. We always try to fit a trip to other parts of the island into our schedule. There are several people 'on the beach' or 'by the entrance gate' who can arrange such trips - some perhaps more reliable (and reasonable in terms of price) than others. We have used Eranda and his uncle Michael for quite a few years. You can contact Eranda on WhatsApp (+94 77 664 1538) or via email (liyanageerandap@gmail.com). He also has a tuk-tuk and can collect you from the reception area. We have often hired him for a whole day (to take us round the local beaches or further afield). Since we prefer Sri Lankan cuisine to 'international food', we generally use the 'coffee shop' restaurant rather than the main one. The rice&curries there are superb (and very reasonably priced). A special thanks to Sanjun who pulled out all the stops to get us our favourite ones. Breakfast at the Heritance is a sumptuous affair, with a huge range of different offerings. Hoppers and a curry, with some fruit afterwards, are my personal favourites. My wife prefers an omelet - as I said, the breakfast options cater for virtually any imaginable taste. So, thanks to everyone at the Heritance for making our stay there so enjoyable again. We will be back!",positive
"We booked a luxury room during our stay, room was spacious and large, however the furniture was old. From the time we arrived we got excellent service right through to the departure. They also have meal upgrade options which for some reason I missed and only found out night before leaving. It's a option worth considering. We had dinner at the restaurant which was excellent in portion sizes and quality and also very reasonably priced. The location however is something to be considered as it is out of everything, other than the hotel there's not much outside.",positive
"After visiting Sri Lanka 4 times over the last 6 or 7 years visiting several different hotels, I have to say I wasn’t overly impressed with the Hotel. We stayed for a week in January and to be honest the hotel was ok, the staff were great and the setting beautiful. But I have to buck the trend of good reviews because to be honest the food was average at best. As mentioned above my wife and I have visited Sri Lanka many times without any issues. But unfortunately by the second night my wife and I came down with severe diarrhoea and stomach cramps which lasted the whole week. This could have only been the food or drink because we always drink bottled water. You also dont expect ongoing hotel maintenance in high season with mobile scaffold in the hotel entrance and around the front of the pool for 3 days. Seeing men with breathing equipment sending huge clouds of white smoke into the air in the courtyard outside our room. It was so bad we had to put a towel at the bottom of our door. All together if wasn’t for the setting and the staff it would have been a poor stay in a 5 star resort.",negative
We went to this hotel for a weekend stay with another family. Hotel looked very old but since this is a Geoffrey Bava creation it’s still of so much value. We stayed for one night and was on full board basis. Food was average because of the variety. Sri Lankan food was there but still for a 5 star hotel not good enough. Staff were friendly but overall service needs to improve. They lacked energy and interests. Across the hotel we felt there was some sense of boredom. Room was ok but then again it looked old style if you like them. Overall this is a good hotel which may be in need of a new theme and a service upgrade.,neutral
Perfect weekend gateway for anyone who r seeking a beach vacation ♥️♥️♥️ Everything is so good. We stayed only one night but thorough out our stay staff treated us so nicely. They were so friendly & helpful. All rooms have partial sea view but there is a free entrance to the beach. Last but not least food was incredible u can do buffet or a la carte on ur choice. Highly Recommended 😍😍,positive
Stayed at Heritance Ahungalle for 3 nights from 13th January to 17th January 2019 with my 2 brothers and 2 sisters. I must confess that we all had a wonderful stay getting all the comforts expected. Special mention must be made of Thushara Gnanarathna for his cordiality. Thanks for all the facilities provided and we look forward to coming back again very soon.,positive
We had very nice experience in this hotel ..And also i want share with you its such a nice place nice product for all the human being ..so comfortable.

"It sure was a welcome change after couple of years of absences. We were welcomed by Lakshitha & Anuradha. Unfortunately, we were staying for one night on BB basis. Breakfast had both Western & Sri Lankan entrees. Of course, the taste and quality was excellent!! Rooms and overall experience were excellent and its only 60Km from the Colombo!!!",positive
"We have just returned from our relaxing holiday at The Heritance Ahungalla. We had a great welcome form the staff, who showed us to our room. The room was very clean and comfortable. The only slight negative is that the lighting was a bit dim. We found the grounds of the hotel well kept by a team of hard working gardeners. The swimming pools were both in great condition, lovely and clear at not to much chlorine as some pools have. The pool boys ensured you had a sun bed with a mattress and towels. Special thanks to Dinesh for all his help. We ate all our meals in the buffet restaurant and really enjoyed the local Sri Lankan dishes. The staff in the restaurant were polite and friendly. Restaurant captain Rohann was excellent. He is a friendly very hard working professional member of staff. He works extremely hard to ensure you enjoy your meal, the table gets cleared between courses and you get your wine when required. Every few days in the evening a member of the reception staff would circulate around the bars and restaurants asking how your holiday was going and if there were any problems? It’s the first time we have experienced that at that frequency. I thought that it was a good idea, if you had a problem they sorted it very quickly. The hotel are interested on improving and keeping their clients happy which is a positive compared to other hotels. The beach was fairly clean to walk, unfortunately red flags were out all the time. You could see why, with the very strong undercurrent. There are hawkers on the beach who are quite persistent. We told them politely “no thank you “ and in the end they got the message. Unfortunately sometimes they would slightly encroach onto the hotel grounds. I understand that they have to make a living, but I think people would probably buy more if they had their wears on show on the beach and not be pushy. In all we really enjoyed our holiday, we could relax and chill. We found found all the staff very helpful, polite and friendly and a credit to the hotel. We would like to return to The Heritance for another holiday some day.",positive
Stayed for one night half board .The hotel has two large swimming pools .Warm welcome by the friendly staff.The rooms and service provided were good.Beautiful golden beach but sea was fairly rough. Enjoyed the stay,positive
"We loved it: beautiful long and wide beach, very friendly personal, super delicious food with a high variety of different tastes and an excellent New Years party. Having had the chance to meet and to cook with excellent and most friendly Chef de Cousine Manjula made my day and holiday experience complete. Thank you so much!!! We will definitely come again! See you next year 👋😃🏝",positive
"If you are going to visit this amazing desitination, head there soon and stay at the Heritance Ahungalla - a true oasis of calm and rejuvenation. Right next door is the Hotel Riu - an ugly blot on the shoreline that reminds you more of holidays in the 70s in Benidorm, than resting in the idyliic spot that Sri Lanka is. Word on the street is that next door to the Riu an 800 bed hotel is planned - ruination of the beach thanks to the developers who seem to be focussed more on quantity not quality.",negative
"Enjoyed the comfort of the clean and comfortable room, lovely walk down the beach, enjoyed a swim in the pool, and the array of tasty food morning, afternoon and night at the buffet. Ideal location for a reunion with friends.",positive
Staying here now having been on a week long tour of Sri Lanka. The Hotel is right on the beach so you can hear the sound of the sea wherever you are. I am staying in room 303 and wake up every morning to the view of the sea. Having toured for a week around the country I was looking forward to some rest and relaxation which I certainly got here. Booked into the spa and had the most relaxing facial and massage. There are plenty of food options available from buffet style to al la carte so plenty for everyone to enjoy. Staff are extremely attentive and go out of their way to help. Thoroughly recommend the hotel and its staff,positive
"We are staying already for one week at the Heritance. As we are retired Hotel-Executives, we can well comment on this property. From the allpresent Executive Staff to the Staff of Reception, Restaurant, Pool, Room, Bar, Garden and Kitchen, we experience every Day their friendliness. All Staff are very communicative and well in English. They are always helpfull und you can feel how proud they are to work for this Hotel. Our Room 131 is faceing the Pool. By 7AM the Deckchairs are ready set at your prefered Area. The Room is well equiped and well maintained. A special Thanks to RUKMAL, our Roomboy. He keeps the Room spotless clean and surprises us Daily with one of his Towel-Creations. The Food-Selection on the daily Buffet is immense, with Lots of Local Goodies , International Kitchen and many live Cooking-Stations. We hope to enjoy the remaining Days at this beautiful Resort, and we are planing to be back by End of the Year.",positive

Excellent Food and Service. Staff are friendly and helpful. Spread Buffet. Beautifully Location. Smiley Front Department Staff. I strongly recommend for All please go and Enjoy. Room Number 357. Special thanks to General manager and Management Team. Thanks.,positive
"The setting of the hotel could not be more idyllic, the landscaping and architecture are beautiful. We upgraded to a larger room and were very pleased we did so as it gave us access to the Green pool. The pool man and our lovely housekeeping man Rukmal looked after us very well. A small tip goes long way and is appreciated. We had dinner B&B, and in hindsight we should have opted for B&B only as there are many beach restaurants within walking distance who serve good food - it makes a nice change. Wine is expensive so stick to cocktails or Lion beer, which is very nice.",positive
First time in Sri Lanka but have done Goa so knew what to expect The heritance hotel in AHungala is former five star colonial styled hotel set in beautiful grounds with a magnificent beach golden sands which stretches for miles The rooms are comfortable and clean the staff are extremely friendly and the service is great The buffet style restaurant offers good selection but it gets bit boring if your there for two weeks as we’re We went for the all inclusive package which is a bit of a joke as apparently all inclusive does not include a whole list of things inc wine at the bar use of the merge sports facilities anything from the mini bar etc. The main problem with the hotel is it’s loaction once you walk out of the heavily guarded front gates you are straight onto the main columbo to Galle Road The reality of Sri Lanka hits you with a vengeance the local village is a ram shackle mess of half finished buildings with rubbish piled up everywhere The road itself is a constant stream of horn blowing buses lorries car taxis and the famous TUk TUk Not the picturesque photos seen in the holiday brochures It’s also a long way from the main tourist triangle where the main temples and sigara rock are located We did the two day trip the return journey was six and half hours mainly stuck in traffic not pleasant I was ever to return to Sri Lanka I would certainly choose the location of the hotel so as to be closer to the sights maybe week in Kandy the week at the beach,negative
"I have stayed at this property before. This time too was a great experience. Stayed two nights with wife and two kids. Check in and out was smooth, staff were very nice and accommodating, the facilities were good, kids friendly, good food. No hesitation in giving a five star rating!",positive
Enjoyed a juicy and delicious Jumbo Prawn in a sauce with rice and veg (a la carte) at Heritance Ahungalla restaurant today. Still dreaming of the experience! The mutton samosas and the pakoras were a delightful starter. Thank you! Hope to catch the delicious Kottu (made by chef Skanda) again at the dinner buffet before I leave SL. Yum!!!!,positive
"We decided to go to Herritance Ahungalla during the Christmas holidays , this is three years after our first visit to the hotel. It was very encouraging to see the service was extremely good as it was three years ago, staff was very helpful and friendly , special note to be made on sous chef Manjula who was personally looking into the needs of the guests at the main restaurant , such a personal care make travelers feel very good. The room facilities were very good . The hotel is highly recommended",positive
"Our family 9 people visited the hotel yesterday, Sunday 06th January 2019 for day outing. The staff from the Resident Manager, Assistant Front Office Manager, F&B Manager and others were very helpful and given us the best assistance and support. The ambiance is really amazing. The pool is ideal for relaxation. The Drinks in the pool bar is so good especially the cocktails. The lunch buffet is a large spread. Overall we enjoyed the outing a lot and thank you all for looking after us.",positive
"With a 4.5 Tripadvisor rating, and nearly 3,000 people rating it either excellent or very good, it’s hard to be the minority guest who complains, and this is perhaps the problem – a little like The Emperor’s New Clothes; if enough people say it’s great, then surely it must be great ? Well no, not necessarily . . . while the hotel is very good in many respects, it has a few underlying failings that are not expected in a hotel of this grade, with the whole experience only held together by a brigade of (on the whole) excellent staff to detract from what was largely a disappointing stay in a number of respects. CHECK IN Absolutely 5 star; we did not even go to the desk; our luggage disappeared in one direction while we were led to the poolside bar and given cold fruit juice while our check-in was processed. We were then escorted to our room and shown the mini-bar, air-con, etc. Very difficult to fault, and a first class welcome. ACCURACY OF BOOKING The first let-down; we requested a top floor quiet room, not overlooking the pool. We got a 1st floor room, not only overlooking the pool with a sideways sea view, but directly over the pool bar. Due to the horse-shoe design around the pool, we assumed all rooms faced the pool; it was only a few days into our holiday we discovered an additional wing either side of this with garden / sea views. By this time we were well and truly unpacked, but how difficult would it have been to read our request and put us in the appropriate room on arrival? ROOM FACILITIES A little tired and showing signs of age, but on the whole everything you need. Excellent a/c that is on 24/7, unlike many hotels where it goes off when you remove your key card. Sliding door-type window blinds that gave a complete night time black-out. Safe in wardrobe, but on top of a small chest, so hanging anything above meant clothes draped over the safe – obscuring the safe and creasing clothes. Extremely comfy beds with daily linen change; ditto daily towel change. Uncomfortable sofa in room and ditto 2 x chairs on balcony; not designed for long chilled evenings – perhaps they would prefer you to be in the bar instead of drinking on your balcony? BATHROOM Excellent shower with toiletries topped up daily. Extraction not 100%, with lots of steam and condensation after showering. A down-side also is the hair dryer; hard-wired to a spur in the bathroom meaning 2nd person could not shower until 1st person had dried hair, or 1st person sat in the room with wet hair while 2nd person showered. Also no nozzle on hairdryer making styling impossible. A strange design of windows in the bathroom stud walls with Venetian blinds; lots of gaps all around, meaning you will need to be on very good terms with whoever you are sharing with. DINING The biggest disappointment of all; we had read all the reviews prior to booking, and were geared up for a feast of real Sri-Lankan buffet nightly; The reality was the same thin, on-the-bone chicken curry trotted out daily, with some variation of veg sides; biggest disappointment was that for the whole 10 days, including 2 Gala Dinners, we did not eat anything that was truly hot. All dishes, from breakfast through to the last dinner, were tepid or luke-warm, with some cold. The selection of dishes might be huge, but the quality is well, well below this grade of hotel. A big issue was the amount of large tables for 12 or more that dominated the dining room to accommodate the several large parties who were there; we struggled daily to find a table for 2 that was not sandwiched between one of these. The sound of grizzling children and loud parents all shouting over each other became the backdrop for all of our eating; the last time I ate in this type of environment was at Pontins Blackpool in 1990. A mass dining hall, not a 4/5 star hotel restaurant. YOUR FELLOW GUESTS We were told by several different staff members that rooms are routinely sold off at highly discounted rates to Sri Lankan and Indian families; not what you want to hear when you have just spent 5K on your holiday . . . This ensured a strange mix of European honeymoon couples, families who had booked through a tour operator, and a disproportionally huge amount of large families of 12-16 who had grabbed a bargain. This was echoed in the dress code – or lack of – in the restaurant, with people rolling up in beachwear and skimpy shorts, while reception was awash with people dashing from the pool to the lift in swimwear, dripping wet and soaking the tiled floors. More 3 star Spain in the 1980’s than a 4/5 star experience. THE STAFF Perhaps the nicest, calmest, and politest staff we have ever come across anywhere in the world, which I fear is what stops most people from complaining or ‘making a fuss’. One or two exceptions; the cashier who, on our changing up money, threw back 2 x £20 notes with a sneer saying ‘dirty money Madame’ because they had pen marks on, (from the bank not us I may add); The boy on reception who, on being asked for help with train times, told my wife to ‘look it up on line’ then took her phone, switched off flight mode, and connected her to International Roaming; cue a dozen updates and text messages from U.K. Thanks for that; we await our O2 bill with some trepidation. ENTERTAINMENT As above, more 1970’s than post-milenium, with the same dated song-book standards being peddled out nightly by a band who are in desperate need of a lead singer. NEW YEAR GALA DINNER This deserves a review in it’s own right – a band who had been warming up since 5.00 in the afternoon playing 80’s American rock at an ear-splitting volume; a D.J. who begins his set with Bohemian Rhapsody and Another Brick in the Wall; and best of all – a beauty contest by the pool that started around 10.30 p.m. and resumed again after the New Year count-down. Once again, ‘entertainment’ more worthy of Pontins or Haven than a luxury resort, and more to the point, a spectacle that the U.K. consigned to the history books some 40 years ago. As for the food; more of the same; a huge spread, and the work the kitchen put into creating a wonderful display was a marketing exersize worthy of Satchi and Satchi, with hundreds of photos appearing on Facebook and Instagram world-wide; sadly, nothing hot enough to enjoy. ACCURACY OF YOUR TAB ON CHECK-OUT This has to be the prize for staff member(s) most in need of re-training; On paying our bill at 7.00 a.m. on check-out day, we were amazed to see over £200 had been added as a ‘half board surcharge’ when we had booked and paid for half board with mercury holidays. Perhaps they hoped we would not notice? Well, we did, and the resulting argument was not a great start to the day. ‘Sorry Sir, he is training’ . . . , sorry, but training or not, somebody input the charge into the computer when it should have been absolutely clear what board basis we were booked in on. Another sting, (which we were aware of before arrival so we factored in) is the 10% service and 15% Govt. tax that is added to all advertised prices, making a hefty difference to your bottom line. IN SUMMARY A rather pretentious and tired hotel that could very easily be a great hotel if a few easy-fixes were put in place; This is unlikely however when the staff ask ‘is everything ok’ and we all say ‘oh yes; it’s lovely . . . ‘ They will continue doing more of the same until guest stop being in awe of the overall experience, wake up and smell the coffee, and politely tell them where they are going wrong.",positive
"I was there in July 2018 with my newly married wife. We used to travel around a world (from Europe, Asia to South America) and what we have to admit - we are very positively surprised by the local people whom we met in Sri Lanka. We are stunned by the kindness and warmness of the hotel's Heritance Ahungalla crew who was always ready to help us, talk and exchange experineces about local specialities - such as food, places worth to see or even costs that we should planned while traveling on our own. We would like to higly recommend them: Vimukthi Ishan, Jagath Vimukthi, Anuruddhi Bandara and Danuka Rakitna - ketachen chef, that gave us recepie for the best Egg Hoper ever! Thanks to this people our trip was even more memorable.",positive
My return stay to Heritance Ahungalla once again was excellent. Points of interest would be the personalised service tendered by the front office staff as well as the food and beverage staff to attend to your special needs. The only point to improve would be the food quality at the pool bar was not up to standard. The snack menu offered also should be changed where a selection of local and continental food can be offered where the guest can order as most of guest stay at the pool area. A big thank you to Srinath ( FOM ) and the F/B team led Rasika.,positive
"A beautiful hotel, with a long sweeping drive down to an ornamental lake from where we could see through the spacious marble reception hall to the infinity pool and beyond to the beach and the sea. A perfect location. Everywhere was clean and well tended. The restaurants offered a wide variety of food and the evening entertainment was most enjoyable. There were ramps around the hotel for wheelchair users, but oddly no ramps to provide access to the restaurants. We had an excellent stay here. Geraldine and Frank",positive
"I am disappointed with Heritance,Ahungalla very much, for pick up taxi from the airport to the hotel did not appear in spite of calling and sending e-mail to request. Further worse, the hotel man said that this occasion had happened because I had not sent him confirmation e-mail and ordered me to call the taxi by myself when I telephoned him to help us with nervous at the air port. After all, I ordered him to arrange the taxi and my husband and I could reach the hotel by local uncomfortable taxi. When I arrived at the Hotel, he did not appear, and no one touched this situation. So I requested to meet him, but he did not appear. So I requested to meet the hotel manager, at last He appeared. He did not apology and insisted he had never received confirmation e-mail, but had done his best. So I showed him my mobile to prove sending him confirmation e-mail after 8 minute later his e-mail. He insisted that he had never received e-mail by showing me his mobile(perhaps he cut my confirmation e-mail)and at last unwillingly apologized me. This time, My husband sent e-mail to request the taxi~ no reply, then I sent e-mail~no reply. Then I telephoned to request taxi, and then received the e-mail with taxi fee and requesting confirmation reply, so I sent back shortly. Is Heritance Ahungalla good hotel? I have never meet such a rude and impolite hotel man like him. I sent my opinion to improve hotel by e-mail and left the hotel's questionnaire sheet, but I have not received anything.",negative
"We spent ten days in this beautiful hotel with great service. It's as a fairy time for us. Everyone is so smiling and so kindly. So calm and so peaceful, so restful. Luxury in natural environment. High standard in accommodation and service. Lovely meals with local accents. We have there wonderful wedding ceremony with so professional hotel's organisation. We spend there a lovely time and we wish to come back there in future. Very special thanks to Himasha for her special smile for us and so many professionalism in coordination of our wedding. From first minute we believe that we are in good hands and we don't disappoint :) It was great job 👍 and thanks for Tinko for special local delicious food. Thanks for all customer service - it was pleasure to be your guest :) Dorothy and Sebastian :)))))",positive
"Our extended family of 7 which included 3 adults, 3 children and a grandmother had the most perfect holiday in this heavenly hotel. The rooms are large and beautifully furnished. Spotlessly clean. They were cleaned and prepared twice a day. All the staff were so friendly and helpful. When our TV kept freezing, just a phone call to the reception at 10pm, and 2 engineers were at our door in 5 min. They replaced our TV immediately. The food was absolutely divine! Such a huge variety of food to suit both the local and the tourist palette. The two pools were wonderful. Plenty of comfortable seating around the pool, fresh towels and mats brought immediately. The children just adored playing in both pools. The beach was beautiful and the sea was paradise. There was nothing that could have made our holiday better. Thank you to all the staff and the management. We will certainly be back when we return to Sri Lanka.",positive
"Compared to other hotels in the Heritance chain, I believe that Heritance Ahungalla has a long way to go. We had arrived to the hotel at around 1.30PM knowing that the check-in time is 2PM, however due to their high occupancy the previous day, we were only checked into our room at 3.30PM. The food definitely has room for so much improvement despite the large variety. Some meals very excellent and some were very poor. There wasn't any consistency maintained in the quality of the food. For example; the day we arrived, lunch was excellent but the dinner buffet was terrible. Rooms are very spacious and comfortable. Surroundings and environment is very beautiful and peaceful, loved the beach! The housekeeping service was quite efficient and without any time restriction was willing to clean the rooms. Overall staff was very friendly and helpful, which made the staff very pleasant. Overall I'd grade the hotel as a 4* Star but definitely enjoyed our 3-day stay",positive
Not at all a 5 star hotel. Would have chosen a better hotel for this price and facilities. It’s a mediocre 3 star hotel. Front staff made us wait for 1 hr before handing over keys to our rooms. Bathroom was clogged. No response by housekeeping. Paid for sea view facing rooms instead got pool side rooms. Would not stay or recommend to stay at this place.,negative
Food were really delicious and room service were good and also their staff Good hotel for enjoy with family or friends or couples . Parking available Spa available Dance floor available Rooms are superb,positive
It is a very good hotel with excellent facilities. Verity of food international and local . Friendly staff. 2 swimming pools. one is specially allocated for in house guests . SPA and various other facilities. Lovely place,positive
"I woul not recommend this hotel. Specially if you plan to come here on vacation during weekdays. They host weddings and the noise level is really high. We experienced this on a Thursday night where the band that was playing, played until 11 pm at night. It is not a relaxing experience. The noise was overwhelmingly loud. We called the management but they said the loud outdoor music will go on till 11 pm. The service at the restaurants were very slow and unresponsive too. The bars served cocktails that wasn't made properly. It was a disappointing experience at this hotel for us. Will not return here",negative
"We are absolutely amazed by our experience with Heritance Ahungala. It's top class from the time we arrived to our check out. The hotel itself is amazing but the attention to detail given by its staff is what really sets it apart. We would like to give a special thanks to Rukmal who took care of our room, went that extra step to make us feel comfortable, and even made beautiful figurines out of towels ❤️. Also Sous Chef D. J. Manjula for making sure our dining experience was exceeding our expectations. One can't go wrong with choosing Heritance hotels as so far our stays with them is just magical! Vin and Olle",positive
All the house keeping and decorating work like towel arts impressed us a lot. He’s a nice guy always smiling and very helpful. His good morning and good evening was always heart felt. He’s an employee of worth. Made us feel like home. Thank you,positive
"Super good location, big suitable rooms, very very friendly personal. Always everywhere clean. Kitchen is excellent and good choices of food. Pool is very good. Lot of attention to children. Every evening animation.",positive
What takes away your breath is the infinity pool and the beach alongside the hotel property. The Christmas decorations just added more color and festivity to the season! Rooms are spacious and fully equipped with essential amenities. The buffet spread is like amazing even for a vegetarian person. Variety of desserts were superb! Even the spread of food items in the restaurant was carefully placed such that they could accommodate the guests in a comfortable way. One of the most luxurious hotels in the Southern Coastline of Sri Lanka with effortless service and hospitality. Keep up the good work!,positive
This is our one of the favourite hotel. We love to come here. Everything was perfect. Specially the staff and the service was excellent... Nothing to complain.. Enjoyed the stay very much and we will be back for sure...,positive
Had a wonderful experience and staff is excellent and well experienced. foods are tasty and me and all staff members with family members enjoyed a lot. We had 4 trips with around 535 pax. All are appreciate this trip.,positive
"Just spent 2 weeks at the Heritance Ahungalla, and cannot fault it in any way. Rooms cleaned daily, linen changed daily, towels changed twice daily. Staff on hand at all times, and they were so helpfull. Nothing too much trouble for them. Highly recommend this hotel and would certainly go back.",positive
"From the second we arrived the service from the staff was first class. Nothing was ever too much trouble. Welcomed with a hot flannel and drink, check in was simple and effortless, rooms are a good standard, clean and have all you require. Daily cleaning and twice daily towel change are just added touches the hotel provide. Bars, restaraunt and pools are first class.",positive
Loved everything about this hotel the beach view is amazing along with swimming pool and breakfast was great. Coming here was great experience and had amazing time and definitely worth visiting it again,positive
"We have had the best weeks holiday at the Heritance Ahungalla. The hotel rooms are clean and modern 10/10, we had an ocean view deluxe room. The overal hotel is 5 star 10/10. The staff are FANTASTIC, they bend over backwards for you. Nothing is ever too much trouble. I need to mention one member of staff Waruna who absolutely made our holiday. He is AMAZING. Thank you to regards the Parker Family x",positive
"We took two rooms for 1 night, Overall it was a good stay. Deluxe rooms are very old and not recommended to anyone, There were bugs and mosquitos in Deluxe room. Therefore, We upgraded to Premier rooms. Special thank to front office officer Shanika for her great assistance. I truly recommend Shanika as a Polite, Professional employee.",positive
"I didnt stay here but stopped for lunch on my way to Colombo from Galle. The property looks amazing, with its own secluded beach. Lunch was wonderful. The lasagne and asian prawns with rice were both extremely tasty.",positive
We had a lovely time in this beautiful hotel.This is our first visit and we will come back again. Food was very good and we enjoyed our stay a lot. The view is amazing and this hotel is a superb place to relax.,positive
"I have been visiting Heritance Ahungalla almost yearly for more than 10 years now. The food and staff service towards the guests has been to the highest standard. Most importantly this has been maintained consistently throughout the years, which is a great feat.",positive
"This hotel is crazy. Everything from the welcoming to departure was awesome. Everybody is smiling and every time. Rooms are very clean, WiFi excellent, and the food... the food ... IT IS REALLY GOOD. Great view from the room with beautiful sunset, the staff is really friendly. I recommend this hotel for any occasion",positive
"We take the Chance, to say „thank you“ to all the People, who are working in the Heritance Ahungalla. You make it really oomfortable to the guests. Special greetings to our roomservice, Mr. Rukmal. He is a really wonderful person and he is doing a wonderful job, that gives us the feeling of beeing special guests. With best regards, your guests from room 133, Nicola and Axel",positive
Heritable Ahungalla is a wonderful place to relax and enjoy.. it has a superb beach... we came here to spend the day with my family.. but definitely we will be back to stay one or two days... thank you for the wonderful hospitality...,positive
Very peaceful hotel with beautiful pools. So nice to wake to the sound of waves...and the best breakfast in Sri Lanka...Rukmal left a nice surprise in the name of our favourite NZ cricketer on our bed with swan and hibiscus ;-),positive
A hotel on the beach where time is lost to total relaxation. Great food with chef prepared to do specials and house keeping prepared to attend to all your needs. Some rather special towel creations adds a special Sri Lankan delight. Amazing!,positive
"Stayed here for a week recently during the Galle test match, the hotel is located right on the beach, the staff were very friendly and couldn’t be more helpful. The restaurant serves decent varieties of food and all were delicious. The pools serving the hotel were again both excellent. If in the area well worth checking this hotel out.",positive
we spent our day with my family it was fantastic.friendly staff and excellent service.nice view..enjoyed main pool..recommended to my friend who want to have relax your holiday.defenently we are coming back and thanks for all staff.,positive
"We just came to spend our day, that was fantastic and we enjoyed a great time here. Food and service was excellent and it was very yummy. We would like to recommend this hotel to everyone because this place is very beautiful.",positive
This is our secondvvusit to this beautiful place...staf and the service is amazing here.also food is fabulous ..spcially the sunday buffet with lots of selection.. excellent hospitality we ever had....,positive
"We had a lovely, great time with my family. Enjoyed the pool, food and the fantastic service of the hotel. Everyone was so friendly and we love the time we spend here. Special thanks to Resident Manger Manoj and his team at Heritance for the memorable stay.",positive
"A unique hotel, great service, but it’s getting old and needs work Whilst the room (suite) was large and well appointed, the bathroom in particular needs renovation. It’s just getting old and needs work. In particular the shower over a massive spa bath would be very difficult for someone unsteady on their feet to get into - apart from holding on to the glass shower screen there was nothing to hold on to. There was areas of the hotel obviously no longer used, an upstairs bar above reception was empty, the locked billiards room, and the empty kids club were all looking sad and unloved. With some investment in the rooms and some public areas this hotel could easily beat the new chain hotels springing up",neutral
This place is the best to relax. Service is the best among all and the taste of the yummy food and drinks cannot forgot. Whenever I wanna relax definitely visit this place at anytime. Without any hesitation I can recommend this place to anyone.,positive
"We just came for a short break with my friends,food and drinks are really good and we enjoyed our time.Hope to come back again and we will recommend the lovely hotel to all. Friendliness of the staff is the best .",positive
"this was my 2nd visit.and its been a pleasure stay.room was clean,food was good only down side was the service of the stewards.had to wait more than 30 minutes for a coffee.and they go pass us like they are deaf even when i call them.",positive
"My family and me (including 2 senior citizens) visited this beautiful hotel this November. Every thing about it is great Lovely property, extremely warm and friendly staff and scrumptious food. Being a pure vegetarian family they made special arrangements for us for the food. We took the half board deal (Breakfast and dinner). Not only is the property good but the rooms are equally enjoyable. Neat clean and quick service. A 10/10 rating for Heritance Ahangulla",positive
"We stayed a week on an all inclusive deal. Very friendly, relaxed atmosphere on the beach. Lovely room, good size and quiet. Two pools, each with a bar serving good food and snacks whenever you require.the hotel restaurants also offer amazing choice of food each evening, the Sri Lankan food is wonderful. The hotel also will organise short trips to see the local sites, and a day trip to Galle is recommended. Thoroughly recommended for a week to get away from it all. Although quite a large hotel we always felt there were not too many people around, and the pools were not crowded when we stayed on the property. Staff lovely too.",positive
Heritance ahangulla ...sound of waves .. feel the wind and sand.. awesome ambience ... stunning pools to relax ... live music ... a disotheque .... something for all ages .. a fun place to be in with family and friends,positive
"The hotel is a beautiful Bawa designed property with an impressive lobby that overlooks and infinitely pool that goes out to the edge of the beach with the ocean just beyond. The rooms are large and well maintained. But the food was really below average and the service bordered on the indifferent. The dining hall staff were really quite awful and looked and behaved like they hated their job. Tables not cleared, no one coming to check on you etc. Very disappointing on that end. The housekeeping and the rest if the staff were good. Will not return.",negative
"For the fourth time I had the pleasure to stay at Heritance Ahungalla Hotel. Again it was very pleasant to find the same welcoming and authentic staff members as the times before with their wonderful friendliness. The hotel is wonderfully designed and ""hidden"" in a beautiful garden: the first thing you see when you get out of the car is the gorgeous infinity pool and the open reception area, where there is always a pleasantly cool breeze. The two pools are very clean and beautifully maintained early in the morning. The pool guards are extremely helpful in arranging sun beds and parasols according to the guest's wishes. The rooms are spacious and very clean. The housekeeping personell are extremely flexible and helpful. The restaurant offers excellent buffets (from breakfast to dinner) with a plentiful variety of local and other Asian dishes. The kitchen personnel with their Chef take great effort in spoiling their guests. I will definitely visit Heritance Ahungalla Hotel again.",positive
"This magnificently designed hotel is a few hours north of Galle, on the sea. Like other great Sri Lankan hotels the foyer/reception area is open so there is a wonderful, gentle sea breeze cooling the reception area even on the hotest day. There are 2 separate pools, both clean, and beautifully maintained. There is a huge tree ocer one them providing natural shade. The rooms are spacious and very clean. The buffet is plentiful but you can also order a la carte in a separate area of the dining room. The breakfast is excellent - so many choices. I had the best omelette I had on my trip (and I a few good ones). As in other Heritance hotels in Sri Lanka, the staff are welcoming, polite and honest. You're on the beach - but you can't swim as there's a dangerous rip. But, oh well, the pool's pretty nice anyway. You can always go for a walk on the beach instead. It felt so luxurious and its actually very reasonably priced.",positive
We hadan amazing time at this beautiful place... we came here for our honeymoon ...beautiful hotel with a lovely beach..we really enjoyed our stay... staff is very friendly abd helpful ..we will come back for sure....,positive
"Everytime I passed this hotel on my way to Down South and back there was something in this place which made me to go and have a stay in this awesome place. As I am always passionate about our Sri Lankan architect Mr. Geoffrey Bawa's designs, this was an ideal place for me. The pool area was very relaxing and enjoyed freedom to the maximum level in it. Loved the room interior and food served in the buffet. Hotel staff was also well trained and friendly..",positive
"This was an amazing place i have seen. I loved the way you welcoming the guests. Very friendly and always smiling staff. Rooms were Superb...high standard...Foods at the jude restaurant was amazing...every single meal has a burst of favours... The staff at restaurant was very helpful and service was high five... Overall extremely safe extremely clean and extremely beautiful every where... Specialy my thanks for Mr.Lakshitha , Mr.Thushara , Mr.Praveen , Mr.Nipun , Mr.Liyanage and Mrs. Himasha with all executive staff gave a warm welcome on arrival. And thank you soo much for the f&b staff for everything you offered me on my stay and thank you for front office crew for the upgraded. Thank you Randika & Belldesk staff for done a well checking. Finally all of you are doing fantastic.. I loved the hospitality and service quality received from the begging to the end...keep up the standards and improve your service ahead..... Highly recommended 👍🏼 Thank you Heritance Ahungalla team you all deserve every success.... see you again....",positive
I dropped in to this resort with my Wife for lunch while returning home from a meeting. Loved the welcome and the super hospitality by the front office crew and loved the juice cart that goes around serving the exotic juices .. i have been visiting this resort even before it re branded .. its indeed a beautiful resort . Not too happy on the Spread they had for the Buffet Lunch for the price paid .. but indeed the quality of the food that was there was 5 star.. it was a very basic spread .. May be it was due to the low occupancy.. i loved the hospitality and service quality received from the begging to the end .. keep up the good work and improve on the Buffer spread on weekdays ..,positive
Got upgraded to the luxury suite free of charge. Lunch and Breakfast buffet were exceptionally better than Dinner. Suite room should have had a jacqousi instead of the typical bath tub. Staff was great,positive
The ultimate dream of a hotel. I had my wedding here and every single guest is looking to return for a holiday. The Best service ever experienced. Highly recommend it. Extremely safe extremely clean and extremely beautiful in every way. Food is out of this world. Every single meal has a burst of flavours. Thank you Heritance Ahungalle team You all deserve every success Thanks Omarah,positive
Set in a beautiful beach location this property offers good standard of accomadation and good service at an affordable price. Would recommend to anyone travelling this way. A great find is if you take the two minute walk down the beach go to the Sun Shine Restaurant for great fresh sea food,positive
"We had a really good time here, food was a good standard with plenty of choice. The room was clean but I didn’t like having blinds on the bathroom window as you could still see in through the gaps - I like privacy in the bathroom. The staff are all very friendly and helpful- it was a shame thee is nowhere to tip that is shared between them as you can’t tip everyone constantly. The taxi/trip drivers are a bit irritating and you can’t even walk on the beach without being surrounded by them, this was the only down side that we found. They also try to sell trips to you in reception and one man was visibly annoyed with us because we had chosen to book with our TUI rep. Some people might find this intimidating. We would recommend a massage in the spa, wonderful! The pools are kept very clean and tidy, we spotted monkeys and a snake near the quiet pool. All in all we had a fabulous holiday, thank you to Heritance Ahungalla.",positive
"From the first instance, to the welcome received at the entrance to everything else after this hotel is just amazing! We stayed for two nights and even through the weather was not good, we still enjoyed the pool in the rain and did not feel claustrophobic at all as the rooms were very big. The best part of this hotel is the staff and the irresistible food ! Staff was very friendly and warm and welcoming, especially Varuna who served us most of the time. He was always friendly and hospitable. The buffet variety was different everyday and we enjoyed it very much because after visiting many hotels in Sri Lanka and tired of having the same food everywhere, it was great to see the wide spread and different choices. Well done to the management on making the initiative to be different and making the effort to offer the best food we had ! We also enjoyed the many amenities in the hotel, the pool, bar and spa. We loved our stay and definitely will return again, and I hope it would be still be same 👍🏻.",positive
"I’ve visited this hotel several times in the past, so I knew what to expect. I have to say that they have improved even more and the service was excellent. Chef Manjula and his staff went over and above to make sure we were well served. He had the kitchen bring out something special for my daughter who didn’t fancy some of the desserts. The food had a good mixture of local and international cuisine. The beach and swimming pool was so gorgeous and such a beautiful experience being in such beautiful surroundings.",positive
"I don’t have anything bad to say , But I don’t understand why they let pest ( Ferrell)dogs wondering around the hotel, and other concern is smokers got all the rights, we couldn’t find any where not smoking signs maybe hotel management not keep up with world trend about non smokers rights , please fix this we will be back surely Thanks",negative
"Arrived after a very long journey. Had a lovely warm greeting. The pool and sea that you see in front of you makes it all feel worth the long journey. We was taken to our room, we booked sea view with king size bed. We was taken to room 235, we immediately declined as the shower was so small, you would have struggled to turn or even wash in it! But also i took photos of how dirty and grubby the shower was as well. We called down to reception and someone came to our room straight away. We stated this was not acceptable for a 2 week stay, but another reason is that my partner is 6' 1"", not the smallest of people. They said that was ok, and would show us 2 other rooms. The 1st other room, the shower was just as grubby and grimy as the original room, i said no thank you. She then took us to a ground floor room that was 100% better, it wasn't that much bigger in size but it had twin beds (pushed together to make a king size) and from the doors outside over looked the garden and residents pool. We said that was much cleaner but did not have the requirements we booked and paid ALOT of money for. She told us this is all that was available, so we had to accepted one of the rooms, so we accepted this one. I asked if there was an extra charge and she said yes, 30 us dollars a night extra. We said we was going to complain to our travel company and she said no and to come to reception with her. We then saw a Manager, who was very friendly and said it was fine and there would be no extra charge. After 24 hours door to door this is the last thing i expected. i was hot and tired and we have been to the Indian Ocean many many times and never experienced this. It was disappointing. But all in fairness to the staff, they were great. We paid alot of money and made two requests and ended up with neither. We have always had a sea view and king size bed. What made it worse, was my partner proposed to me on our journey and it was fantastic, he organised alot of it with Emirates but this experience seemed to dampen it a bit. The hotel staff are so so friendly, they always make an effort to say good morning/afternoon. The hotel itself does need updating in some parts, especially the rooms. The entrance takes your breath away and to be honest, with that and the staff, it makes you not want to say anything bad, but you have to be honest. The food tastes great but very repetitive. Not a great choice. The sous chefs are absolutely fantastic. My partner had an upset belly for about 4 days, chef cooked him fillet streak quite a few times, they really go out of there way to help you. But i found i was mainly eating rice and salad. Weekends they have a bbq night, but again, the other stuff is all the same. The waiter/waitress were great, they get to know you, your room number and your drinks order. But they will come and clear the plates even if one of you are still eating. One night, a waitress started wiping the table whilst my partner was still eating, i had to ask her to stop. The pool attendant around the residential pool was lovely. He put our towels out every morning and greeted us when we arrived. Always spoke to us and said about places to visit. If you want to go out anywhere, expect a journey. Galle is lovely, the fort, the lighthouse and all the little shops down the lanes. There is a private museum there also which is very interesting. The tsunami museum was extremely upsetting and very humbling. The lady whos house was rebuilt, lost absolutely everything, even all memeber of her family, but still manages to smile. Some of the photos in there are upsetting, but it happened to them. We gave her a donation but wish we could have done more. The statue along Galle Road, is something to stop and see. Then you have some idea of how big the wave that came and hit this town was. We also went on a safari, 3 and half hours to get there, then 3-4 hours the jeep. It was ok, but a long way to go. we didnt get out of a car from 5am, transferred to jeep at 8.30am, then back into a car just gone mid day to return to the hotel. It was a very long day. Felt like travelling really. Outside the hotel you will get asked for a tuk tuk straight away. The guys walk down the road with you. They are harmless but we just wished they would leave us alone, but you dont want to be rude to them. But if you want an ATM, its about a 10 min walk, so you dont really have much choice. The beach is nice, this is the first time we have been to the Indian Ocean and have not seen sun loungers and parasols on the beach. You can certainly walk along the beach, but no one seems to relax on it!! They have a few shows on in the evening and there are a few bars for the evening. Overall, very relaxing holiday. Food ok, could have more choice. Staff very friendly, hotel needs updating.",positive
"A lovely hotel. Large, clean rooms, although with a lot of 'dead' space, could perhaps have been designed slightly better. We weren't happy with our original room and at first the staff were reluctant to move us saying there were no spare rooms. But when we were insistent, one materialised. The food and bar were great and the main pool was stunning. The secondary pool was also nice and much quieter. Lots to see and do in the area so well worth a stay. Would stay again.",positive
"Had a great time at the Heritance for my friend's wedding. Excellent service and the wedding was really well organised. Good food, great location and professional staff. Highly recommended - I thoroughly enjoyed",positive
"We love this beautiful place, view and the food is amazing. Service of the staff is very good and they are very helpful always.We always Enjoy our time with friends and it is a very relaxing hotel to spend holiday.",positive
"Eighty miles south of Colombo is 'Heritance Ahungalle', the five star resort hotel located on a 25 acre land. The road leading to the property is surrounded by trees and thick coconut groves on both sides ends at the large beautiful lotus pond in front of the hotel. Pleasant traditional welcome by the the staff, and we are into one of the legendary Geoffrey Bawa's architectural fantasies, designed as 'Triton'. The feeling of the spaciousness of the lounge and the picture-framed view of the sea, still comes back to my mind. It's a pleasure to meet again the General Manager Mr. Sisira Senaratne, a veteran and a iconic figure in the leisure industry, who won the prestigious TUI Top Quality award for 'Heritance Ahungalle', who is more than happy to see us there. Well maintained garden, two large outdoor swimming pools, the Infinity and Green (which has a tree stretches down almost inside the pool) also has a jacuzzi and a pool bar providing cool and refreshing thirst quenchers. There is a tennis / badminton court, a fitness centre with rowing, running and cross trainer machines including a weights section. Welcomed by Mr. Rasika Ratnayake, Food & Beverage Manager of Heritage Ahungalla another veteran of the hotel industry, had our lunch at 'Jute Restaurant', which have a nice view of the garden, pool and ocean. Apparently the name 'Jute' name is from the unusual blend of colours from the Ena de Silva batik-on-jute ceiling which provides dappled reflections. The buffet is Sri Lankan and International cuisine consisting of appetizers, soups, many kinds of salads, several kinds of breads, Rice, noodles, meat, chicken seafood and vegetables. There was a live action food station cooking prawns too, which we enjoyed very much. Many kinds of delicious desserts and freshly cut fruits. Ours is only a day outing yet we had an excellent time with some of the friendliest and most welcoming people you could wish to meet. Great place to be on a weekend day outing on top of a wedding and honeymoon desination.",positive
"The best thing about the hotel is the food and the location, perfect to relax with the breeze of the sea. I will recommend this place to anyone who wants to spend a relaxing time with friends and family.",positive
"We had an amazing time at this hotel, during which we held a wedding ceremony and party with our friends and family. The hotel has 2 big pools and is directly on the beach. The staff were amazing in helping us arrange the wedding and catering to the needs of the party, in total there was 31 in the group. All the staff were amazing but in particular Shanika & Paveen created an event to remember and took away any stress we may have had in organizing everything. We had a ceremony on the beach followed by a BBQ, and the use of the on site nightclub. Everyone had a great day. All the party commented on how good the food was, we even had vegans and vegetarians who were happy with the food on offer. We will definitely be coming back to this hotel, as we have created many special memories here. We can highly recommend anyone coming to stay as you'll have an amazing time.",positive
"I've just returned home from Sri Lanka and a wedding, Kad and Chloe, at this lovely hotel. It was a really nice place to stay and a beautiful wedding. Many thanks to all the helpful staff for making this occasion all the more special for the happy couple.",positive
"They have a nice environment to relax with in both beach & huge pool. Room are tidy & nice. Everything is perfect except the buffet. The food was horrible on our stay, specially the lunch. Breakfast was quite good comparing to other meals. Staff is friendly.",positive
"Heritance Ahungalla was the destination of the annual trip organized by our company this year. We had a large crowd which was 200+ adults and children. Just after entering the property from the Colombo-Galle main road we felt the difference. Most of the hotels in the area just opens up to the main road but this was not. After following beautifully paved path surrounded with trees, the main building of the hotel appeared which had a large pond in front of it which was again a very pleasant sight. Once our buses arrived the staff scrambled to help the crowd with luggage and welcome them. They have arranged a special desk for us to handle the check-in. Everything went very smoothly and we saw a very coordinated effort of the staff. The hotel itself is gorgeous. Once you are in the lounge you could feel it being infinitely spacious. The swimming pool, the beach and the sea which are next to each other amplify it greatly fulfilling the vision of the architect Geoffrey Bawa (As I have learned later after watching the intro video on the room TV). The rooms were very good with all the necessary amenities and very clean. Me and my colleagues were very satisfied with it. The RFID card based key system was very nice. No need to play around with keys and very easy to carry around. Never seen it in any of the other older hotels. The main restaurant served yummy food to us. Though the buffet spread is not very large when compared to the hotels in Colombo it was complete with all the necessary bits and pieces. And it was consistent and tasty. And the restaurant staff provided us a great service. They handled our large crowd seamlessly. The service was available when ever you need it. And they were very welcoming too. In most of the other places the services usually degrade with crowd but here we didn’t see it. This was the best service we get during our yearly trips so far. Kudos. Keep it up. Though I mentioned about the staff here and there above I felt that they deserve a dedicated section. Overall, I am very impressed by the quality of the service we received from the staff during our stay. Starting from the front desk they were welcoming, helpful and almost always ready for our requests. So far, we never had this smooth check-in anywhere throughout the past years. Just after the trip I mentioned about the quality of service to one of my school friends and he confirmed it. Kudos guys & gals. Though our stay was very short it was very enjoyable thanks to the beautiful hotel and its great staff. Thank you very much. We would love to return in future.",positive
"Yet another beautiful stay with lasting memories,at the Heritance Ahungalla hotel.From the moment we stepped in till the time we stepped out,we were important to them.The warmth of their beautiful smiles remains in our hearts forever. Mr.Thushara and Mr.Nipun,Thank you once again for your commitment,your efforts and the responsibility shown to make our stay worthwhile.We highly appreciate The General manager Mr.Sisira Senarathne,Mr.Thushara , Mr.Nipun,and the whole team at the restaurant,for their genuine interest in making the guests feel so important.We would like to wish you great success,in all your future endeavours.You are a great asset to the company.Thank you so much.",positive

We had a lovely time at this beautiful place.. the bean is really beautiful and very relaxing holiday..our room was excellent and spacious..staff and the service is amazing..we will be back for sure ...,positive
Went for our company trip. CMS. Hotel is very nice as well as the staff. Lunch and breakfast is perfectly. However Saturday night dinner only had few options. We stayed in room 24x. Room had a bad smell. Not sure if it is too much air freshener. However it is a mood killer for us.,positive
"Beautiful place and hotel, although little old. What was annoying was the staff calling us from 11 am to vacate the room, it looks like the operational ease has taken over customer care in this place, despite the fact that we arrived previous night late and had very little time(less than 15 hours), we requested to stay late in one room vacating the other....no concern at all, just a nice smile on the face don’t mean anything if no serious customer centric culture is cultivated! little thought for the GM to think about!",positive
"This was my second visit to your hotel. Good service , front office Ms. sashini is very helpful , thank you so much for your help. Room service also good , thank you very much for your excellent service ROSHINIE",positive
"This was our second visit to you hotel after 10 years. From the time we arrived at the hotel and up to the time of departure, we were taken care of by the staff of the hotel as if we were their family. The service and the courtesy provided by all the staff is unbelievably. We were treated like royalty. The room was spacious and very comfortable and had all the amenities. The toilet was very clean. The food was very tasty and the buffet spread was great, even when the occupancy was less on Sunday night and Monday morning. We only used limited facilities at the hotel such as the swimming pool (both) and gymnasium, which are of very high standard. Overall my family (wife and 2 kids) experienced a very enjoyable and relaxing time at you luxurious hotel. We will definitely visit your hotel again in the future and recommend the hotel to our friends and family. Thank you ""Team Heritance, Ahungalla"".",positive
"Nice place for a family outing.. Excellent service, good food, and relaxing environment. Staff is really friendly and helpful..Rooms are neat and tidy though sime are but old.. They have got evening entertaintment like magic shows...etc. Night club on saturdays...",positive
"Perfect destination to enjoy a relaxed and cheerful break. Wonderful service and delicious food. @ Shanika, thank you so much for your great service. You made our day here. Absolutely worth the deal to spend the day 👍😁",positive
"This hotel is really nice and just at the lovely beach - the first impression is really wow! Rooms are nice, spacious and cleaned every day - small tips can makes 'miracles':) Service is good, however Staff' English is a little bit poor and you are expected to leave a tip for everything. Sellers are around the hotel but also managing to get into hotel area trying to sell trips, goods, etc. That was a bit too much but understand that is their only source of money...The village is poor so not surprising that all tuk tuk drivers are waiting outside the hotel to offer you a trip, lift, whatever just to make some money - of course they will give you 5 times higher price so dont take any offer until negotiate and agreed the price before you get into tuk tuk - they can be a bit aggressive too. The only one we can recommend is Kamal - blue tuk tuk. When you walking along the main street, there will be plenty tuk tuk stopping and urge you go with them, so you need to be assertive and patient at the same time. When you go to the local shop they will also try to offer you a trip, tuk tuk etc. of course few times more expensive but you dont know the prices so they take an advantage on you. My advise dont buy any trip, arrange for tuk tuk ntil you check few offers. We got riped off on the 1st day terribly, but i guess we let that to happened too. We were using also public transport to travel around - blue buses are crazy I mean the drivers, its like rally really... but very cheap 35 rp to Bentotta, or same distance, 100 to Galle. Red buses (national bus services) are even cheaper. Beaches are lovely, but there is also plenty rubbish which is really sad. Tsunami damages are still visible - its worth to visit the museum and pay respect to all victims. Mind Moon stone mines trips - the prices are cosmic and you will be nothing but pushed to buy something - we had very bad experience with that. Its better to go to the recommended shop (i seen quite few on TA, however only checked them after not prior to going to the moon stone mine). As for the Hotel, the food is good, but pretty much repeatable, mainly orientated on meat eaters, as a Vegetarian or Vegan you have very limited options (dhal curry - was my everyday meal :) There is entertainment every night, but there was not many people attending, so was a bit lonesome. Except for the culture show (inc. fire eaters!) in the garden during dinner - just amazing! Only on the second last day of our stay we found out there was a night club - nothing great but would be nice if there are any directions signs or at least sign above the entrance. In general the hotel is nice, but a bit like a prison when you go outside the gate Good but not excellent. if we go to Sri Lanka again I would prefer staying in many places as travel across the island",positive
"This is our first time in this lovely hotel and we enjoyed food, and pool with our kids. Both pools are huge and very nice. Our room was so large and it was very comfortable for my family with the kids. Thank you for the great hospitality.",positive
"We had a really nice time with my kids and family, food is yummy and the huge room is perfect for a family. The two pools are cool. We can recommend this lovely place to everyone and hope to see you all soon.",positive
Very friendly and helpful staff... rooms are little bit old and tried... need to be updated.. but the hotel is very beautiful.. swimming pools are amazing... specially the green with with the Jacuzzi...,positive
beautiful place to relax and enjoy....we had a lovely room with a nice sea view.. staff is very friendly and helpful.. Also the food and rhe service is fabulous... thank you for the great hospitality.. we will come back again....,positive
"This hotel is beautiful and our stay was quite enjoyable. The rooms were such a relief after days of hostels and camping, the staff are very helpful and the beach is lovely. The entrance is perhaps misleading in how luxurious the rest of the hotel really is, but it isn't an issue.",positive
"We have always wanted to stay at this hotel and this was the first time we had an opportunity. We stayed recently for a few days whilst visiting Sri Lanka. The hotel really needs to be updated, compared to other beach hotels this hotel stands out for being old and dated. Not a good place to be. The rooms are a good size and comfortable but everything needs to be modernised. The food was quite nice and really enjoyed our dinner and breakfast. The hotel is overlooking the sea and the views are great. Both swimming pools are really big and very conveniently placed. The staff make up for the disappointing look of the hotel. They are extremely nice and helpful. They really made our stay and amazing one. The price paid £ 155-160/- per night per room is really not a fair price for this hotel. Hence will not return.",negative
Heritance ahungalla is one of our favourite hotels where we can relax and enjoy the holiday ...the room was excellent withtwo big beds ..bathroom is very clean..we will come back again yo this beautiful place,positive
"Another Inheritance hotel designed by Geoffrey Bawa but this one, unlike Kandalama, is brutishly concrete and a bit worn. Service and restaurant quality are also jaded. Room and bathroom very good.This is a luxury hotel struggling to hold a 4-star rating. Located on the beach, it has two quality pools and nice grounds. The entrance to the hotel is more impressive than what waits behind. Criticism is intended to be mild because this place is ok, just not up to the best Sri Lanka can offer.",positive
"We have just returned from a fabulous 2 week honeymoon in Sri Lanka. We had stayed in 3 fab places before our final stop at The Heritance. From looking at the website and booking the holiday through a luxury travel agent, it looked like it was going to be a lovely retreat to relax in for 5 days. Unfortunately this wasn’t quite the case... I had e-mailed and Facebook messaged the hotel the day before arrival. I asked whether they had any suites or some of their best rooms available to upgrade to, as we were on our honeymoon and wished for something extra special. The responded via Facebook asking for my e-mail address so that they could forward information on. I responded and I didn’t get anything back. I then e-mailed them directly-nothing back again!! Nothing was said on check in...no special greeting...nothing. We were taken to our room, I told the lady taking us there that I had e-mailed and wanted to make sure we got a sea view. She was quite dismissive. When we got to our room, it was ground floor level taking us straight out to the pool. You could hear the sea, but defiantly couldn’t see it. The room was pleasant enough-modern with a big bed but definatly not 5 star. There was a congratulations cake on the table to great us (we had one at most places we stayed to be honest). But that was the only thing we got to feel special. No one asked whether we would like to organise a special dinner etc etc. As the cake was so big, it was going to take us several days to eat it. Housekeeping could have taken it away and put it in the fridge, but instead it was left out on the side to attract ants. We were just overall a bit disappointed...it was defiantly more of a family hotel and there were kids everywhere the whole weekend we were there and breakfast was crazy-we thought that the hotel was opening up the restaurant and pool to non residents at the weekend. The restaurant needs a facelift for sure as it again did not feel like 5* dining. At breakfast we always waited patiently to be seated, once seated the waitress or waiter would hurry off without asking whether we would like tea or coffee. I then had to try and grab someone’s attention again so it basically took 15 minutes to get a hot drink. A little poor for 5*. We had lunch via room service a couple of days and that was pleasant enough-very little choice but if you like chips and sandwiches then it’s fine. They had no samosas and very few of the wines on the extensive wine list on show. I had to chose 3 different wines before finally getting the 4th one I asked for. Also if you like cocktails, you will be disappointed as the ones I had at the hotel were not very nice. We only ate dinner in the restaurant once during our 5 night stop, as we decided we would get better service and food elsewhere. The fine dining restaurant had no people in on any of the nights we were there and we just couldn’t think of anything worse than the madness of that buffet restaurant again. Where the staff were in attentive and miserable. Sorry Heritance but we just expected more I’m sorry. And to top it all off we got a phone call the morning of check-out just to make sure we were checking out on time or if we had booked a late check out. And a bill pushed through the door the night before. Come on...it was low season, hotel was not busy at all and we were on our honeymoon. Every morning we were woken at 5am by noisy people checking out of their rooms or walking in high heels right above our bedroom. With being on the ground floor, we were right on the main drag for people moving around. If we had been higher up with a lovely sea view, then we would have hopefully had some peace and quiet.",negative
This is my 2nd time at the hotel. We were allocated a spacious room. The hotel was at full capacity. The F& B managers were very good and helpful. The rooms were clean but I felt the housekeeping service lacked quite a bit. There was a cultural show and many kids activities. On the downside I was a little annoyed when the hotel had left a letter under my door reminding me about our check out for the next day. I had paid in full for both days and I feel such a reminder was not required. A family friendly hotel overall.,positive
This is our second visit to the Heritance Ahungalla. Excellent place for a vacation over the beach. Great hospitality. Very friendly staff and very helpful. Luxurious and comfortable rooms with all the amenities. Two beautiful large pools with nice surrounding. Very clean hotel. Good food with lots of choices and variations. My two kids were enjoyed a lot. Both were very very sad at the time of checkout. Hope to visit again.,positive
We had a very relaxing time with my family. We enjoy our stat a lot. Food and service is great. The two pools near by beach are amazing in this beautiful place. We will come back soon and thanks for the great hospitality.,positive
We had a great time with our friends. Food is so tasty and pool is very nice to relax with friends. This place is situated in a great location nectar to the beach. We will recommend to anyone this beautiful place.,positive

We had a great time with my friends in this amazing hotel.We want to come back again to have a great time.Thanks for the great hospitality. We will recommend this place to anyone who wants to relax and enjoy.,positive
The hotel ous located in a nice location. Very good architecture. Rooms are fairly good in space and clean. Natural trees are used up to the maximum to create a good atmosphere. Food is also good. I like the service level and staff also.,positive
"The room is excellent and is based on the European Standard or the American standard with local design. We like it a lot. The sea view is great and very nice. The room service is terrific! Rukmal, Our roomboy was always very polite and striving for our well-being. Great praise for that! The hotel should promote his carierre, a better guest service I have not seen yet. There are many roomboys in the world who can learn from him. The food is very varied and good, you always find something delicious. We enjoyed the massage at the spa, the pool are fantastic. But we have a point of criticism. The Beach Boys are, in part, very intrusive and run behind you at the beach. We made a tour with one of the Beach Boys, his name is Rasil you can find him on the beach entrace. The trip was quite good, but for 20€ per person it was effectivly not sooo cheap -as they say- for a 4h trip to the next Village. But live and let live. What we didn't like was the trip to the herbal garden on same day and trip. This is all about selling scrap for a lot of money. It feels like mafia. Also the women's at beach before the hotel which are selling clothes are annoying. You have no chance to go to the beach undisturbed. We know they want to secure their livelihood, but more privacy would be great, then I‘d probably buy something. All in all the hotel is great, the service excellent (thank you very much Rukmal!) and the hotel area are well maintained. We'd recommend the hotel.",positive
we had an amaxing stay at this beautiful place . staff is very friendly and helpful.. food is excellent . we will come back for sure and will recommend to our other friends as well. thank you for the great hospitality .,positive
The definition of the word Rare and explosions of flavour in the mouth. Just WOW.....

Excellent place for a vacation over the beach. Beach is very large and clean with great views. Two beautiful large pools with nice surrounding. Had some issues when check-in but overall friendly staff. Luxurious and comfortable rooms with all the amenities. Good food with lots of choices and variations.,positive
"It was the annual trip of our office. Upon arrival my first impression wasn't so good because of the old look of the hotel. But inside was nice and staff was helpful. It was a group of 13 people but they sorted out rooms quickly and handed over the keys. Finding the rooms is a bit of a problem as there were no signs for room number ranges. Had to ask 3 people for directions. Spacious rooms and well lit. Washroom was clean and no bad smell came out. There's 2 pools. One right at the lobby and the other one close by. The pool near the lobby dint had a Jacuzzi but the other one had. There was 2 of them but only one was functional. And there's a pool table in the 1st floor. And also they have a spa and a gym. on those 2 days the hotel was fully booked and crowded. But at the dinner, there was very calm and quiet environment. I don't know how they managed it but its very nice of them to have dinner with friends in a noise free place. Food is great (overall). Vast variety and there's everything. Have to mention the staff is very nice and descent. Works quickly and really appreciate that. I would definitely visit this place again. Recommended for anyone for a good holiday.",positive
I was there with my parents when I came on a holiday from the UK.Excellent place for a relaxing holiday with an amazing view of the sea. Great and very friendly staff and they were happy to help at anytime. Spacious and luxurious rooms with all the facilities. Food was amazing and there were lots of choices and it was exceptional. My special thanks goes to miss Dilinie Rajapaksha who gave us a tremendous support when I booked the hotel. There were two beautiful pools and the surrounding of the hotel was exceptional. I highly recommend this hotel and I’ll definitely visit this place during my next holiday from England.,positive
"It's clean and staff is good. For the food, it's same as all hotels..not that sooooo good...but not that bad even.....if you want to have bacon for the breakfast, you will get only 2pcs for a person..😕😕😕. They make hoppers, rotty, and some few items on the spot. So that's good. Tastes wise you can be some happy..don't keep any high expectations. Hotel rooms are clean..and pools ( there are 2 pools, one pool is given for foreigners for there relaxation) clean..there are no any bad things to say about this one. It's a good hotel..but for the price..hmmmm....I'm still thinking about that..🤔",neutral
"When we first arrived we were welcomed by the staff and an amazing view! During our stay all of the staff have been very helpful and accomodating. They have ensured our honeymoon stay was as perfect as could be. Our room was cleaned to a very high standard on a daily basis and we were left with towel decor everyday made by Rukmal. Rukmal is always smiling, he is very friendly and takes pride in his job. On to the food!!!! What can i say, it was absolutely amazing! There was a variety of food everyday and the food was fresh and delicious! Both chefs, DJ. Manjula & Praveen Fernando were phenomenal. Everyday they made sure we ate to our hearts content and even made us our own dishes at request. Other staff we would like to thank are Danuka Madusanka & Himasha Wijesooriya as they both were always very polite & provided a high quality customer service. Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Heritance Ahungalla and would like to thank everyone who made it a special experience. Shana & Robert room 354",positive
"Having visited Heritance Ahungalla a number of times all experiences have been exceptional! The hotel comes with two pools, one close to the reception and the other close to the rooms surrounded by trees (my favorite pool to chill at) and an outdoor Jacuzzi by the side of the pool. The rooms are really spacious with balconies facing the sea side, also provided with all amenities. Super convenient that each room is also provided with 2 pairs of slippers, in case you forget to bring your own. The food range is amazing, covering from many Sri Lankan delicacies to Continental food items and my personal favorite item - sushi! Probably not so authentic when it comes to the selection of Sushi as size is sometimes too big for a bite size and also too heavy on rice. The service has been decent enough with friendly and attentive staff from the front office staff to the restaurant staff to all the other staff. There’s a bit of a hassle from beach side vendors trying to sell you things and offer you boat rides when you take a walk to the beach, so there’s not much of privacy. There were several times when these vendors mistook us Sri Lankans to be foreigners and rip us off for boat rides, so be aware if you want to take the rides and how much you pay them. The hotel also offers a well equipped gym, a cozy library with many books and a carom board along with a billiard table for in-house entertainment other than the cultural shows hosted at nights. Overall Heritance Ahungalla is a fantastic hotel by the beautiful southern coast of Sri Lanka, less than an hour and a half’s drive from Colombo and in close proximity to Galle and Galle fort that offers such interesting adventures.",positive
"We went to Heritance Ahungalla to celebrate our anniversary and travelled as a family. We selected Heritance as it was by Geoffrey Bawa whose architecture my son loves. And we were not disappointed. The architecture was amazing - simple lines, wide open spaces that blend with nature.... From the moment we stepped in to the hotel, everything was perfect. The view that greets you is amazing! The rooms were excellent and the food delicious.. From the welcome until we checked out the service was fantastic, the staff friendly and accommodating. They all went out of the way to make our special day a truly memorable one. A special thank you from us to all the staff members who went out of their way to make our anniversary a day to remember. Looking forward to another visit!",positive
"We walked in to hotel for the buffet, it wasn’t available but the hotel management decided to give us their best service they can. Honestly one of the best hotel staff and management in srilanka, food was extremely delicious. Keep up your hospitality we’ll visit again soon.",positive
Its was my first time ever at heritence n the welcome at the entrance was spectacular even though the occupancy was extremely high which is a lesson to many hotels on the island ..the rooms were clean n massive n the service was the quickest n most commendable..very positive n friendly staff n no discrimination between foreigners n locals.. The buffets had a great variety with sri lankan to western cuisines..the area is massive with 2pools n variety of events..there is abclub with a dj on saturday night n a band at the lobby which takes u back to 80 s..i m looking forward to visit again..worth the money u pay..,positive
"We went for our anniversary and absolutely loved it. The hotel has a old-scl charm and vibe with 2 pools and alot of space to explore. The food was very good, though the rooms were smaller in size, it was an overall great experience. The staff was very friendly and food action stations were well rounded! Recommended!",positive
"The best hotel in Bentota at absolutely fantastic location. The hotel is bang on the beach. I went there to unwind and absolutely got what I wanted. We were welcomed very fondly at arrival and asked to relax at reception while completing check-in formalities along with varities of welcome drinks. From the reception itself you will appreciate your decision of choosing this property for vacation. Rooms are spacious and clean. Property is big enough offering various activities such as two big pools, jacuzzi, table tennis, lawn tennis court...etc. Caferteria is big enough and offers variety of rich and tasty food, I loved they asked and served my favorite dish at the dinner, and I found that the best around. The staff is very courteous and shows empathy towards guests needs without wasting a minute. I enjoyed sri-lankan cocktails at bar. I also enjoyed various cultural shows every night arranged by the hotel. Looking at so many things, you can pretty much stay in the hotel all day without getting bored.",positive
The hotel is apparently 35years old and the location is absolutely fantastic. The hotel is bang on the beach. Unfortunately the beach is not a swimmable one during this time of the year. The room allocated to me was in the residents wing. At least that's what I believe it was called. Very quite and peaceful place. I went there to unwind and absolutely got what I wanted. Was welcomed very fondly at arrival and my room was also ready. The front office team was kind enough to give an hour's late check out.,positive
My home town is balapitiya and im 3 km away from heritance ahungalla. I have been to most of the hotels in sri lanka and the only one hotel in sri lanka can matched the quality of this and its heritance kandalama,positive
"The hospitality starts from the 1st step into the hotel; warm welcome with traditional variety of fresh juices. Front desk was very helpful and friendly. Once they saw the kids, they were informing the parents about the events organized for the kids on that day. They had magic show and chef programs for kids during our stay. The room was clean. Food was amazing at the restaurant and all staff were very helpful. In the night, they had local live music. This hotel has 2 pools; The green pool with Jacuzzi and trees around is my choice and it is the best. They also have plenty of indoor and outdoor sports.",positive
"Loved the stay ! Stayed in the suite and the property welcomed us with Champagne 🥂. The suite was huge and very well appointed. The service overall was splendid! Highly recommend and if you happen to be choosing to stay in the suite , it’s totally worth it👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻",positive
"It was a very nice stay in the Heritance. All was very nice, like the food, the people where you can ask every time and especially our cleaning boy for our nice room. The name of our cleaning boy is Rukmal and he made a wonderful Job ervey day, like nice figueres on the bed. We enjoyed our Trip and we will recommend the Heritance Hotel.",positive
"Amazing first day at the Heritance ahungalla. Great suite 262, good food and courteous service. The rooms are cleaned twice by courteous staff. The restaurant staff are very friendly and quick. The wide variety of food is tasty and fresh. Overall a great place for a relaxed holiday. A separate pool for residents makes it less crowded and enjoyable.",positive
"Heritance Ahungalla is a great place to relax and enjoy with your family, they got a bunch of very friendly staff who are very hospitable, food was awesome n got breathtaking surroundings. We can’t forget our fantastic housekeeping person RUKMAL for his great work, especially for making our little four year old munchkin happy with all the little things ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Thanks Heritance Ahungalla",positive
The hotel is very beautiful. The people are very nice and friendly. The pool is hudge and there is also a little whirlpool to chill in. The rooms are always clean and Rukmal our housekeeper always made wonderful decorations on our bed.,positive
"Excellent Location, Amazing Architecture by Geoffrey Bawa. Nice View from the rooms facing the Indian Ocean. Two nice swimming pools, one with two Jacuzzis.

Heritance Ahungalla is a beautiful hotel in a lovely location. The staff is helpful and courteous and service overall is exemplary. The food is heavenly and an extensive selection is available at buffets. We visit the hotel at least twice a year and intend to keep on visiting.,positive
I stayed for one day and a half.The hotel was in very good quality. All facilities were in easy to find places. The food had amazing taste but it could be better if there was more variety in food as there were very little meat. Otherwise and amazing play to play. There was man who always called everyone for sport activities this allowed me to try new sports and activities which was an amazing thing. Thank you so much for the such a quality stay and service. Will never forget this stay.,positive
Very relaxing hotel with lovely people... both pools are amazing... food and service is excellent... my sister had a lovely room with a nice view.we will be back again to visit this lovely place.thank you...,positive
Basically ome of my favourite getaway hotels to have a good time with really good food. Service is incredible and staff is amazingly friendly. What can I say except the fact that if you are planning a visit to Sri Lanka this is the place to stay at.,positive
"A Weekend getaway with the extended family. Great location but the hotel is dated, and overdue for a major overhaul. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The washroom unfortunately small,and gloomy. Great Band on Saturday night! Thank you Praveen Fernando, Chef Skanda Wickramasuriya, Kenny at reception, Wasitha De Silva, and the rest of the team for the great service. We had an enjoyable time. Special mention of Uthpala Abeysekara at the head office Colombo, who went out of her to make our trip special. Excellent PR skills. Thank you Uthpala.",positive
"This year we choose Heritance Ahungalla as the destination of our office trip. We stayed 9 and 10th June there on full board basis. We had a head count of about 50 people and the hotel treated us well. I must say that the breakfast, lunch and dinner buffets were all good and was up to good standards, the buffet had considerable variety and the staff and their families enjoyed it. The rooms too were very comfortable and none of us observed any issues with the facilities in the rooms. The hotel staff were also very helpful and attended to our needs and assisted in the evening events and gatherings. The view of the beach from the hotel is also very good and calming, I greatly enjoyed the morning sun bath and the walk down the beach. The hotel had two great pools and a Jacuzzi which we enjoyed. Based on our stay I recommend this as a great hotel.",positive
"Perfect Hotel! Very great and polite staff! The service is perfect, you will feel like King and Queen Special Thanks to Rukmal, our room was every day an event.... see the pictures... definitely the best Roomboy ever!!!!!",positive

My special thanks to chef Skanda Wickramasuriya for his effort in satisfying different group of people..I’ll definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to escape from hectic city life.,positive
"We went on a long overdue family holiday to Sri Lanka and stayed at Heritance Ahungulla. Being our first trip to the island nation, we were keen to stay in a property designed by late Sri Lankan architect Geoffrey Bawa. It was the best decision we made. The hotel is stunning- from the entrance with its water garden to the infinity pool which overlooks the ocean. The hotel staff are wonderfully warm and courteous. A special mention must be made of Mr Rukmal from housekeeping who has the most amazing gift of creating animal shapes out of bath towels. We'd come back to our rooms every day to delightedly find the sweetest elephants, swans and even crocodiles mad out of pristinely white bath towels arranged on our beds! The food is a mixture of Sri Lankan, Continental and Asian. The two swimming pools are a blessing as the beach at Ahungulla is unsafe for swimming. June being off season, meant the hotel was only half full which in turn meant that we had a wonderfully serene holiday. The weather, with only a few bouts of rain, was lovely. Our trip was a wonderful introduction to Sri Lanka. Thank you all at Heritance Ahungulla for making our visit such a wonderful experience!",positive
"We would like to make the world of connoisseurs aware of the treat the 3 of us were witnessing tonight at Ahungalla beach in the Heritance Hotel. Especially Kalinga, Waruna and Danuka thank you so much for making this night so special and attentive. Your service was extraordinary. You not only made us a gorgeous table ready for us you took great care of us recommending to us the menue, lobster and rice, fillet and vegetables and Risotto which was served to us in the most romantic way and 5 star way. And then, by the end of the main course— the rain started to pour on us! And you guys ran towards us protecting us and the cuddly dog with a huge umbrella. Later for coffee and rum and tea we finished the evening with great live music. Thank you soo much. You overachieved by all means.",positive
"I and my family stayed in a suite with great views of the ocean and the beach below, comfy beds with spotless crisp white linen. The bathroom unusually spacious, tastefully designed, with all the amenities one can think of. We being regular dinners at some of the well known restaurants in Colombo, assert, that the food is of high quality, fresh and Very tasty .A fine balance,of the East and West . Restaurant Manager Rasika , and Praveen, and Thushara of his team , will ensure that you have the perfect dining experience, while periodically going up to the guests, to inquire . Nipun can make anything happen, in and out of the restaurant . Randeepa and Sanduli was very attentive, cautious and super friendly and wanted to feed us more and more ! And Charming Nadika after a day, knew exactly what to serve, and also a specialist in “ water on the rocks ! And of course our star, the versatile singing chef, Skanda, who will rock the restaurant depending on his mood, apart from devising the delicacies for the dinners. The Human touch makes this hotel very special. The unpararel feature of this hotel is, the members of the management staring in their self- choreographed drama to entertain the guests, bringing absolute laughter ! This brought a sense of togetherness; the guests and the staff…….a fine way to bring the evening to its end. What was special again was that the check out was as warm , as the welcome at check in. And Nipun was always there ! The hotel was full , and perhaps this may be the only hotel, where the Front Manager Srinath , busy schedule, was loading the baggage of the guests to the vehicle, along with the staff ! Heritance Ahungalla is unique ! An experience not to be missed, when in Sri Lanka ! I and my family wish to thank everyone in this lovely hotel , who make our stay unforgettable ! Executive chef Chaluka Rodrigo and General Manager Sisira Senarathne, WELL DONE ! Senadhi.",positive

Ha This was our first visit to this amazing hotel. It was low season but still seemed full I met some wonderful staff who were very helpful and made our stay comfortable and memorable A huge shout out to the guest relations officer Himasha she had the most beautiful cheerful smile everyday for us making sure we had everything we needed Nirosh from Bachus Bar was cheerful and served me the best passion fruit drink Nipon who was the food and beverage executive made sure our bellies were constantly full with some of the most delicious food. Manjula whipped us up a fantastic banana fritter and ice cream even though it wasn’t on the menu. That was to die for. Dharshana been the Restuarants captain was always making sure we had everything we wanted and more We had the pleasure of meeting Chaluka Rodrigo who is the executive chef who had whipped up our delicious dinner Jananjaya Restuarants captain was always making sure we were well taken care of. I cannot express my joy in finding this place and spending 4 nights here. Close to the ocean Beautiful pools spaciously located with beautiful greenery Perfect for couples and families I cannot praise all the staff enough for all the great service. A huge thank you and a memorable one as we celebrated our anniversary here,positive
A piece of Geoffrey Bawa architecture in Ahungalla nice place to relax as beach and pool stay. meals are awesome also seafood dinner always yammy yammy. near miss this place if you finding something without a rush city.,positive
"""WOW"".. the exact words I said out loud as I walked into the reception lobby of Heritance Ahungalla. It is a Majestic beach hotel with outstanding services and facilities. I couldn't have asked for anything more. I mean I would say you would be "" living the life"" if you spend a good 3-4 days here. An exquisite room with state of the art furniture and a cozy touch to it with the balcony overlooking the pool and beach.The swift sounds of the water hitting the sand makes it so soothing. The best part is that you can end a perfectly spent relaxing day at this hotel by taking a nice walk by the beach in the night and probably get a chance to see some shooting stars if you get lucky. All the staff members are extremely caring and friendly. You can experience fine dining here with a vast spread to choose from. Now since my family and I are vegetarians, chef D.J.MANJULA and chek SKANDA personally attended to us and took us through a rich culinary experience with a special veg menu crafted just for us which made our stay even more pleasant. A huge thank you to both the chefs and the entire team for doing such a great job and making sure that all your guests leave with a big fat smile because we sure did. Thank you Heritance",positive
"This is an amazing resort in the south part of Sri Lanka. Friendly staff, great service, great food, clean rooms, beautiful beach and pool. Loved our stay at this resort. We were very happy. It was very relaxing to hang out by the pool and see the ocean waves.",positive

"My Family checked in to this Glorious Hotel for a Wedding Function. Function was brilliantly organized from the beginning! The function hall was eye catchingly decorated. The most important thing was that this function did not disturb the residential guests. The Food was Scrumptious! Chef SKANDA WICKRAMASURIYA & his team had done a Marvelous job I must say! The service was Outstanding! Under the guidance of Mr. PRAVEEN, the Service Team performed magnificently. SHEHAN, LALITH, CHAMILA, CHAMITH & NADEEKÀ had done a Marvelous job to delight the guests. They were all smiles & incredibly pleasant while serving us! They should be recognized & encouraged! Mr. PRAVEEN was always there delighting the guests & their needs. I remember him from my previous visits to this Lovely Resort. He is a Real GEM for the HERITANCE Hotels Group. Thank You Heritance Ahungalla for an Absolutely Wonderful Experience!",positive
From start to end it was an awesome experience. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Special thanks for the front desk. They were very helpful and poters has a very good idea of the places to visit. Restaurant staff is also very helpful and friendly. Food is awesome and carries the traditional touch of lanka. Hotel has two pools and both are clean and enough size for a big crowd. Thank you for the grate experience and we expect to return soon.,positive
An interesting sea view.Lovely place with best hospitality. Had a lovely day out that was reasonable priced inside the restaurant and very good buffet was included.Hope to visit again & again.:-) :-) :-),positive
We had a very nice day out that was reasonably priced in the restaurant and a very good buffet was included. The rooms were clean and comfortable. Had an excellent stay and I'm highly Recommending ♥️♥️,positive
"As soon as we arrived we were welcomed warmly and a traditional way. Front desk was very helpful and friendly, even though the lobby was busy all staff had a smile on their faces. Checking was done fast enough and we were taken to our rooms. We got two room's next to each other as we requested it had a very lovely view. Clean rooms with a little touch of antique designs was perfectly done by the housekeeping. Food was amazing at the restaurant and all staff were very helpful. Thankyou for all the support. And I highly Recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to spend some time in Ahungalla area.",positive
"Good location.. The sea is rough for a sea swim. However, They have two pools to compensate for that :P and a wide beach with a lovely relaxing view. This is the second time I visited this place after a long time. The place has evolved. I noticed that in the evenings they had local cultural dances and events to keep the guests entertained. Even the dinner area they had unique local live music which was very relaxing and soothing. The hotel is lovely with friendly staff. Also they had an area with dining close to the beach in the open area with lamp lit dinner.. it was a sight to see and im sure would have felt good for the ones who enjoyed. They have a spa which was super good. They have the authentic Bali massages from the Bali nationals which was super relaxing and value for money. The food was great. Buffet is served on all three meals. The service can be better, in terms of clearing the tables in time. The only negative experience i had was that the stopper in the batch tub in my room was missing. I had to call thrice and wait for 2hrs until they got it fixed. The bad experience spoilt it a bit. But still overall i would not hesitate to visit the hotel again.",positive
"Last weekend, we spent 2 night at this beautiful hotel. Situated in a beautiful place where you can go to the beach within seconds. Staff is very friendly and helpful. The room was clean and well arranged and spacious. Most of the rooms were overlooking the beach and in the evening, you can witness a beautiful sunset. Two pools are there. Infinity and Resident. I loved both of them. At the main pool, there is a bar so you dont have to go somewhere else to have a drink. Foods selection is good. Well thought about different types of tourists.Sometimes waiters get busy with the people and they tend to forget to clean the tables and dishes. If they can focus on it, I must say this is one of the best hotels you can come across in Galle District.",positive
"we spent 1 night full board at this really good hotel over the weekend. i highly recommend this hotel for couples, family and friends. the staff is very friendly and courteous..always with a smile. the rooms are over looking the beach and very nice. the bathrooms i felt needed a upgrade and a good clean..not a deal breaker..!!. the bed was very comfortable with plenty of pillows for 2. i wish the TV was bigger and the movie channels were better... the meals were superb..maybe not to everyone's liking since my wife thought some of the dishes were tasting bland... parking is available at the property. i recommend using the valet. overall i highly recommend this hotel...will defiantly come back maybe this time stay for 2 nights.",positive
"I must say that this is an exemplary fairyland! It dissolves all sorrows and pains when entering to the lobby.This amazing view got us for another paradise along with the warm and unique welcome. Food was awesome and hats off for all the staff! Service rendered by a well trained staff and they are absolutely courteous. Two swimming pools add the serenity but love the Green pool a lot. Direct access to the beach is perfect. Special thanks to Mr. Sisira, Mr. Rasika & his marvelous F&B team, Chef Skanda, Mr. Lakshitha & whole Front Office team. Thank you all for your amazing service which can not beat for another.",positive
"We recently stayed here for two weeks and have to say had a great time. The hotel and grounds are lovely. It is right on the beach front which is beautiful. I can only comment on the room we had which was a deluxe room with partial sea view. The only reason it states partial is because there are palm trees and bushes between the room and view but it was lovely all the same. The room was spacious and had everything we needed. Lovely basket of fruit on arrival which was refreshed in the second week. Bottled water Daily and a mini fridge full of soft drinks, alcohol, crisps and chocolate. Rooms were cleaned daily and beds turned down each night, fresh towels twice a day. Lovely towel art left each day. The room cleaners really are a credit to the hotel. Although I have to say all the staff are a credit. All very helpful and pleased to help. Food was amazing. We were on an all inclusive basis which we wouldn’t normally do but would recommend as not much nearby outside of the hotel. Great selection of meals all day. Have to say we were in curry heaven. Good selection for non curry eaters! Many reviews say Diet Coke isn’t included in your drinks package which concerned me being diabetic, however they actually have Coke Zero which is included. Wine is only served at meal times in the A.I. Package. Two great pools in the grounds, we spent our time by the quiet pool. Bars were good but we spent most of our time at the pool bar were most of the entertainment was in the evenings. Some of the shows a bit bizarre but that’s A.I. for you. The days spent on the sun beds were filled with sightings of monitor lizards, chipmunk type creatures and monkeys roaming the grounds. Whilst here make sure you get out and about there is so much to see. We used a local guide who was a fraction of the price of tui who we travelled with. Found him prior to going and booked all our trips via him before going, didn’t require payment until we arrived and met him personally.There are lots of local guides inc ones on the beach and the money stays local. *** Try Charu of czarek tours *** you can find him on Facebook or at charukadesilva5@gmail.com Also don’t listen to tui when they say you have to use your rupees up before the airport or exchange what you have left in the departure lounge prior to going through security. You can spend them in the airport!! Finally we would like to thank all the staff at the Heritance for making our holiday so special. I would certainly stay here again if we return.",positive
It was an amazing stay with my husband in this beautiful and luxury resort in Ahungalla. Rooms were well organized with everything we need. we had tea/coffee making facilities and they had Wi-Fi. A king sized bed and all. Rooms were clean. Food was so yummy. Stay on Half board basis. Don't miss their dinner. You can visit few nearby places like Turtle Hatchery etc. Galle is not close. Few hours drive. But Ahungalla is a good location too. No need to go to Galle again. This is close to the beach and you can go to beach as well. I would definitely go again and pamper myself.,positive
Very much like the hotel . Special happy about the service given by . Name call Amila . Beyond the expectations. Keep up the good work! Thank you ! Can recommend to others too . And great music given by dinner time . Very talented singers,positive
We had a really great time! The hotel staff were very helpful and they provided us with everything we wanted! We really had a great time.. we at the luxury room and I would say we got the luxury service too.. the buffet was excellent! All three meals the food was yummy!! Really loved my stay! Would recommend anyone to stay there!!,positive
Very good stay This is our 5th visit. When we want a break from our busy life we always end up at Heritance. Very good atmosphere. The food is great. I love this place . The friendly staff. And usually when the check out time comes they don't call and give reminders. And it's upto us to be ethical in vacating the room. This is what I like in them. I feel it's like my second day home,positive
Buffet offers verity of dishes including Sri Lankan meals. Suit was nicely arranged with space and cleaned. Met friendly staff whose always keeping the smile on the faces. Recommended for leasure purposes.,positive
"We had the best time in our lives,this year too,at this heavenly place,where those loving, smiley faces,worked so hard to serve the best and make each and every moment of our holiday extra special.We were super lucky to be part of your Staff Avurudu event,as that was extremely entertaining,and worth watching.Every visit refills our minds with fresh beautiful memories of the Heritance Ahungalla family.We would like to thank specially the restaurant and the bar manager mr.Thushara,and the food and beverages executive,Mr.Nipun,who have been offering a valuable service for us,on our every visit to Heritance Ahungalla.The whole team made our stay fabulous,once again.The warm welcome offered by the general manager,is highly appreciated.Exceptionally cleaned rooms,delicious food,relaxing surrounding,superb entertainment and unmatchable hospitality.There was nothing we could ask for more.Thank you so much,once again.You guys are the best.",positive
"Excellent place to visit. People on the hotel were very friendly and they given a good service. I will recommend anyone for that hotel for stay on down south in Sri Lanka. Fantastic service, amazing food...",positive
"Stayed at this wonderful hotel, and all I could say is we had a unforgettable stay experience. It started from the moment we entered the hotel, Wonderfull staff with genuine smile all around. what agreat view of the sea, sand and sun ! Very clean hotel with tastefully arranged lobby and guest rooms. Quality food and pristine beach is definitely add. If you are looking for a hotel on the beach, I have no hesitation of recommending this wonderful hotel. Good luck and thank you to all at Heritance",positive
"Not really one for wiring reviews but let me tell you,this hotel is nothing short of exceptional. Fantastic service, amazing food, beautiful architecture inspired by tropical modernism, all finished off with a beautiful view of the Indian Ocean.",positive
"I returned to Heritance Ahungalla after several years to relive my memories from the last trip which was excellent. This time however the hotel fell way short in meeting my expectations. It all started with a 45 minute waiting time just to get checked in. The lobby was storming with guests and baggage scattered everywhere reminded me of a government hospital than a star class hotel. The room was very clean and neat however, I had booked myself in to a ""Deluxe King"" room with a ""King Size"" bed on the ground floor (printed on the confirmation). However I had been given a room on the 1st floor with two single beds put together. We were so eager to get to the beach that the minute we came to the room we unpacked and stormed off to the beach. It was when we returned we figured out that it was not a king size bed. Called and complained to the concierge and I was told that ""Sir, you have to make a special request for a king size bed at the time of booking if you needed one"". After 15 minutes of arguing and speaking to the duty manager was I offered to be shifted to another room. Again, a very clean and comfortable room but a small shower in a very odd triangular shape. Not for someone who is claustrophobic. We went for dinner in the main restaurant and it was chock-a-block. They had stuffed every available chair and table in to it and we could only move about sideways. The seemed to have a shortage of plates as we had to wait up to 5 minutes sometimes for fresh clean plates. And no service what so ever. There were only five or six waiting staff to serve and we hardly caught a glimpse of them. We were never even offered water. And I am still waiting for the tea I ordered to the table on the second morning of my visit. Dinner was really good. There was a very decent variety of food and the taste was very good. But breakfast was not so exciting. There was no variance and every day it was pretty much the same assortment. In-room dinning was an absolute disaster. It felt as if ""In-room dinning"" is a whole new concept that the hotel staff is yet to hear about. There was no menu available in the room and two cheaply printed A4 sheets stapled together arrived at the door 30 minutes when we called and asked for one. We ordered two fried rice and let me tell you that I have had better fried rice served on a plane. It was a mixture of rice and boiled chicken with the odd piece of carrot. The hotel is beautiful, comfortable and very clean. As long as you lower your exceptions in terms of service, you might have a decent stay. For me however, I do not see myself returning any time soon.",negative
The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. Hotel was bit crowed during my visit. washroom was bit small and outdated also not that clean especially the shower etc. Food was ok and garden and beach was well maintained.,neutral
Rooms - We booked 4 deluxe rooms. Our deluxe room was spacious with music in the room. It was overall good. Two other deluxe rooms were smaller than this a lot but we're new. 1 deluxe room looked very old and was not spacious at all were disappointed to have in 5 star hotel. Bathrooms - Urs was spacious with music and a good showerplace. Other 3 bathrooms were very old and aging. the walls were no tiled as well and only concrete was seen. They were very small as well. Very disappointed. Food - This was a beachside restaurant but the buffet was not good at all. there were very few varieties of food and the only seafood for dinner was fish and prawns. Even the restaurant is too packed and not appealing. Others all good. I rated this according to the room we got and not considering others rooms Here's how I gave rating 1-Room 1-Bathroom 1-Pool 1-Beach and other recreational activities 0-food,negative
"Visited the hotel during the new year holidays with my family. The hotel rooms were good and the food was amazing. The hotel was really crowed because of the news year rates promotions gong on , but the staff at the Hotel worked really hard to give a good customer experience. I will definitely visit this hotel after the rush months and I’m sure it will be a good experience. Keep up the good work guys !",positive
"We stayed two nights during the Sinhala New Year. The hotel staff were very friendly both at the front office and waiter staff. The senior chef went all the way to prepare baby food for our 1.5 year old, that was quite touching. The hotel organised a cultural show as well which was entertaining indeed. The food was excellent, lots of variety both at breakfast, lunch and dinner. The hotel has two pools And a private pool for Inhouse guest. The room we stayed has a beautiful sea view and most rooms do I believe. The only negative thing I can comment is the toilet. It's was very outdated and not that clean especially the shower etc. The time we stayed it rained quite often there weren't much indoor activities at offer in this hotel so you are basically confined to your room. Either way we recommend this hotel to anyone who wish to spend a nice hotel.",positive
"Indeed a great stay to remember. Sri Lanka being the Wonder of Asia is truly gifted to have a place like ""HERITANCE AHUNGALLA"". whether you are a local or a foreigner TEAM HERITANCE AHUNGALLA will treat you with a miracle touch and care which will surely make your holiday an unforgettable experience. Apart from that would like to extend our heart felt gratitude to the hotel staff for their sincere care, friendliness, affection and providing the best services willingly at all times. Special thanks goes to Mr. Thushara, Mr. Praveen,Ms. Sandali and Himasha for the attention they gave when my friend had an injury. It was certainly beyond what we would usually expect . Our best wishes to the special team of this great hotel. Looking forward to visiting this nice place with more family members and friends. Samitha, Sathira and family!",positive
"A really nice place to stay, very clean rooms, very friendly personal. very clean pool. stuff is very helpful, breakfast is not bad. in case i will go back to Sri Lanka i will stay in this hotel again, and i will recommend to my friends!",positive
"Overall, the facilities were nice but we found this property to be poorly managed. 1) Check-in process wasn't organized well. 2 days after check-in, I was contacted and told I had an extra person and I had to pay more money. They didn't even bother understanding their error! We had provided all passports at check-in and we had booked 3 rooms. They had mixed up the adults/kids in the rooms and thought we tried to sneak in an adult at a kid rate. How is that possible if we provided our passports at check-in??? Then at check-out I was still charged and had to get it resolved again. 2) Food was average. And the setup is not optimal. Buffet is split into 2 rooms, with one room having large, open doors which basically let's in bugs/flies. This comes across as unhygienic and dirty. 3) When sitting out by the pool, had to ask 3 times to get towels and ended up getting them ourselves. 4) The room setup isn't good. The bathroom has blinds so it makes it really awkward for someone to use the bathroom. Also, the thermostat directions are on the balcony door (why not next to the thermostat). 5) We arrived on a Wednesday and were excited there would be a show. The show was terrible with what appeared to be some sort of mime type of performance. 6) The gym is a joke! You don't even feel like working out. It's small & cramped with old equipment. 7) There is one elevator that is old and slow.",negative
We travel at least twice a year to Heritance Ahungalla as this is one place we feel very much at home. It was a different experience this time celebrating Sinhala & Tamil New Year (Avurudu). The set up created for the guests to experience a traditional auvurudu ceremony was remarkable. Excellent job done by Mr Sisira Senaratne - GM and his Team. One of the best hotels if you like to spend a few days on the beach peacefully.,positive
"This hotel should learn service and quality from at least Colombo 3 star hotels. The value for the price paid is zero. If there is a refund process, for sure I'll go through that process. It is a shame to Sri Lankan hotel industry.",negative
"This is my fourth visit at this property, amazing customer service from each department, they have gone above and beyond to ensure we had a pleasant stay. Thank you to all the staff. The property is well located , 2 pools and a good spa, perfect to relax and unwind.",positive
"We had two night at this hotel and it certainly did not disappoint in any way. The location at the beach was simply superb, the room was nice, the buffet dinner was fabulous and the buffet breakfast was also great with a wide selection of local and western dishes. The staff were attentive although some were probably in need of a little additional English language exposure.",positive
"I stayed at this hotel from the 19th to the 29th March 2018 and got married on the 28th. These were the best 10 days of my life. With regards to the wedding: I'm from the UK (England) but got married at this hotel on the beach (see picture). Our wedding had 80 guests from the UK - all of which were impressed by this hotel and staff. Guest Relations Manager Himasha Wijesooriya was brilliant. She's kind, professional and made sure me and my wedding guests were happy and relaxed in the days leading up to wedding. She assisted in organising all aspects of the wedding from the legal registration to the decorations, food, drink and party. She was the perfect wedding coordinator. Thank you! Me and all my guests had the most amazing experience! The staff at this hotel treated us like royalty. Food and Beverage Managers Nipun Mawaththa and Mr Prasanna helped coordinate an amazing party with an outstanding buffet and cocktails. Food and Beverage Executive Praveen Fernando also helped tremendously by supporting the events and hosting my family and friends. The polite and dedicated people working at this hotel quickly transformed from staff to friends. The wedding ceremony organised by the hotel was exceptional. We had a beautiful Poruwa ceremony on the beach complete with Kandyan dancers and drummers. Although we out-sourced our wedding and reception decorations from the local town, instead of using the decorations provided by the hotel, the Heritance team coordinated the entire event to perfection. We could not have had a more perfect and enjoyable day. With regards to the hotel: This hotel is perfection. Beautifully designed to see the ocean as soon as you enter with tranquil nature just around every corner in the open-plan corridors. The hotel sits at the bottom of a long driveway so all you can hear are the birds and sea.The rooms are comfortable, clean and decorated beautifully. The swimming pools are brilliant and the Animation Team organised an enjoyable pool-volleyball game for me and my guests. The restaurant food is delicious with plenty of choice from top-quality chefs. One of the defining features of this hotel is by far the location. The Heritance is located so elegantly on one of the most beautiful beaches in the world, Ahungalla beach. You can hear the ocean from the room balcony and late into the evening at the bar. This place is paradise. Thank you so much to all the staff at Heritance Ahungalla. We will be back for sure!",positive
"This hotel is the true mining of a 5 stars resort. Well maintained, impeccable cleaning and courteous staff. The buffet they offered were different every day we stayed and I have not seen this in all hotels of the same caliber. The sous Chef at the restaurant, Skander (I hope I remember well) could not be more spot on walking around, introducing himself on individual basis seeking for feedback and to provide further assistance (like anyone could ask for more than they offer!) but all other restaurant staff was observed frequently interacting with all guests. My child did a silly joke in the pool asking help during swim and the pool supervisor was next to her even before she could finish the sentence (very unpleasant for us but extremely hands on personnel, I can guarantee). My apologies, again. Overall, beautiful place to stay in and incredible family oriented. Thanks for the lovely stay and looking after my family.",positive
"Great stay over April 2018 The property is quite nice, beach front, and the resort has mostly open areas which makes it quite nice. The rooms are quite nice with dark wood and the bathrooms have a nice walk in shower and quite spacious. My room was on the ground floor in front the second smaller pool with a nice terrace which was great as I just walked out of the back doors straight to the pool. Breakfast buffet at the main restaurant is great with a variety of local and western options. Don't miss the egg hoppers, the crud and treacle and the fresh fruit stations. The restaurants have both buffet style and a la carte. Both very good quality and with good options. The Spa is well run and definitely provide a relaxing space. Treatment was done in a very professional way and very relaxing. The beach is great but there are not umbrellas nor chairs available and it looked a bit rough at times. There are some beach vendors walking around and also a few shacks by the beach next to the hotel offering local food. Overall a great place with personality and charm and not pretending to be something that is not. I would definitely come back",positive
"Our stay was from 01st of April to the 02nd of April. As April was a month where a lot of tourists are attracted to Sri Lanka, the hotel did have a lot of guests. But the staff made sure that everyone was treated in a special way. The mastermind behind the architecture of Heritance Ahungalla is Late Geoffrey Bawa and as a result, it’s one of the most striking resorts in the Sri Lankan coast. From the moment where you set foot in the hotel till you leave, the staff stays by your side making sure that your stay is memorable. We experienced a situation which made our visit unforgettable, on the 02nd of April. It was my daughter’s birthday on the 02nd and on the previous day, Mr. Nipun Mawatta happened to know about it from a friendly talk with us. However that simple conversation was enough for him to alert the rest of the staff to surprise my daughter at breakfast on the 02nd by appearing suddenly with a trolley laden with balloons and a birthday cake with the restaurant crew coming together to sing happy birthday as she cut the cake. It was totally an unexpected, well-planned surprise and Mr. Mawatte and the staff deserves a shower of thanks. Not to forget, the food at Heritance was always “never-enough” due to their taste and variety. The rooms were lavish and we highly recommend the rooms with the ocean view as it is truly amazing. The infinity pool is always inviting in the burning heat. During our stay, several gents in the staff decided to display their hidden talents from a hilarious performance after dinner. It kept everyone laughing every time we recalled it. Heritance Ahungalla is one of the greatest places to experience the beauty of the Sri Lankan coast and a place “WHERE TRADITION IS ALIVE”.",positive
"A splendid, well established hotel. Our air-conditioned, en-suite room had generous proportions and was comfotably furnished. We enjoyed a direct view of the Indian Ocean over the trees that lined the wide beach of soft, golden sand. Two pools and extensive gardens with plenty of comfortable loungers provided a relaxing setting. The room attendant maintained a high standard of cleanliness throughout our stay. The flowers arranged over the bed at evening turn-down time was a delightful touch. Service in the bars and restaurants was attentive, courteous and good-humoured. The buffet in the main restaurant was incredibly varied with dishes from around the world. Chefs were always on hand to provide guidance. We also tried one of the al a carte restaurants and found the food superb and very reasonably priced.",positive
"I will start with the positives as they far out way the negatives. This was my 8th visit to Sri Lanka and because the bentota beach was closed for refurb we stayed here for the first time and will return. Positives Arrival - greeted with fresh juices and friendly smiles, check in was smooth and stress free. The reception area was well presented, spacious and had stunning views of the pool. Food - main restaurant food was varied and very tasty, catered for all tastes and the head chef happily cooked us a ""special dish"". Staff in the restaurant were friendly and everything was so clean. Towards the end of our holiday a large Arab family arrived and they were picking up food with their bare hands and putting it back, being hygienic I complained to a floor manager and very quickly the baskets of touched food was quickly removed - I was impressed. The pool snack bars served the most amazing ""fishfingers"" etc so we ate their for lunch Drinks - the local alcohol was quite pleasant and plentiful in choice, international brand mixers were also included. Pools - the infinity pool was not to our taste as most of the sun beds were under low lying trees so offered little sunlight. We opted for the residents pool which offered lots of sunbed space, lovely pool staff, its own bar (with friendly bar men) and 2 jacuzzis. The staff kept the pool and surrounding area so clean. LOcation - right on the beach, although too rough to swim the sea was fab for a dip and a mess about in the waves (sadly an English man drowned whilst we were there - he did however ignore the no swim warnings) and the staff at the hotel were fantastic with his poor wife and handled the situation with dignity and respect. There are a couple of shops just outside the hotel and bentota is a 20 minute drive away if u want to see a real local town. Staff - we have friends in Sri Lanka and our good friend Sunil introduced us to the hotel manager and several other people who ensured our stay was (almost) perfect. It was the first time we saw so many female staff in a Sri Lankan hotel and it was refreshing and showed they are more forward thinking than other hotels we have stayed in over there. himaesha was a lovely lady and a real asset to the hotel. We also found fernando (who stemmed to work everywhere) a pleasure to spend time with-always smiling and upbeat. All in all the staff are top notch throughout the hotel. NEgatives I travelled in a small group (5 of us) one of which was disabled and myself on my own so I requested rooms together, we did not get them and could not of been any further apart - being spread out on 3 separate corridors. Rooms - balcony size varies two of the rooms had huge balconies with amazing views and mine you could not swing a cat on it! My room also had a view of a large tree! The rooms are very dark and lighting needs to be looked at as they do not make much difference in the rooms, if you get rooms 242 or close by request a change I tried and was told the hotel was fully booked.... Beach sellers - that is where they belong but for some reason the guards were allowing them within the grounds (not as far as the pool side) weaving between the beds on the grass which if I had been sat in the area would have seriously hacked me off. So that's it, we loved it, want to return and would recommend the heritance ahungalla",positive
"We have just spent a wonderful 2weeks at the Heritance Ahungalla . Our first impression of the hotel was. It looked a little tired and in need of a refurbishment, especially our room. But we have never stayed at such a warm and friendly hotel . The staff were marvellous , especially Warooni ( not sure if correct spelling ) and Jananjaya in the restaurant . The food in the buffet restaurant was exceptional ,again possibly the best all inclusive we have had. There were always plenty of sun beds . The pool attendants were most helpful. We preferred the residents pool as it was very relaxing with the occasions monkey, chipmunk, and huge lizards for company. The beach was also very nice for an early morning stroll. Would not hesitate in returning here. Loved every minute.",positive
"My wife & I have just returned from a 2 week holiday staying at The Heritance Ahungalla resort & we can only say....wow what a great hotel, the setting,staff,food were fantastic. Please try the seafood & fine dining restaurants, you will not be disappointed. The overall atmosphere is one of pure relaxation. We will be back.",positive
"Stayed 20 Mar-03 Apr 18. Located approx 2.5 hours drive south of Negombo airport (Columbo is 30km south) on the west coast. This hotel was built in 1981 by a Dutch designer. The hotel has many open plan areas, foyers and alcoves etc, all with fully matured plants and trees making it considerably more pleasant than your average modern hotel. Set along the beach with 2 very large Mis-shaped (not the standard rectangle!) infinity pools looking on to the ocean and beach. It also has 2 jacuzzis at one of the pools. It is common to see the local wildlife in and around the hotel including monkeys, squirrels, large monitor lizards, a vast array of birds and if your lucky, a snake! (I only saw one on the beach which was a black 7-8’ Rat snake which is apparently non venomous and the most common snake!). The staff across the whole hotel are mostly pleasant and friendly and always said hello when passing etc. During our stay, the guests were predominantly British and German with a few other mixed nationalities. Rooms: Varying standards available although dated due to the age of the hotel, they are cleaned twice daily as well as beds being turned etc. Bed linen is of very good quality and very comfortable. A variety of power sockets are available in the rooms including uk 3 pin, multi voltage shaver in the bathroom and a multipurpose socket in the room. A below average Hair dryer is also available as well as a TV, kettle and tea/coffee. Also included is a fridge / mini bar*(see all inclusive comments below). Food: There are a number of eating venues but those on all inclusive have fewer choices which come free but to be honest, the main restaurant has sufficient enough variety to cater for most. I highly recommend the Sri Lankan food and the curries are to die for which I eat most days although I was not brave enough to eat one for breakfast! Additionally, the head chef often walks round at meal times and asks if your happy and if there is anything you would like made especially which he will gladly do! The service in the restaurant can become a little chaotic during peak times and drinks may take a while to turn up etc. For those that need a taste from home occasionally and are on the all inclusive package, the snack bar serves chips, burgers, club sandwiches etc up to midnight. Drinks: The bars are open all day for beer (Lion), cocktails (limited if on AI!), basic tea and coffee (if on AI you will need to pay for cappuccino, latte etc). Coke and Coke Zero are also available on AI. Pool side/Sun loungers: Fortunately, this is not the sort of hotel that attracts (or needs) the sun bed warriors who get up early to claim a spot! This hotel has modern, comfortable, wooden loungers everywhere. On arrival at the pool sides or garden areas you need only pick a spot, the pool attendant will locate you the required amount of loungers, and bring you your loungers Cushions and towels. Note: no towel cards required! Just leave them on the lounger when finished. Also note, there are no loungers allowed on the beach. The main attraction for myself at this hotel is the lack of annoying entertainment staff around the pool areas constantly on their microphone forcing entertainment. Bliss! All Inclusive Package! To justify my following comparison, all of my larger 2 week holidays over a numbers of recent years have been in the Caribbean staying in RIU hotels (Palaces etc) and there is a RIU situated next door to this hotel (2 min walk). However, unlike the RIU next door the all inclusive in the Heritance hotel does NOT include the contents of the mini bar in your room and you will be billed for everything you use. Additionally, and one that causes the most controversy is the wine! This is ONLY available in the main restaurant at lunch and dinner! You will NOT be able to get any wine at any of the bars in the evenings unless you pay for it! As we only generally drink wine in the evenings we chose to buy a bottle most nights which for an average red or white costs approx 5000 plus an additional charge of 1000 for corkage - total approx £30 per bottle!!! Hindsight: If you are the type that likes to be out and about a lot, plan what you want to do in Sri Lanka before you book your hotel and then choose one central to your requirements. There are lots of things to do and are very spread out and some journeys are a considerable distance on mostly poor roads (less a few new highways). This one is ideal for whale watching in Mirissa at the southern tip, about 1.30 to drive. Pros: Outstanding and well established hotel with great staff.👍 No annoying pool side entertainment.👍 No sun bed wars and the beds are not 3 Deep at the pool side!👍 Cons: Wine! ie; The lack of regular access to it on the All inclusive package.☹️ Mini bar is not on AI package.☹️ Summary: Assuming my wine requirements subside and I choose to come back to Sri Lanka, I would absolutely use this hotel again. I highly recommend this hotel over any other 5 star hotels I have been in, including the RIUs. This hotel is exceptional and skims off most of the annoying traits of large hotels. I have rated this hotel a 5 out of 5 irrespective of the AI package issues as the hotel is Excellent and should be graded as such. If the geographical area works for your trip, go for it as you definitely won’t be disappointed. Enjoy 👍",positive
"This was a family holiday with my husband, son and his girlfriend. The holiday was booked via Tui. We weren’t sure what to expect as this was the first package holiday we had booked for some years. We booked an all inclusive suite, which came with a bath big enough for two. All rooms had sea views. There was plenty of room, fruit daily and a welcome bottle of god wine. This is a Beautiful open plan hotel with a fantastic infinity pool which was like a bath in the afternoons. Monkeys roam freely around the hotel corridors. Lizards walk between the sunbeds. Excellent choice of food at breakfast, lunch and dinner and if you were still hungry there was a cafe and bar open for burgers, sandwiches and home made fish fingers. The only down side to this hotel was access to sightseeing, most of the trips involved at leat 2-3 hour mini bus or coach trips and the sea was too rough to swim in properly. There are no sunbeds on the beach and no life savers. The Red flag warnings were up all of the time, however this was not the hotels fault, but is something to bear in mind if you want to snorkel or love beaches. The turtle sanctuary was a highlight and were released six turtle babies back into the sea, there were at least Four weddings at the hotel whilst we were there, all beautiful, therefore an excellent choice for a wedding! We would definitely re-visit and recommend this hotel.",positive
This hotel is in a great location. The staff cannot do enough for you but they are not in your face. We had a very relaxing time. The hotel is immaculately clean and the food is lovely. Rated as 4 star but I would give it 5,positive
"Since we had a corporate event with our staff in Dialog Axiata to encourage and entertain their motivation towards the company we had to organize it very carefully. so, for that we had a great help from Mr Praveen, Mr Prasanna and Mr Nipun to experience what we actually expected. they have organized that to have the maximum fun for our staff with out disturbing to the other in-house guests during the event and we had a wonderful dinner buffet without any single complain. For that we like to thank to the chef too for his cordination. so we like to appreciate all the staff members of Heritance who gave us a great corporate to conduct this event successfully.",positive
This resort hotel has a great relaxed feel and plenty of space. Right on a really good beach or plenty of space for lounging around the pool or in the grounds. Nothing locally to walk to and so very much a beach vacation. About an thirty minute drive to Galle proved a superb visit. Eating tends to be buffet based.,positive
"Sri Lanka has been my dream since I remember. I wanted everything to be perfect, so I spent a very long time picking the right place to spend my days in this beautiful country. And I found this hotel, Heritance... I have a few very strict conditions about the location, food, staff, beach. Every little detail was important to me. I hate new, too shiny, too luxurious hotel. I prefer something with longer history. I also traveled all by myself but I never felt threatened or in danger. I've felt completely safe in this lovely place. The only thing that annoyed me was the sellers who persecuted me when I wanted to be alone and walk around the beach. I could not even pass one kilometer, I always had to go back. But this is their character I was ready for that. Im really excited that I will be there again this year during April:) Can not wait to see you again Heritance!",positive
"The room we had (307) was a good size with a nice balcony overlooking the trees and beach. It was clean, with tea making facilities, a fridge and safe. The bathroom could have done with a bit of attention, the shower leaked out at the bottom meaning the mat was always soaking and there seemed to be a water leak from the sink meaning the floor around it was always wet. The cleaning of the room was excellent and there was always an array of flowers or towel decorations on the bed. There are 2 pools which were kept nice and clean. There are sun loungers around the pool and on the grass area and the attendant was always on hand to supply the cushions and towels. The beach is lovely although between the pool and beach there are a few dogs and you are pestered by sellers of cloths, trips etc. and you can feel unsafe leaving the hotel environment. The all inclusive buffet was very good with lots of choice and different themes throughout the week, although at the busy time of 7pm - 8pm we were asked to have a drink in the bar as there was no room. The Jute restaurant looked very nice but very expensive for all inclusive guests who had already paid for an evening meal, perhaps if there was a happy hour from 7pm-8pm where all inclusive guests could dine for half price that would take some pressure off the main restaurant. Overall a lovely 10 day stay, only wish it was longer.",positive
"My family booked this lovely Hotel online. We enjoyed our holiday there - it's a great place - close to the beach; good food; friendly service. The hotel has some kind of activity going on every day for all age groups, including activity for kids......the staff were kind enough to upgrade us, as in the recent past....it was a pleasant experience, and a relaxing holiday for us.",positive
I spent 3 nights in this beautiful hotel with my wife & my then 10 months old son. Hotel reservation staff members were so kind to upgraded us to a suit where we had a baby cot too. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay there as all staff members were very friendly and respectful towards us and one particular lady who was the restaurant supervisor even looked after our son while we were having our meals whenever she was working. It’s surrounded by beautiful scenes and i would definitely go back there when I next go to Sri Lanka.,positive
For last 7 years I have been to this property for more than 4 times. Every time the staff surprised us with their warm service and great smiles. Excellent food with Sri Lankan touch. Great property and enjoyed the dips in pool. Kudos to the team,positive
"We booked through Tui who apart from booking it after I booked on line did nothing, even after booking the wedding package we had to basically organise everything ourselves. The rep at the resort ( Gerard ) was helpful though. 👍 The hotel was superb, the staff were really helpful, the wedding coordinator ( Imarsha ) was so helpful it was untrue! Even to the point of changing the time by 3 hours due to weather forecast. The pool, bar and restaurant staff were great too. The room was spotless, cleaners every day with clean sheets and towels twice daily. The food was really good, but the only fault is that like all other All inclusive it was a little repetitive but that’s expected. The wedding itself was the best day ever, even more than we expected, the staff sorted everything and it couldn’t have gone any better. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of them from my wife and I. I would highly recommend the Heritance if you want a nice quiet holiday, good food and in general just being looked after. The one down side which is really out of the hotels hands is the Tuk tuk drivers outside the main gates, they do tend to pester and follow you as soon as you step foot outside! But they are only trying to make a living.",positive
"Many years of returns to this place give high expectations. Heritance really take care. As usual the staff is making the stay to a pleasure. One unforgettable dinner on the beach was the perfect ending. Mr Sisira promised god memories and we got, thanks!",positive
We had a great get-together at the place. Food was excellent. Staff was Friendly. Nice location which is easily accessible. They got two large swimming pools out of which one is exclusively for the stay-in guests. So your holiday will not be ruined by the outsiders. Great for couples too,positive
"The hotel is situated in Galle road, Ahungalla and can easily be accessed by a public bus. The hotel was good, clean, and the food was nice. The hotel is built with an antique look/theme however. The old rooms are a bit gloomy and therefore, you might want to spend some extra bucks and ask for a newer/premium room (which I got). There are two large pools and there are 2 small jacuzzis (no extra fee) next to one of those pools!",positive
"We recently returned from our stay at this hotel where we were greeted with smiles and great service. Our room was clean and very spacious with lovely views. The staff at this hotel are excellent, special mention for the reception staff, our room boy and particularly Asela who could not do enough for us. Breakfast fayre was excellent, lunch extensive and evening meals plenty to choose from. Would certainly recommend.",positive
"We have just returned from a 2 week (all inclusive) stay at the Heritance and had a great time. Our room was a bit tired but I believe is due to be refurbished, some rooms already having been renovated. The hotel is in a good position on a lovely beach – great for a walk and it would take us just over an hour to walk to the far end and back. The sea is a bit rough for swimming in and the red flag was up for our entire stay, however it was good fun in the waves if you don’t go out your depth. There are 2 decent sized swimming pools and we never had any problem getting a sunbed. Being all inclusive, all our meals were taken in the buffet restaurant. However there is an a la carte and a fish restaurant if you fancy a change, although you would have to pay for these and there is no discount. We found there was plenty of variety on the buffet and the food was of an excellent quality with authentic local dishes and of course a wide choice of different curries (green pea/cashew and beetroot/potato were some of our favourites). All the staff were very friendly and efficient. The chap that cleaned our room (319) was excellent and the bed was always beautifully decorated with flowers. Jananjaya in the restaurant was always there to top up our drinks. When you first arrive and walk on the beach or go out the front gate you will be approached by people looking to sell you trips/tuk tuk rides. Whilst it can get a bit annoying they are definitely better value than the tour operator excursions. We had a taxi to the fort at Galle for £30 between the two of us and the driver waited for us, whereas the tour company were charging £55 each for a half day trip to Galle. We also took tuk tuks to Brief garden by Bevis Bawa and the Lunuganga Estate of Geoffrey Bawa, and they were some of the highlights of our trip. There is an ATM about a 10 minute walk up the road. One thing to be aware of at the airport when you leave Sri Lanka is that you cannot take bottled water onto the plane, even if you have purchased it in the departure lounge. Oh and by the way there is a public holiday when there is a full moon and no alcohol can be sold anywhere and is not available at the hotel.",neutral
(+)Same old same old... and it is what we like about this overprised hotel. We recodnised an amazing flavor of Heritance Ahungalla first go. Our suite room was perfect. Greate stuff and cervice level. (-)The hotel was overbooked. After checking - in (13p.m.) we could not find a free couch with the pool area and put our things on the stairs. We could not to find the stuff as well. The next day was the same situation.,neutral
"From the moment we arrived we were greeted with smiles and fantastic service. The level of service throughout the hotel was without exception first class. We stayed in a room overlooking the main swimming pool and also a suite, both of which were lovely. All of our wedding arrangements were taken care of seamlessly, and the whole experience of getting married abroad could not have been smoother. A special thanks has to go to Shanika Jayasekara who co-ordinated our wedding and was there throughout the day making sure everything went to plan. Shanika and Mawatte Mawanna both Executive Officers at the hotel kindly acted as witnesses on the day for which we were both very grateful. On the wedding day we had a tropical storm in the middle of the service, this meant we had to quickly re-locate to a covered area, this was done by many hands in little time, everyone very willing to make the best of the situation. This made a big difference to our day and eventually the sun came back out and we finished the service in the gardens of the hotel. Many thanks for making our wedding unforgettable.",positive
"We spent 3 nights here and had what can only be described as a well catered for break. Super friendly staff within a medium sized property located right on the beach is a dream combination. With two pools and the beachfront location, you can not fail to find an area and an ambiance to suit your taste. Quiet, lively, pool side or beach, you can find a number of differing locations. Unfortunately, outside of the resort the small town has little to offer but Bentota and Galle are in the area and can be reached from the hotel.",positive
This was our 11 th visit to this hotel designed by Geoffrey Bawa. The General manager Sisira & his staff are very approachable & helpful as always. We had the previledge to meet up with Thushara & Prasanna both of whom we first met at their sister hotel in Kandalama in 1995. Thushara at f&b was outstanding as expected & went way beyond the call of duty to make our stay that much more comfortable & homely The main restaurant & coffee lounge served great food & our room on the 3rd level was magnificient,positive
"I visited with my adult son & we were really impressed with this hotel. The layout was spacious, the room immaculate & the gardens lovely. The buffet has plenty to choose from & was busy enough that the food was fresh & not over cooked, and the a la carte restaurant food was varied & excellent. The garden area is gorgeous & the 2 pools are large & the T shapes made them really good to swim in as there are plenty of ways to swim lengths. The staff were friendly & efficient enough & the bar areas were buzzy without feeling crowded. The beach is expansive, but the sea was somewhat rough - recommended for looking at rather than swimming in.",positive
"I stayed with my family including my two kids for 3 days , it was nice and very enjoyable stay for all of us. Food is excellent (taste and variety ), adding resturatn service given by the staffs made us more comfortable. Overall very friendly service all over",positive
"Having spent 8 days braving the roads of Sri Lanka touring their cultural triangle, we arrived at this hotel looking forward to a lovely rest for 7 days and we were not disappointed. This hotel is right on the beach and there is very little around it. It is for this reason that we went half board. A good decision is some respects as there is only one other bar 500 Metres up the beach along with a beach shack. The food at the beach bar was fine and considerably cheaper than the hotel should you be buying on a day to day basis. We often walked to the beach shack at a lunchtime for a beer (300 rupees and considerably larger than that offered by the hotel for 600R). The hotel, in effect has three restaurants. The buffet, the fine dining and the fish restaurant. If you are all inclusive or ½ board you can use the buffet (drinks are extra) but if you choose to use the other two you have to pay. We did not use the fine dining but the food looked good. We did use the fish restaurant on my birthday and it was a pleasant change to the buffet. The surrounding are not particularly appealing, the table and stools not comfortable. Because it was my birthday they had prepared a lovely table for me and provided ‘proper’ chairs making for a much more comfortable experience. The fish was fresh and delicious and went well with the white wine we had ordered. Because Sri Lanka does not produce wine, it is imported and so by locals standards, quite expensive, but no more so that what we pay in the UK. I do feel that the hotel could offer a discount at these two restaurants if you had paid for ½ board or all inclusive but chose not to use the buffet The buffet has a large selection of food on offer and so if you were just using the one hotel for your stay in this country a great way to try the curries that seem to make up the staple diet. (You can even have curry for breakfast). There was considerably more than curry though raging from salads (all cleaned in bottled water), soups to fish and meats. The range of sweets was very good and finished the meal off nicely. My criticism is that perhaps there is too much choice with the main course and as a consequence the food was on the whole not that hot and it was definitely quantity over quality. I cannot say the food was bad, but in my experience it was no more than average. I have certainly eaten a lot better around the world. Breakfast was once again a buffet with a very good selection or hot food and pastries and continental. In my opinion a better experience than the dinner. Turning to the rooms. We were first given a room on the second floor (they use the American system so no ground floor (1)) with a sea view. Number 229. Ok there were some trees in the way so perhaps sea glimpses would be more appropriate, but that did not distract from the fact that we could see and hear it. The room was not that far from the reception but we were told it was a quiet room. It was very ‘tired’ with the decor needing to be updated. At around 9pm we could hear the singer in the bar and also people arriving in reception. The music went onto 11:00 by which time i had been to reception to arrange to move. This was the only major complaint I have as the man on the desk first told me the hotel was full and then looked at his watch as if it was relatively early and made me feel that it was my fault that at 10pm I wanted to get to bed. After not accepting the excuse that it was full they arranged for us to move further along the corridor to the far end of the hotel, well away from the bar and reception the following day. This was in the same design room but one that had been decorated and refurbished. This had been done to a high standard and was very comfortable. We had this for free but they do charge $20 a night for the privilege of having a room that has been refurbished. We were told that the original rooms had not been decorated in 32 years. The room was cleaned daily sheets and towels changed. In the evening housekeeping came round to see if everything is ok and if you needed anything. I think at this point I need to say that all the staff were always friendly, polite and willing to help. Nothing seemed too much effort for them. I cannot praise the staff enough and they certainly make your stay enjoyable. There are two pools, the infinity pool that you see as you arrive at reception, and another in the grounds that whilst not infinity is big enough to swim/cool off and is far less crowded, by far the better choice in my opinion. There are more than enough sun beds, but as at most resorts there are some that insist on putting their towels on the beds that they consider their own for the duration of their stay. If you are prepared to tip the pool attendants, as some did, they will put towels on the beds for you, as they set them up early in the morning If you have a bed by the perimeter you do get hawkers that are in the grounds of the hotel, but stay on the perimeter trying to sell you trousers and sarongs (my wife bought two pairs of trousers at a shop on our travels for 500R whilst the hawkers wanted 2000R for one pair!) I am told that the hotel intend to keep them out of the grounds in the near future. I am aware that this seems a bit negative, not something that I intended as i wanted to give constructive criticism and to make it informative for those considering booking this hotel. I would have no hesitation in booking this hotel. The new rooms are lovely, the ground beautiful (watch out for the little tree squirrels and the small Iguanas) that are lovely to see. Of course in conclusion I reiterate that staff is amongst the best I have encountered and make this hotel what it is.",neutral
"We stayed at Heritance Ahungalla for 3 nights. It’s a well maintained property with a very clean beach and lush mangroves around. The interiors are great, good swimming pools (2), reasonably decent staff compared to some of the other properties we stayed in and decent food. They have a couple of restaurants, bars etc. with plenty to chose from with a large buffet spread as well. The menu is largely continental and mix of Sri Lankan cuisine. The customer service was fine, but not as per 5 star standards. Overall, good stay and they can do better.",positive
"We spent a week at Heritance between 28.12.2017 and 4.01.2018. Everything was perfect. We lived at the highest floor (room no.301) with fantastic seaview. Room was clean, spacious and well equipped. Hotel area very well maintained and not crowded (no problems with sunbeds and quiet places to relax). Choice and quality of food was amazing. The New Year's party was organized perfectly. (our best New Year's party ever). Long and clean beach excellent for walks (no problems with ""beachboys""). But the best thing at Ahungalla is staff. Always polite and helpful. Special thanks for Mr. Praveen Fernando (food & beverage executive), Chef D.J Manjula and Mr. Nuwan Sasanka. Thank you very much for everything and see you in December 2018.",positive
Fantastic beach but they do not allow sun loungers and shades on the sand. I have been told the hotel does not encourage you to use the beach in case locals come along trying to sell items. This to date is our only complaint.,neutral
"My wife and I stayed here for three weeks and overall found it to be a comfortable and very friendly hotel. This is branded as a five star hotel, but in our experience, these star ratings are pretty meaningless and we have found that nearly everywhere we have been in the world. If you are influenced by star ratings you may be disappointed for reasons I will explain later. The public areas are expansive and the hotel looks out over a lovely beach area. The red warning flag flew every day of our stay and you would do well to take notice of this because there are strong undercurrents. But we swam nearly every day in the hotel pools both of which are large and set in the attractive hotel grounds. Our room was on the 3rd floor and a good size with all the usual fittings including tv with mostly English channels, very effective shower, balcony overlooking hotel gardens, hair dryer and a safe. One day a room attendant arrived to change the safe and after emptying, picked it up and put it on his trolley. Not so safe then! There is a well equipped gymn on the 2nd floor and there is good Wi-Fi throughout the hotel and even in the grounds it isn’t too bad. Here I have to mention what many visitors will regard as the main criticism of the hotel. The rooms are a bit dated and well used. By that I mean they do look a bit tired and in need of refurbishment. Having said that, I don't think people should be put off by this because there are many really good aspects to this property. For example, we stayed on an all inclusive basis and the food in the main restaurant is outstanding. Every day there are at least seven or eight choices of main course. If that's not enough Chef Manjula who walks the restaurant floor during service, will cook something to your liking. Most of the cuisine is curry orientated but you can get plain fish or meat. He cooked a very tasty sirloin for me. Coupled with the friendly service, and the delightful staff, this really is the main selling point of the hotel. It is worth noting if you are all inclusive that you can only get wine (it's Italian) in the main restaurant and not from the bars. This was a bit irritating for us since we are wine drinkers and didn't want to drink beer, shorts or cocktails they serve in the bar areas. The other point to be aware of is that for religious reasons, if it is a full moon the law forbids the sale of any alcoholic drink for the whole day. There are quite severe penalties if any establishment is found selling or distributing alcohol. We also got caught out on Independence day and regional election day both of which were no alcohol days. The hotel has two fine dining restaurants and a seafood shack called the Wadiyah. We tried this and had fresh grilled fish right by the beach. In our opinion, it is not particularly fine dining. The table mats were dirty, only bar stools were provided until we asked for proper chairs, the music stopped and was never restarted, the salad was very small and the area is poorly lit. It lacked any real atmosphere. You have to pay for any of the alternative dining and we paid 15000 Sri Lankan rupees which is about £75 including wine. We also dined in the Upper Room where mostly European food is served and had New Zealand lamb which was very good. In our opinion this is a good hotel with excellent food in the main restaurant and wonderful friendly staff. They really do go the extra mile to make your stay a happy one. This all goes a long way towards overcoming the increasingly pressing need for refurbishment of the bedrooms.",neutral
Had a fabulous 2day stay at this resort.the food was awesome especially the breakfast spread.the beach is awesome and the spa is great.everything about this resort makes you feel absolutely relaxed! Loved every moment if my stay here,positive
"Loving this place, staff are friendly and helpful. Food is one of the best we have had. Sea is a little rolling so snorkelling is out but with two large pools like bath water can’t moan. Sea is great for paddle and a lovely long walk on beach. Would definitely come back again ❤️🌴🐒🍺🍰",positive
"We spent two nights of total rest and relaxation. Staff were friendly and helpful. The high tea was a disappointment as it took nearly an hour to be delivered and when it did arrive the food was disappointing too. Breakfast and dinner buffets had an extensive selection of food. Sous-chef Manjula was very helpful and got us some special dishes from the kitchen. The lady making the hoppers was very kind and helpful too. Beautiful landscaped gardens. Everything was clean and tidy. Great after dinner entertainment. During the day there are plenty of activities to keep the guests entertained. (Water aerobics, beach volleyball etc)",positive
"We stayed in this hotel 3 nights during our trip in Sri Lanka and I have to say, that definitly, when I will be in Sri Lanka again, so for sure back to this hotel. Absolutly great services. Very nice, helpful and always smiling staff. Very well equiped room. And what is very important: Fantastic food with huge veriety. Nice and clean 2 swimmingpools and outdoor whirlpools with warm watter. As well the beach is very nice, without sunbeds and umbrellas, but we stayed in the hotel garden, where is a lot of different treas and palms, it means as well shadow, and we were only going there for swimming. You can watch at fantastic sunset. When you go to the beach and you will continue to the right side, there is little rock with nice view to the ocean and small fishing harbour. At the end of the beach is as well small restaurant Sunshine Ahungalla where is great sea food with funny prices and I have eaten there the best butter-garlic shrimps ever. For sure it is good idea to have in the hotel only hb and for lunch to walk to this place. I can only recommend this place to everybody - families, couples, singles.",positive
"So first impressions... Hotel design and overall impression is just lovely. It is airy, with open atrium spaces dotted throughout the hotel, filled with established trees, beautiful. Room - needs some TLC and more clothes hangers!! NB there never is in any hotel!!! Extra ones delivered within the hour. but overall was clean and spacious. Twin bed quickly made into KS (within 30 mins!) and handle not attached to drawer... fixed next day. Could do with some more easy accessible plug points in the room. All staff very friendly and keen to help and someone always cleaning somewhere! Food - OMG!! Curry heaven!! Mix of western and traditional, some curries not for the faint hearted... Head Chef walks around the restaurant speaking to the guests and offering to cook requested dishes (within reasonable limits) which is a nice touch. Things to know: Lunch at the coffee bar a good option, fish fingers and chips delicious and not what you expect.... sometimes service here a bit slow, but you are on holiday!! Go for the quiet pool, though more people getting to know about it, on sunny days monkeys come to the fruit trees here about 5, but not every day. Lots of wildlife, lizards, geckos, palm squirrels (look like chipmunks), birds and the random cats and dogs Do have a look at the non-inclusive cocktail menu : ) Be careful of what is not all inclusive...Diet Coke not, zero coke is!! Nor are the bits in the mini bar Evening entertainment mixed, but the Sri Lanka day on a Friday is lovely. Unusually, the hotel shop is not very well stocked, so do not rely on it for emergency toiletries!! Luckily I don’t. Sells mainly gifts. Dakshika and Trilishiya on the reception desk always greet you with a lovely smile and will try and help any way they can, they are both a real credit to the hotel. Danuka in the bar area is really helpful and attentive (swear he has a twin brother as he is always there!!) and very kind. Jananjaya is great with keeping us topped up with tea and coffee at breakfast!! A thank you in Sinhalese is always appreciated. Hawkers on the beach and edge of hotel do stop you but will take no for an answer, always haggle by at least half. Chaminder at the beach great for arranging transport, did a tuk tuk to Bentota and driver stayed with us the whole time and translated and helped haggle. Later in the holiday we hired a mini bus with driver through Chamindra to take four of us to Galle, firstly £50 all in versus £50 each they TUI! Stopped at a moonstone mine on the way, did a spot of shopping en-route. At Galle, walked and drove round the fort and town, stopped for lunch on the way back in Hikkadula, then had walk round Natural Silk factory and shop on the way back, some lovely bits there! Bought some tea from a local tea shop in Ahungalla for a very good price and lastly to the Spice Garden in Ahungalla, again interesting but beware the hard sell and the ‘free’ massages which are far from it...donations are expected. Got picked up at 10 and back by 5 Trips: Elephant day at Uduwalawe amazing! Long coach trip there and back about 4 hours each way. Loo and later lunch stop at Centauria Wild, lunch ok, but the hotel also gives you a lunch box as well as breakfast one! Give one away to the driver , Well worth the money and the early start!! (4.30 pick up back about 6.30) Whale watching - accept there is no guarantee of what you see, we luckily saw dolphins, pilot whales and blue whale, amazing!! However, if it is a rainy day, take a change of clothes and a waterproof bag for your camera and phone!! We got soaked by rain and salt spray from the boat, plastic bucket seats really uncomfortable and not for the larger derriere ... the real shame is the amount of boats out at the same time, convinced it scared things off! The boats are not well designed in that the seats are very close together so it is really hard to get across and see things on the other side of the boat and some people do not move to let others see. The whole itinerary is great value for money if the weather is kind, but if you can stretch to booking a private car and boat, do it! Now I know what I know, that’s what’s I would do next time. This is a 4.30 pick up, back for just after 7 Madu river cruise - AMAZING! Do it!! Great value for money, short coach journey (less than 20 mins) we were lucky enough for the time of year to plant a mangrove sapling and release a baby turtle into the ocean, but think both these things depends on the time of year, so ask the rep. It is an afternoon trip so you get to spend the morning by the pool, back by 6.30 Kandy day, very very very long day... picked up at 4am from hotel got back at 9pm..... did the part coach, then train, then coach back, train was fun, a throwback to the 60’s... some other groups got back at 11pm... Temple of the Tooth, whilst very interesting, we went the day before a National holiday and it was rammed! Beautiful building and setting, but too busy to take everything in. Lunch was the usual buffet affair, then onto the botanical gardens, lovely if you like plants and gardens, sadly wasted on me! Onto the tea factory which was really interesting, you can buy it cheaper from a local supermarket, but from the factory you know exactly where it came from. Final stop was a herbal and spice garden, which again is very interesting if you have not done it before. Least favourite of the four visits as too long a day and too much crammed in. Remember...4.00 am pick up and back for 9pm.... if you are lucky! In summary, loved Sri Lanka, the people, the environment and would very happily come back to the Heritance.",positive
"What a location, with the pool ,beach and sea combined! With spacious rooms and awesome food what else you expect! On top of all is the lovely staff who were always smiling and offering their services. Check in and out was very personal with welcoming. Thanks to all the lovely staff!",positive
My partner bought me here for my birthday Hotel is lovely & friendly staff . The house keeping staff where very friendly . Lots of food and drink to offer . We loved the wadiya shack where we eat for my birthday and the birthday cake getting delivered to our room was a nice touch. Only fault we would of liked to walk on beach more but couldn’t because as soon as you foot hit the sand you would be asked to buy sarongs and to go on trips we kept declining but would get followed .,positive

"On 9th of February I and my colleague at SLITHM went to Heritance Ahungala hotel as a dayouting. I would like to mention the first impression of the hotel which is the warm welcome by the hotel staff was excellent. The staff was very friendly and supportive. They cared about us throughout the day. We enjoyed our day very well. The hotel itself had arranged some team building activities. They were wonderful. The pool was perfect. The sea view is relaxing. The food was delicious. We got a five star hotel experience. And I would like to give special compliments and thanks to the Food and Beverage executive Mr. PRAVEEN FERNANDO, who was a graduate of Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management, for arranging our tour to Heritance Ahungala and providing us all the facilities. I like to thank rest of the management team and the staff for their great service throughout our vist. I and my fellow colleagues highly recommend this hotel as it provides all the facilities for a real five star experience. Overall Heritance Ahungala is a very nice and calm hotel to relax and enjoy.",positive

"I’m afraid this review is late in being written as we had a new addition. We travelled to Heritance and had a wonderful time. The staff cannot do enough for you and always a happy face. At the time we visited, the rooms were being redone I think, but ours was a little dated. For the value though and the view you really can look past this. It’s like an animal paradise with monkeys, giant fruit bats with a 2 metre wing span, sea eagles and so many more and that’s just around the hotel. The safari is well worth going on where you will see elephants as as bee eaters and so many more. The infinity pool and the beach really make the hotel. The breakfasts and the fresh fruit was so fresh. We had various towel art in our room and the room was cleaned daily. I would recommend to go with a recommended taxi from the hotel as we decided to walk out ourselves and as much as we were safe the road is quite narrow and the buses did get a little bit close to us at speed as we walked to the turtle sanctuary. Also if you walk to the end of the beach to the left as you go on to the beach expect touts at the end who ask for money for through passage. They were just trying to make money but we did not feel completely sure about their intentions. Thanks so much for making our trip a special one and we’d love to go back and enjoy the beach which was nicer than those I saw in many areas of Thailand. A real paradise.",positive
"Our problem started upon our arrival when we were told that we had been upgraded to a luxury room, but it turned out to be an isolated one (at the very end of the hotel) with a view on tennis courts. In addition, the room contained only 2 beds (One queen-sized and another “Extra” bed). As we had explicitly requested (and confirmed twice with our travel agent) a room with 3 beds and a sea view, we made this clear to the staff member who showed us the room. After she spent some time on the phone, she referred us to the manager on duty( Srinath A ). This manager was beyond rude and impatient, immediately telling us that there were no other rooms available for us to change, because apparently we had checked in late (6 pm). Brushing aside this unprofessionalism, we peacefully requested a refund, in order to be available to switch hotels and find what we are looking for elsewhere. At this point, the manager refused and defiantly told us: “We don’t have money at the hotel. Talk to your travel agent to get money, and go''. After spending 3 hours in the lobby and threatening to escalate if we were not refunded our money right away, suddenly and magically, a suite became available for us to move into, which uncovered the lies that were being told before about the hotel being fully-booked. Such dishonesty and disrespect is not worthy of a 5-star hotel.",negative
This is a very nice hotel with 2 pools. Food is great. lovely atmosphere. the staff was great & very helpful Nice place to be. Food is great though NOT much variety. Location is superb near the beach. love this hotel.,positive
"Our trip was in Dec which is a busy month. However when we called them in the morning to check if an early check in was possible they said 12pm would be fine. On our arrival we were made to sit in the lobby for 2 hours. We could have saved that time by coming later if it was not promised for 12 pm. When they finally gave us the room it was not cleaned well and we were told that the family before us had really messed it up and also stayed on way past check out time. Apart from this our stay was good. The room was big and spacious and the beds very comfortable. If the doors were left open a few mosquitoes would get in so its best to keep them shut when going to the pool or beach. The room service was ok. Best to stick to the rice as the burger we ordered was not very good. The fried rice was quite good. The staff are friendly and helpful. The chefs at the live stations in the morning (specially a lady) were very unenthusiastic about serving and overall the service was very poor. We expected more as it is after all a Heritance Hotel and should have 5 star service. The residents pool is the highlight. Its clean, big and quiet so we really enjoyed spending time at the pool. Hope the service improves.",neutral
This place is not too far from Colombo and we could reach the hotel in less than two hours. The pool was big enough to accommodate a big crowd and had a big moderately shallow area so that the kids can enjoy. The beach next to the hotel was clean. The rooms are bit old but well maintained and all the toiletries were there. The condition of the bed was also good. The food was satisfactory for the price paid. Spread was reasonable but the salads section could be improved. The staff was very friendly and supportive. They even offered to make something special for the little kid. Overall a nice experience.,positive
"I was there on Sinhala Tamil New year. Staff is very friendly and rooms are great with sea view. Food was not that good. But the pools were great Very calm and relaxing. They had traditional dances , singers and other entertaining plays. Wonderful place",positive
"We visited our favourite hotel , this time with our second born and entire family. The room we got has been upgraded and was very comfortable. The food has improved even more ( not that it was ever bad), service standard was once again 5 star plus. Hotel had the guest engaged all the time, magic show on Saturday , and cookery demo for the kids,as seen in the attached photograph. Special thanks to F&B manager Mr. Thushara and GM, Mr. Sisira Senaratn e.We look forward to returning again.",positive
"Excellent service, fab location and gorgeous. Beach is clean and wide. The cleanest we have seen so far. It's also a great choice for families as there was a great magic show and a night show. Food was lovely and the hotel in general was excellent value for money.",positive
"Our initial impression was that the hotel was ok but in need of some TLC but to be fair the rooms were kept clean and the general atmosphere made for a very pleasant holiday. General points you may like to note: - the Sri Lankan people are genuinely very friendly which to begin with can confuse westerners. - the beach sales people aren’t actually that troublesome (nor are the dogs) - both pools are lovely though the green pool has far fewer kids - we never had any difficulty actually getting sun beds, though not always were we wanted them and there was a shortage of umbrellas - Food flavours lovely though we personally found the meats tough on occasion. Truthfully food does get a bit same’y after 14 nights. Wine in our first week on the all inclusive package was ropey but seemed to be changed halfway though. People said there had been complaints. - There are 2 complimentary bottles of water in room each day and it is in plentiful supply. - there is 1 “British” electric socket in the room but the rest require an adapter. Wall mounted hair drier ok but nothing special. - mosquitoes are a nightmare - take loads of spray. If you are on a TUI all inclusive it maybe helpful to know: - wine is only included with lunch and dinner. Cocktails are ok but not great. Ask for bottled tonic. - you can eat in the other restaurants at additional cost but with a 15% discount. - some tours (e.g Kandy by train and whale watching) start at 4 or 4.30 in the morning! Which wasn’t pointed out when we booked it. We didn’t get back from Kandy until 9.45pm so a very long (if great) day. We’d also recommend the Madu Nature Tour. 1/2 day with a turtle release at the end - joyous! - upgrade flights if you get the chance. It’s about £250 per flight per person but is worth it in our opinion from the airport lounge to the slightly larger seats it adds to the holiday. To sum up we will return to Sri Lanka but not on an all inclusive basis ...",neutral
"We returned to the hotel after having been affected by the 2004 tsunami, when our holiday was abruptly terminated after just four days. The staff, at the time, had been superb in a very difficult situation especially, as we were on the ground floor and our room and all our possessions had been completely destroyed. It was a great pleasure to return once again. The wonderful design, by Geoffrey Bawa, still impresses, and the location of the hotel - right on a very clean beach - is excellent. I have only one grumble. We were rather disappointed by our luxury room, especially the bathroom, which had limescale all over the shower glass and unpleasant tile grouting. Apart from that, I have nothing but praise. The room boys kept the room spotless, and were very efficient. The food is of an excellent standard, and there is always a wide variety. The breakfasts are superb, usually with two omelette stations - and there is always something unexpected, especially at dinner: roast leg of lamb, a whole roast turkey, a bbq with delicious langoustines. As well as some 'Western-style' food, there is a lovely range of tasty Sri Lankan dishes. Even the bread is impressive, with a wonderful choice of bread loaves and rolls. The pastry chef, and his team, also deserve great praise for the skilfully made, and delicious, deserts. The variety of food is such that one would never get bored with what is on offer. The quality of the staff can make or break a holiday, and the staff at the Heritance are wonderfully helpful, warm and friendly - from the reception desk to the bar staff. We enjoyed cocktails on the restaurant lawn one evening, when the General Manager, hearing of our previous experience, kindly invited us to a really excellent dinner on the beach, making our final night a very memorable one. Thanks to all the Heritance staff for their friendly and welcoming attitude. It makes for a really memorable holiday, and we will definitely return again.",positive
"Arriving at this hotel, it looked rather impressive with its long entrance and infinity pool overlooking the beach and ocean. On closer consideration, expecting five star quality, I was surprised to see stagnant water in some of the fountains, the quality of the material used in the hallways of the hotel looked rather cheap and our room, while quite big and comfortable seemed kind of empty (as if some furniture had been removed or was mssing something). The hotel food was average (which was how I found most of the food during our stay in Sri Lanka). For the positive, we loved the beautiful beach, which was one of the highlights of our trip, the greenery surrounding the pool areas and the natural beauty of it all, was what finally made our stay quite enjoyable (as well as the geckos wandering around). To reiterate, our room was very comfortable, clean and quite large for the three of us, with a very nice, large bathroom. We had a balcony overlooking the pool area and we could hear the waves of the ocean (unfortunately as of the evening we could not leave the doors opened because of the mosquitos).",neutral
"We stayed 6 Night all inclusive in Nov. 2017. We choose to have a small suite and had room 258, which was at the corner of the quiet relax pool area. A great choice. Lots of space, clean, quiet. Our roomboy Rosham was fantastic. Everyday nice decoration of towels, flowers, etc. The food was fabulous. Usually we are not the all inclusive type of guests. And before staying at the Heritance, we did a private 8 day tours throughout the country. The Heritance food chefs managed to have an aboundance of curries, salads, soups and others local dishes at an individual local style level. You could get typical international food, as well as at least 8 different curry per dinner, lunch, ... fantastic. A real pleasure. The staff in general was very attentive and caring. The beach is clean and a long streched out sand beach, so you can walk along it for a while. The resort is clean and tidy an we always found a sun bed for us. Drinks, etc all great. I celebrated my 50th birthday at the Hertiance, and I even got a small surpise cake and flowers after my wife inquired at the reception. I will definitively come again. A big ""Thank You!! to all of the staff.",positive
Had a three night stay at this hotel ideally located on the beach at Ahungalla. The checkin with our group had a few issues with rooms not being ready even after checkin time!! The rooms are clean and tidy and the linen is fresh and cleaned daily. Room 305 is excellent and offers wonderful oceans views. The dining room offers a fine array of meals both at breakfast and dinner. Overall the hotel is quite good but probably in need of a refurbishment.,positive
"We had a family reunion of my mother's extended family, tied up with her 90th birthday celebration last weekend at Heritance Ahungalla. There were 41 members in all, ranging from ages 90 to 1. From giving us a special discount rate and booking code (for the overseas family members ) by the reservation desk at Aitken Spence head office, to the many demands we made at the hotel for the various celebrations - eg;private meeting place to have drinks and to celebrate the 4th birthday of little Luka (a great grand nephew from New Zealand) the hotel lived up to its reservation for warm hospitality. Despite being full, the restaurant staff were somehow able to accommodate all those who came to dinner, with extra tables and chairs sprouting up as occasion demanded; the food was superlative, including BBQ lobster, and many of the overseas relatives who had been touring the island before coming to Ahungalla, declared the food here to be the best. There were many action stations- so guests could watch how vadai/ thosai and other sweetmeats were made. There was a magic show to keep the kids entertained as well as a cultural show, including a devil dancer and fire eater. On Sunday there was even a baking session for the little ones, who were all given a chef's hat and white overall.They also made a special effort to celebrate Thai Pongal with a kolam at the entrance and serving all the related food and sweetmeats associated with the festival. The hotel also offers baby sitting service and some family members felt very comfortable in having them look after the children in their rooms, while they had dinner in the restaurant.I noticed that even the management staff were hands on,helping out as a team with service staff. There is a sense of space and serenity at Heritance Ahungalla which makes it very special. I know now why we chose that hotel, out of all the hotels in Sri Lanka, some with more competitive deals. Shanthi Dias",positive
"Staff really helpful and they try their best to make your stay as lovely as possible. Attention to detail as Kaushal demonstrates with his towel art after cleaning the room. Massage in-house was particularly high standard, Balanesse style and they'd been trained well. We paid to upgrade and although the hotel is in need of refurbishment in places, it was good enough for The President of Latvia, who was in the rooms next to ours.",positive
I loved the hotel its in a quaint place and just near the beach. The pool is excellent and the best thing is the location right by the water. WE spent most of our time between the pool and the beach. Need i say more!! Service and rooms were nice. Check in was easy and food was good. Had a good time here.,positive
"Our second visit to the hotel, the staff was great from the check in very attentive. No issues what so ever. The standards were really kept to the level. Food was great and plenty of variety. Dining staff was very attentive and made sure refills were on time. We opted for the green pool which was much quieter and private with the Jacuzzi. Very well maintained and cleaned. Stayed at the family suite and was thus far the best stay done down south. A special thanks to the GM-Sisira Senarthne who made it his duty to pay attention to all guest regardless the category and keep everyone happy and enjoyable. Thanks & keep up the excellent work. Sumesh",positive
From the moment we stepped into the hotel it was nothing but amazing hospitality and good conversations will all the people working at the hotel made us feel welcomed. From the room to the food to the beach everything was amazing. I would definitely recommend this for anyone and definitely would visit again for a much more greater period.,positive
"This is a fabulous hotel in a splendid location, with good facilities and very friendly and helpful staff. Our recent 3-week stay was our 12th visit to the Heritance in Ahungalla – and it was just as enjoyable as the previous 11 times. We had not been here since the new Riu down the beach opened its doors (in 2016) and were slightly apprehensive about the possible effects this might have had on the surroundings. We need not have worried. Yes, the Riu is an eyesore, but you do not really see it from the gardens of the Heritance or its stretch of beach. Moreover, the Riu's guests, by and large, do not seem to spend much time on the beach. The Heritance has much more extensive grounds and we had a lovely room overlooking the residents' pool and the garden around it. Our arrival unfortunately coincided with that of a major cyclone – the first major storm in this part of the country for decades apparently – and there was quite a bit of damage to the garden and parts of the hotel roof. However, the staff worked very hard to minimize the disruption and within 48 hours things were more or less back to normal (– returning the roof to its original condition took a little longer). The food is excellent. We particularly like the sumptuous breakfasts. My personal favourite is the swordfish curry (with a hopper or two), but if you prefer a more European-style breakfast you will not be disappointed by the choice available. There is virtually something for absolutely everybody. Whenever possible we try to grab a table outside. The setting is superb. I almost forgot: there is a huge range of fresh fruit available, including some quite unusual types. Our own preference for dinner is a Sri Lankan style 'rice & curry' (in a semi-outdoor restaurant they somewhat misleadingly refer to as the 'coffee shop'), but the main restaurant offers a huge buffet (with a theme that changes every day) if that is more your thing. There is also a seafood 'shack' and an a-la-carte restaurant offering high-end cooking. There is free wi-fi throughout the premises and it works well. I have already said that the staff are great. We always feel like royalty when we're here – and I'm sure many other guests feel the same. Our room boy, Kaushal, was excellent and kept everything spick-and-span. He also decorated our bed beautifully with flowers and animals fashioned out of towels. The waiters, too, are fabulous. Special thanks to Nihal and Jacob – and the kitchen staff, who were very accommodating (as usual). If you are looking for a well-equipped, quiet hotel on a fantastic beach, you will find the Heritance hard to beat. If you come here for a longer stay, you can use it as a base for exploring places like Galle and Hikkaduwa or the Bentota area. All are easily reached by tuk-tuk. If you want to see wild elephants, you can visit Udawalawe National Park from here as a day-trip. You can also get to Kandy and back in a day, but it is a long journey. There are good locations for a river safari quite close. We had been on safaris on the Madu river several times before; this time we tried one along the Bentota river. We saw all sorts of wildlife, including crocodiles and snakes. If you are interested, ask Eranda, one of the tuk-tuk drivers usually waiting by the front gate, for a quote. His uncle Michael (you'll find him on the beach) is also a good choice if you are looking for somebody who can organise a trip for you. Thanks to everyone who made our holiday at the Heritance so memorable. We will certainly be back.",positive

We stayed at the hotel for ten days and from that stay we will most definitely remember great food and warmth of the people. We were in many places all over the world but by far the food served in that hotel was the best. That's mostly thanks to the amazing chef D.J. Manjula who not only takes care of the food but also entertains the guests.,positive
"We like to sit in the Coffee Shop and enjoy the nice view of the pool and the beach side. Last night, we did enjoy a very tasteful dinner,presented by our favorite R & B Supervisor,Mr Nuwan Sasanka de Silva,who's always very helpful and professional,a precious advisor and a charming person, we are very happy to meet,year after year. A special thank to him, for his wonderful way of making us feel at home, while at the Coffee Shop.",positive
"So it seems that even though we booked a 5⭐ hotel, we were unlucky to get the most outdated dirty rooms I've ever seen in such highly rated hotel. I always judge my room by the condition of the bathroom. The bathrooms here in both rooms were so dirty. The shower was the worst. The shower screen was completely covered by soap scum. The tiles were mouldy. Clearly the housekeeping had not heard of bleach or sugar soap or any kind of deep cleaning. Even run down hotels can be presented well with proper maintenance & care. These rooms don't deserve anymore than 3⭐ rating. Very disappointed. The food outlets however were fantastic. We dined at 3 outlets during our stay and each area was superb. Food was delicious. Best buffet food I've experienced this time in SL. The service was equally incredible. We travel with a toddler and we can demanding however the team made it so pleasant for us. Thanks you F&B team. Keep up the great work. You guys run a true 5⭐ rated Hotel restaurant. Message to the Heritance brand. High time you pay attention to the condition of your rooms rather than leveraging off the great locations your hotels are based at.",negative
"Our stay at this property was 9 nights during our holidays and we wouldn't have expected much from this hotel's overall experience if the grading system of this hotel was honest about being below a 4 star. Despite the general friendliness of staffs at the hotel, there is absolutely nothing to recommend about this hotel if you are expecting it to be a 5 star. From: - trying to put us in a lower category room (which we didnt book through Agoda) - bathroom amenities were never refilled and replaced - what 5 star hotel does 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner??? - room walls were made paper thin and it didnt help they placed us beside the housekeeping room and we heard every clamour there were starting from 7am every morning - bed sheets looked and felt like it was 30 years old from the stains and the lint built-up which was made to feel like climbing into rough potato sack fabric. - on the swimming/lounging private part of the property they allowed hagglers still on the property to haggle guests to buy products or their services. Overall, it should be reviewed how this property gets to be a 5star or be honest and lower the stars for what this property actually deserve which is no where near being a 5 star.",negative

"We visited this hotel for the new year, booked a ocean suite. The room was amazing with a spectacular view of the beach and sunset. The hotel buffet had a large selection of food and very well presented. The hotel staff friendly and nice however sometimes I felt like they gave more attention to the foreigners than the locals. Which was a little annoying. The Madu Ganga river cruise was quite nice. It is definitely recommended. It cost only 27USD. The only issue we had was the bathroom tub did not drain properly at all but after contacting housekeeping the issue was partially resolved. Overall the hotel is pretty decent.",positive
"Absolutely exceptional stay. We booked 3 nights here and stayed in a luxury suite unit 359. It well exceeded our expectations with space and amenities. The staff here are incredible. They Go above and beyond to fulfill your requests. All three themed dinners were tasty and there was always a broad selection of food for our large party of 15. Special thanks to chef Manjulla for taking care of our kids with chocolate pancakes for breakfast. The staff here work very hard and are happy to take care of you. We will certainly be back for another family reunion here. Many thanks to everyone at the hotel, from front desk to restaurants to cleaning staff. Couldn’t have asked for anything more.",positive
The resort is run very well. The staff is very courteous and speak English. The beach is very clean. The buffet is excellent! You will not go wrong if you make this a destination. Relax on the beach. The resort is only one to two hours from Columbo International airport. Make sure the driver knows where the resort is before you get into the van.,positive
"We spent 4 nights here and it was a sheer delight. The rooms were perfectly appointed and spacious. The rain showers were heavenly, the food fantastic, and service spot on. The hotel has 2 pools, one of which is reserved for in house guests. The trees surrounding it offer shade from the Sri Lankan sun and you can easily spend hours here without any worries of getting sun burnt. Breakfast was well thought out with a good selection of Sri Lankan, Indian and continental cuisine. Dinner too offered a reasonable spread of tasty food including seafood on some nights. The staff are well trained and seem happy to be working there. They were polite and genuinely made an effort to make our stay memorable. The only downside to this hotel is that the sea in front of the hotel can have rips and therefore not recommended for swimming. We compensated for this by driving to Hikkaduwa only 20 minutes away and swam there.",positive
"This is a decent hotel. Rooms were up to our expectation. I was personally very happy to find tennis courts, badminton courts, table tennis and pool facilities provided. Breakfast, lunch and dinner buffets had a wide variety of cuisine. However, there weren't much options for vegetarians :(",positive
"We were a group of 10 adults (couples) and this property was part of our itinerary. The minute we entered the property, we were in awe of it but thats it. Our problems began right from the word Go. Our check-in process took almost an hour which ideally should have been a 5 minute job since our passport copies and all details were with the agent and hotel. Post the checkin, our ordeal just began to rear its head. Of the 5 rooms we were provided, 3 of them were with twin beds when it was clear to the hotel that were were couples. Then further, of the 5 rooms, 2 of them were side corner rooms which were nowhere near the deluxe rooms as shown on the website. The plumbing and the lighting too wasn't in order. On asking for a room change, the manager on duty just told that this is all that is available. With absolutely no remorse on settling us for subpar rooms. This is surely not how a 5 star property treats its guests. Thank god I stayed just 1 night. The room service was pathetic and they took almost an hour to get to us since the mini bar was completely empty. What I liked about the property was the various activities, the food and the variety. I liked the proximity to the beach but I just hope the property gets their act together, have proper signboards on each floor and get better processes in place.",negative
"We were a group of 20 people in 10 rooms at Heritance Ahungulla for the new year. The service is absolutely the worst I have encountered across Asia. Staff in general are unhelpful and sometimes rude. The breakfast place is fine but the bar and snack place is absolutely terrible. We had to wait for almost an hour for a club sandwich and when asked three times they kept saying “2 minutes”. Finally when I approached a more senior person at the bar, he was totally unapologetic and asked the same waiter who said “yeah, I will get it”. This is one example amongst many incidents - from no towels in the pool to poorly made up rooms. I certainly do not recommend it - there are many other places in Sri Lanka that are far better.",negative
"We were a family of ten having booked five rooms in Heritance Ahungalla and were really looking forward to our stay after a long drive of Six hours from Nuwara Eliya. But right from check in it was a big disappointment, as check in itself took more than one hour. The rooms were not as expected of this property, the key didn’t work for one room, lights didn’t work in another room, the wash rooms were ancient looking with flush making scary sound in another room. The pass word for wife was outdated and had to be changed. The duty manager was not apologetic but showing his helplessness , arrogant and argumentative.The rooms were of different sizes and badly done up, never expected from Heritage Ahungalla.Instead of king size beds we were given single beds joined . It was a terrible experience stay and the worst of our trip of seven days in Sri Lanka. We will never recommend this hotel to any one. J P Alex and family.",negative

We spent 3 days around Christmas as a family. The beach is pristine and private and is a 2 minute walk from the room right across the pools. The rooms are large and airy with large bathrooms. The property has tennis courts etc to keep the youngsters busy. Food is just awesome and the Christmas Eve gala dinner had a spread so wide that one just cannot do justice. Staff are very helpful and efficient. We had no reasons to complain at all. An absolute pleasure,positive
We were welcomed with such love...from the time we arrived until we left we were treated like royalty. The kids felt like home...the staff wereore than attentive and accommodating. The food was excellent and we were even treated to special food upon request. The rooms are very clean and the houskeeping staff are very efficient. This must be rated more than a 5 star hotel. Overall the experience was very humbling and we were so blessed to meet amazing staff. I would recommend this hotel to everyone.,positive
"We had a great stay in this hotel, everything is perfect…The pools, food, and staff is amazing! Hope to come back and I will recommend for anyone …Lovely holiday and the direct access to beach is really wonderful!",positive
"We had a fantastic time at the Heritance Ahungalla hotel. The fresh fish was phenomenal, we ate under the stars and candlelight outside - a lovely atmosphere. Thank you to Chef Manjula for all of his help. The hotel staff were so welcoming and helpful. Highly recommend for some relaxation.",positive
"Room was nice, we had a pool/sea view, generous sized bathroom and the cleaning services were very good. Staff were friendly and polite. We booked on a bed and breakfast Vas us but ate dinner there too and there was always a good choice of food. On the last night we ate at the sea shack which is onsite and offers amazing sea food, we wished we had done this earlier as the food ( we had lobster) was fabulous. Lovely relaxing end to our holiday",positive
"We stayed two nights at this Landmark hotel designed by the iconic Geoffrey Bawa,Loved the food,the layout of the hotel and the staff was friendly and efficient. Even though the wooden interior of the rooms gave a homely and classic look and feel,it’s time for some refurbishment,specially the walls/bathroom and Corridor areas,the pool area was breathtaking and the Christmas decor was just wonderful. Had heard so much of this place for the longest time and wasn’t disappointed when we finally visited. Will visit again :)",positive
"Distinct architecture, management style, service quality of Heritance Ahungalla blends well with natural resources to offer an unique experience. One of the best beach hotels in Sri Lanka. Love this place!",positive
"We just arrived back from a week’s stay at the Heritance Ahungalla with my wife and two young kids. Really enjoyed our holiday and a great experience. Great hotel, very friendly and accommodating staff. Location is perfect, only a two hour transfer from the airport and right on one of the most beautiful beaches I’ve ever seen. Hotel food is also really good and plenty of places around the hotel if you wanted to venture out in a tuk tuk. Also a couple of great beach bars/restaurants within walking distance down the beach. Would definitely recommend and return to the hotel.",positive
A very nice hotel. Great service - food was OK. Very seculded place and no Lankeses allowed as it seemed. Very nice pool area. Calm peaceful. We had a great time here. Almost impossible to move by foot outside the hotel - there are so many people wanting something from you. Traffic was horrible. I guess this is the case in most smaller cities in SriLanka. Colombo was OK on this though.,positive
"One thing which makes Heritance Hotels stand out is the food and hospitality. So I had high expectations. I have already been to Kandalama and Negambo, in both cuisine and hospitality is great and flawless. The first thing I noted is that they (Heritance Ahungalla) cannot handle a crowd. No welcome drinks for some of the guests. Very few (sometimes none) food options to vegetarians. The restaurant space was not enough when crowded. Service is really bad at the restaurant. Several times we had to ask for water and wait for it. Both Negambo and Kandalama is excellent in service where they event do not let the water glass finish in any of the tables. So lot of improvement is needed. And it is noted that the service is delayed not because the staff is very busy, but because there are some idle staff as well. More organization is needed. Rooms are okay. The first day there were only one shower cap in the room. The other shower cap box is empty. On top of that, the second day, there were no soap. Even the soap from the previous day has been removed. Location is okay. Nice pools. If the main is crowded or sunny in the day you can use the other pools.",neutral
"It was a remarkable experience for my entire family, including my parents, my mother in law, my sister in law and my niece. although I and my family have been to Heritance Ahungalla before, it was the first experience of my other family members. we all had a wonderful time at Heritance. facilities and incomparable warm hospitality is highly appreciated by all. special thanks should be given to Srinath and Thushara for the wonderful support given to us which made our stay even more enjoyable. looking forward to visiting you all very soon. Cheers !",positive
On arrival GRO Hemashi greeted us with a pleasant smile. And then we were escorted to our rooms and from there onwards we all enjoyed the rest of the day. Thank you heritance for your great service. And not forgetting the food wow it was so delicious.,positive
Such a beautiful hotel with friendly staff. The lunch buffet was massive with a wide variety of food The rooms were really spacious and there were more than one swimming pools. Would definitely come back here again.,positive
"Working in the Hotel Industry myself, this is an experience I havent made before. I contacted the Hotel over 2 months ago, asking for an offer for a Family of 4 and myself for 4 days, Half Board. - used the Website mail: no answer - used the contact form: no answer - sent a mail to the Reservation department: no answer - Called the Hotel: was given another mail address: no answer - called again, persisted on the Reservation department directly: Reservation Agent (Trevin von Gunster) confirmed that he saw my mails from 10 days before, but was ´´too busy´´ to answer. - received an offer for 3 people, not 5, as requested - asked for a Change, over a week: no answer - called again: same person, apologies again, promised a new offer - receive a new confirmation, again for 3 adults, Kids missing - asked for a Change: since the 29th of November: no answer. I am trying since roughly 6 weeks to make a 2.500 Dollar booking, have spend hours and significant amounts on phone calls to Sri Lanka, have been kicked out of line repeatedly by the reception, have sent dozens of mails by now, and the result is: Zero. Absolutely astonishing.",negative
"Though it's described as a five-star resort, my parents and I were sorely disappointed by this hotel and will not be returning. The cons: 1. The receptionist offered us the opportunity to upgrade to full-board or half-board at a discount (USD30 instead of USD25 per meal). When we asked which restaurants this was applicable for, they said that it was only for the main restaurant, but failed to mention that it was ONLY valid for the buffet. If we had known, we wouldn't have signed up for two days of buffet-only meals. We found out because the waiter told us we couldn't have ala carte, and all of this happened after we'd paid for half-board for two days. In addition to not being told exactly what we were paying for, we discovered that the buffer cost LKR3,700 (USD24.2). So you're telling me that I didn't receive a discount--I'm actually paying the full cost of the buffet AND I'm locked in for a two-day commitment. This was dishonest on the hotel's part, and according to our travel agent, they shouldn't be directly giving us discounts--they're supposed to go through the agent. All in all, very poor form on the hotel's part. 2. On the morning of our check-out date, my bathroom didn't have water. I couldn't use the sink, I couldn't shower; it's a good thing I didn't have to flush anything. I checked my dad's room next door - also no water. It took two calls for housekeeping for the water to come back. How is this acceptable? 3. Our room had an odd smell that came from the bathroom drain. When we told the GRO, she said housekeeping would be around shortly to attend to it. They arrived 18 hours later. 4. When we first arrived, there was no porter to be found and we waited a solid few minutes before the receptionist noticed that we wanted to check in with our bags. He then rushed out and seemed very frazzled. Out of the 7 hotels we stayed in Sri Lanka, this was by far the poorest reception we'd received. The pros: 1. The restaurant staff were lovely, warm and attentive. My mum had a broken arm on this trip and the chef himself came out and helped her take food for the buffet and then walked her to her table. 2. They provide comfortable flip flops for guests to use on the beach and around the property. 3. The food was delicious. Every dish we had was delicious--both Sri Lankan and international fare.",negative
"We were there for two days ie 06 and 07 Dec. Let me objectively articulate the good thinga and things which needs improvement: Good ones 1. Well kept resort with private access to the beach 2. Huge open swimming pool which from the reception provides an illusion as if the pool is merging into the sea..a visual delight 3. Nice rooms with a balcony and I was told all rooms were sea facing Areas for improvement: 1. The access to the beach or otherwise ia uncontrolled ie no real security or barricade ..there were outsiders/ touts soliciting business and no one controlled them. 2. Most guests were Europeans and no wonder ..the entire menu was made to cater to their preferences barring a few local items 3. The menu for both dinner and breakfast practically remained unchanged thru our stay 4. Though the staff and chef were helpful, they probably had little clue about Indian dishes / ingredients/ taste. Despite their beat effort to provide one odd dish especially for us, the food experience was far from satisfactory. So if you are Indian and crave for Indian food ...this ia not the place for you. In contrast, all other places we stayed in SriLanka ie Kandy, Nuwara Eliya or Colombo, there were some Indian dishes on offer and some of them tasted good too. 4. Lastly , despite making a special request for cake/ flowers for our anniversary and reminding that very morning again, they messed it all up. Finally with the intervention of our travel agent they did bring a cake but by then the damage was done. It also gave me a feeling that they are probably still under slave mindset of licking the white skun. Thus on balance, 3 to 3.5 stars is what I will give",neutral
It is one of the best property I have visited.Best part of the property is the swimming pool facing the beautiful sea.while enjoying the pool you can see the beautiful sunset.Rooms are clean and spacious.Food spread is average for vegetarians.House keeping service is poor.The worst part of the room is its sharp edges glass top centre table just placed near the balcony which can gv you a sharp cut if not vigilant which I and my friends had.We will like to visit again this property.,positive
"as a returning guest i was impressed by the improvements at heritance , the refurbished rooms with the washrooms are much brighter also the food was much better this year, maybe the competition next door has helped in this, but the biggest star of the heritance is its staff Thushara, dinesh at the pool nimasha,chamichand thanks for the flowers each day Sodad , to name but a few but everyone made our stay very welcoming , great location on the beach ,good food , comfortable rooms, room 246 . 23/11 - 3/12",positive
the hotel staff were very welcoming and always had smiles! The renovated rooms were spacious and clean. The Sri Lankan food was quite good. Its a nice hotel to visit as there is direct access to the beach. Will recommend to friends!,positive
"Kindness and Smiles everywhere, despite the situations. Travelling with a wheelchair user In Sri Lanka has proven to be difficult due to decreased facilities available in most parts. During our 4 day stay at the Heritance, we were faced with wonderful members of staff who went above and beyond to make our stay as comfortable and accessible as possible. I cannot praise the restaurant staff enough, Executive Chef Chaluka, Supervisor Priyanga went out of their way to ensure that we were taken care off. They have a lovely attentive team working for them who made sure ramps where in place and food was served promptly. Due to adverse weather, we were offered a lovely upgrade for our safety, and staff where available 24 hours which when travelling with a disabled guest who has a lot of needs was a blessing. A beautiful main pool with beach access, and sun loungers everywhere, my only criticism would be to provide wheelchair accessible pathways on your lovely grounds, not just within the hotel building. Thank you for all your service. Will definitely come back if in the area Kresh and Family, UK",positive
"stylish hotel, a little tired in places but that adds to the charm. Lovely renovated rooms, lovely attentive staff, lovely sri lankan food in the buffet restaurant. Only about 150 rooms for such a large site, gives you room to stroll and find somewhere quiet when you need it. And what a great beach!!",positive
"Check in - Pretty easy. They have mistaken the booking, but they offered another lovey room and it was massive. But they handled their mistake smoothly. Room - Clean and nice! And it was really comfortable. They have long corridors that is acceptable because after a long walk you get a nice room and a lovely view. Rooms are spotless clean! Food - Nice. If you want to taste Sri Lankan cuisine in a big hotel, this is lovely place to go. Plus they have really coffee which is a big yes to me.",positive
I visited this hotel few months ago. Foods really good and love the rooms as well.but hotel staff only care about foreign customers .they don’t think about Sri Lankan customers . I don’t know why they are doing this for Sri Lankan but management should think about this otherwise you will lose Sri Lankan customers because of your staff . But hotel is very clean and rooms also. All the things are good. I will recommend your hotel to my friends for sure .,positive
"Huge hotel, but has a nice relaxed atmosphere and plenty of facilities to stop it becoming crowded. It has two enormous swimming pools which are immediately adjacent to the beach. The beach can be a frustrating place to spend time unfortunately, as there are a large number of pushy locals trying to talk you in to various activities (some clearly not legal!). The hotel provide security to stop them entering the hotel grounds though, so we preferred to spend more time around the pool areas. Incredible breakfast with just about everything you could ever want, including lots of really good local options (hoppers for breakfast were great!). The dinner options are good, too, and even has a separate seafood restaurant right by the beach which only serves fresh seafood. Our room overlooked the beach, was perfectly equipped and of a really good size. Without doubt the best hotel we stayed in in Sri Lanka (& we stayed in five others).",positive
"We came to this hotel for a couple of days of rest and sun at the end of a two week tour of Sri Lanka. I have to admit it was my least favourite hotel. Yes there was lots of opportunity for sunbathing around the pool. The men were very attentive with keeping the grounds immaculate and bringing mattresses and towels. Also the bars were located around the grounds so drink was easy to obtain. But despite this being a hotel designed to blend with nature, I found the stark long corridors austere and unfriendly, and very noisy. In fact they echoed any noise particularly in the early mornings. In the restaurant there were far fewer waiters than previously and those that were in attendance were much less attentive. And the entertainment was a mixed bag. We saw a delightful cultural show followed by a very amateurish fire show. Positives? Lovely large rooms. The quietest air con ever. Great range of food. Lovely location on a pristine beach.",negative
Have mixed feelings about this resort. Amazing team at the breakfast and dinner. The main cook went out of his way to offer us food that were not in thr menu. The main buffet for that night was maily chinese and we didnt want to eat chinese food in srilanka. HE WAS Very professional and asked us for food items we would like him to make for us! All the staff at the restaurant delivered 5 star experience. only if all the staff at the resort delivered similar experience. Main reception provided decent welcome. Pools were beautiful and service there was 4 star. Can't swim at this beach which is a disappointment. Cleaning staff did a great job overall. I would recommend this hotel for 2 night stay.,positive
"Attended a corporate Day-out with my family at this truly amazing hotel which has kept the uniqueness to the bit that ""Heritance"" concept has. Hotel has a well maintained lush greeny garden with a pond in middle at the entrance. Lobby was quite big and the most interesting catchy part of the hotel is the gigantic pool just above the lobby facing the sea with a view. It has that space for many to have their swims all over while looking at the sea next to it. Hotel has a few big inner gardens which we also occupied doing some games with the team. Rooms were up to the standard with balconies. My next favourite was the Lunch Buffet which has the finest and most delicious spread in the town. Staff was so helpful and looked into all your needs. Would recommend for a family visit and even for a corporate day-out plans with the space, quality and the superb service at this unique hotel.",positive
"I stayed in this hotel for 4th time still impressed with service, food & the atmosphere. We simply loved everything. The chef Manjula always wanted to provide what my kids wanted to eat & extend a great hospitality to all of us. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone. Further we cannot forget the help and support we always received from Mr Indika Gonawela (RM) at anytime when we are there.",positive
"Me and my mum wanted to spend some quality time together so we were heading for the usual yummy buffet when we were stopped by mr Munasinghe and offered the a la carte menu. I must admit going with his decision was the best . I wish I could rate it seven stars not five the food at this hotel is beyond comparison . We ordered soup , grilled lobster and baked cheese cake .... the food was fresh and delicious ...compliments to the chefs and the GM .. Munasinghe service is very very good ,and he is a asset to the hotel",positive
Had a lovely time on the beach! my room had a great view of the ocean and the pool design was nice. food was great and rooms were good. all services offered were very nice. I would love to come back to Sri Lanka!,positive
"Spent a week end in November (3rd-5th). Weather was not ideal for the season. Occupancy was about 75%. Intermittent rain but bright sun shine during the mornings. Sea bathing was not advised. The infinity pool and pool adjoining the bar was warm and inviting. Leisurely walks along the endless beach with warm white sands was most pleasurable. Coconut palms and lush foliage along the beach adds to the beauty of southern beaches in Sri Lanka, not seen in most countries. Heritance is an exotic location unmatched on the coast. The food ,service and simplicity of architecture is not easily rivaled. Star quality enviorenment. My stay was extremely pleasurable.",positive
"The four of us were enjoying our first evening at this hotel with a drink by the pool and soon found ourselves chatting with the Bar and the ""Upper Room"" Restaurant Manager, Rohana. Rohana was highly customer focused, engaging, interesting, funny and attentive in anticipating our needs. On every interaction with him over our three day stay he consistently provided excellent and friendly service, in particular, during a special dinner in the Upper Room restaurant to celebrate 3 birthdays and the end of our trip where he went out of his way to make it an extra special experience. We had stayed at several hotels during our trip around Sri Lanka and we particularly enjoyed the facilities and food here, however Rohana was the icing on the cake in making our stay at the Heritance Ahungalla a special one, thank you!",positive
"I visited Heritance Ahungalla first time 16 years ago and again 15 years ago (when it was still operated under the name Triton), so I was very excited to go back to the hotel to see if it still carried that adventurous atmosphere that it did 16 years ago. I was also vevry excited to see how they had renovated the hotel after the horrible tsunami that destroyed much of the hotel about 10 years ago. I remembered the hotel as a luxurious hotel with a very high standard both in the restaurant and in the small bars around the area where you could buy from a large snack menu. Many of these places were closed now to my disappointment. The hotel of course more or less looked the same and the beautiful architecture of Geoffrey Bawa - Sri Lankas world renowned architect - was of course still stunning. I should say that my previous visits was during the peak season in february where the weather on that part of the island is fantastic. This time I visited in october and we experienced several hours of heavy rain on several of the days we stayed there, and of course that adds to the experience and the atmosphere as they had to keep huge plastic curtains down at all times to keep the water from running into the reception area and the bar area. The hallways was flooded due to the heavy rain and the open design of the hotel so they had to keep staff constantly mopping up water and that was of course no fault of theirs. That's just how it is during this season. But something seemed changed. The hotel seemed to have lost that exclusivity that set it apart from other hotels in Ahugalla/Bentota region.15 years ago there were a wonderful atmosphere in the evenings with jazz band and dancing in the lounge next to the reception and pool area. This time around that was gone - much to our dismay. We also remembered that every afternoon there was a very nice complimentary afternoon tea with buttercake and scones that you could enjoy just next to the large pool but when we asked if they still had it noone even seemed to remember that they had it 15 years ago. We stayed in one of the huge suites with several rooms a seperate living room two bathrooms, a huge balcony overloooking the residents pool with a view of the ocean behind the row of palm trees along the coast line. I don't know if some of the changes to the design and decor was due to the tsunami 10 years ago (after I visited the last time), but I remembered the beautiful residents pool (the other pool that are closed to anyone but guests in the suites and rooms in the fine wing with ocean view, and it was originally made with the most beautiful dark blue tiles that made it one of the most beautiful pools I had ever seen. This time the tiles have been removed and the pool was just an ordinary pool with a normal lightblue surface on the sides and bottom and not made from tiles anymore, just like so many ordinary pools you see all over Sri Lanka. That was sad - I thought. I may have needed refurbishment or renovation but they should have stayed true to the original design with the beautiful dark blue tiles when repairing the pool instead of the cheaper solution, as this did something to make the place stand out in a way that it now doesn't anymore. They also had a wonderful original boat like the ones used by the original population in Sri Lanka that was a trademark of Triton (as it was once called) but they had done little to keep it maintained, so it had obviously deteriorated over the last decade so they hadn't saved it (unless of course it was taken by the tsunami ten years ago). To me it was just a little sad to se that on the patio where it was once standing proud in the middle of the large pool was now just an empty plate with nothing to decorate the otherwise elegant pool area around the public pool and bar area. Another thing that added to the impression they had lowered the standard since we last visited 15 years ago was the many families with screaming children running around the pool. 15 years ago there was a much more tranquil and serene atmosphere with adult guiests with a certain sense of etiquette, which includes preventing your children from running around the other quests at the pool and adressing strangers asking all sorts of questions instead of staying near their parents as they are supposed to when using the residents pool. What had since we last visited become a sad but necessary precaution was a several meters high fence between the hotel grounds and the beach where only a small opening heavily guarded by two guards at all times (day and night) was the only passage to the beach. In the old days one could just stroll down through the line of shady palm trees and reach the beach from anywhere along the hotel grounds. But it was obviously a necessary precaution as we could see that many more touts and beggars and people selling all sorts of ridiculous junk and overpriced sarons, were all over the beach. It even seemed to us as if some of these local hustlers had some corrupt arrangement with some of the guards as they sometimes happened to be inside the fence (which means they have passed the guards unattended), and even when guards saw them on hotel grounds contacting the guests, they did absolutely nothing or very little to stop them from intimidating the guests and/or even excort them from the grounds, which would of course be their duty. One of the nights I stood in the dark on my balcony outside our suite and I noticed a visibly drunk guard who could hardly wallk in a straight line talking a little with himself while he suddenly stopped near the tennis court and fumbled with his trouser until he mannaged to unzip his pants in the middle of the lawn and urinate. That latter I could even live with - I'm no prude - had he just walked behind a tree and taken care of business, but I didn't find the fact that he was visibly drunk very reassuring. The folloing nights I stayed for an hour on my balcony to see if the guard from the night before would return, would return, but much to my surprise I saw something very strange occur. One of the guards (not the same as the drunk guard from yesterday) suddenly turned on his torch and he waved it up and down and from side to sight while pointing it in the direction towards the edge of the hotel grounds. Shortly thereafter I saw two locals walking past the tennis courts and sitting just below my balcony between the building/wing and the tennis court. They couldn't see me as I kept the balcony lights off as well as the lights in the livingroom so I was hidden in the dark. I looked in astonishment as these very suspicious looking local people arrived and they opened small packages and presented them on the top of low walll surrounding the terrace belonging to the suite just below ours and the guards looked at the ""goods"" in the beam of their flashlight at what looked like small packages of either pot or very small portions of khat to me (I've only seen khat but nevver tried it so it could be something else, but I know that khat is very poular if you have a job where it's hard to stay awake and it's popular amongst lorry drivers etc. so I could imagine that a boring night shift would also tempt someone to use khat to keep from falling asleep as it is a mild energy booster that make that kan keep you awake and alert) and khat is actually not amongst forbidden substances in all countries (at least not in Europe), so the use of khat may even be legal in Sri Lanka, that I don't know. Well, that aside, the guards clearly counted and exchanged money for these ""goods"" in the dim light from their torch. Suddenly one of the guards heard me making a noise as I was taking a step back and he pointed the torch directly at my face and for a short while I was blinded, and they saw me on the balcony, so he turned off the torch and they exchanged a few hasty words with the locals who then wrapped up the rest of their goods and ran away along the tennis court and disappeared in the dark. This was in no way frightening or intimidating, but it just seemed like something that wouldn't have happened at the classy and stylish Triton of the old days, and it only contributed to the vague feeling that the standard of the hotel was not quite the same as it was 15 years ago. From the experiences above one would have thought that it was a horrible experience, so why do I give it four stars after all? Because they still provide many of the things they provided in the old days. We always live in large suites when we travel, so I have a large backlog of experiences to use as comparison, and I must say that the suite was wonderful. It was clean and beautifully furnished and the large balcony streched all the way around the suite and had access doors from all rooms in the suite. I will also like to give the place the benefit of the doubt, because many things were closed - and that might be because it is the low season in october, so my final judgment should not be made until I've tried the place again in the high season between medio january until medio march where the weather in the southwest part of the coast line of Sri Lanka has the most beautiful weather. We also dined at the a la carte restaurant (not the large dining hall, but Restaurant Mustard at the terrace on the left side of the reception area just after the reception desk around the corner). The food was delicious, the service was perfect, and the setting was cozy with a dimly lit area and a very romantic atmosphere. So taht was truly perfect. The in-room dining (room service) was also very good and arrived quickly. The breakfast was wonderful and came on time every morning exactly at the time we've put on the breakfast list to hang on the door before going to sleep. The staff couldn't do a better job. They were quick, courteous, smiling, polite and they didn't hover at any time or made certain trick to earn extra tips (such as coming two persons to a one man job, or staying in the room and keep asking if everything is to our satisfaction, etc. - you know the drill). But none from the staff we met did that at any time. Of course my wife and I both agree on giving a generous tip at no less than 20% of the bill every time something is served, so we allso made it easy for the staff not to hover, and that should perhaps be taken into consideration, but we also find that people in Sri Lanka live on extremely low wages, and compared to the prices in Denmark where we live, even an additional 20% still makes for a very cheap price for people living in Europe, Australia and North America, so i cost us so little but means so much to them, so there is no need to be a miserly cheapskate. If you can afford an expensive plane ticket and to stay in a somewhat pricey hotel like this you probably can also survive giving 500-1000 Rps ($3-$6 USD) more when tipping the waiter, room boy, luggage carriers, drivers, etc. It takes so little and being generous when tipping often comes back a thousand fold throughout your stay when you are being served by the grateful, hard working, staff at the hotel, trying to accomodate even your most extravagant wishes and habits.(That's just my personal opinion on this subject, and each to their own, of course). I believe all rooms are non-smoking but most rooms are with a balcony (or a terrace if at ground level) so this is a comfortable hotel for smokers.",negative
"Was here on a two night trip with the rest of my colleagues from office. Really not much to write home about. It didn't stand up to my expectations of a five star hotel. The staff was very courteous and helpful. There is no argument about that but the hotel infrastructure wasn't exactly that great. The car parks are somewhere way away that you have to rely on valet parking. This means you have to pick up every single thing you need from the vehicle before you check-in. The dining halls are pretty dark and gloomy, mostly I believe due to the dark colouring of the ceiling which is decorated with batik. The buffet area was really odd, it was almost like walking in to someone's kitchen to get the food served, the dining hall and the buffet area have very different vibes. The pool is good and well maintained and they do have some activity rooms where you could play 8-ball or carrom or chess. But the overall set up just put me off. Will not be returning here.",negative
"The hotel is visited by large groups and the long corridors can be noisy when these groups insist on having loud conversations or let their children run ‘wild’. It’s a large hotel and at times can feel impersonal although the design meant that it was not soulless. The ‘internal’ gardens were a nice touch. Staying B&B for 1 week Restaurants/Bars – a wide variety to cater for many nationalities but not inspiring or of particular high quality, it’s mass catering. Being only B&B I looked in on the main restaurant once in the evening and was not encouraged to eat there. I also looked at the a la carte restaurant and the sound of the menu was good but I like to eat local cuisine. We ate at the on-site fish grill twice and the food was tasty and cooked really well. I’m glad I didn’t stay all-inclusive as the food was not really inspiring – mass catering again and I’m not a big drinker. In the evenings, I often like a ‘quiet’ bar to read, chat or contemplate – only the main bar and coffee bar were open when I stayed, both in close proximity. There was evening entertainment (that’s a whole other story) in one bar area but because of the proximity was intrusive. Rooms – clean and well appointed Beds –two singles pushed together but comfortable and the bedding was clean & of good quality. Air con – I’m not a fan of air con but the room got very stuffy without AC running. It was quiet and effective. Intrusive piped music at 7 am!! And a similar time in the evening. Why? I forgot to feed this back to reception. Wifi was generally good throughout the rooms and grounds. Service - Nice friendly staff and seemed well trained and were generally effective. Beach / Security – The hotel is located right next to the beautiful beach although it is separated by a rather ugly chain link fence. There are plenty of security guards around and there seems to be an unwritten rule about letting the hawkers come about 20M onto the grounds. The guards sometime turn their backs and ‘allow’ the hawkers to encroach further. The hawkers are a pest and there are a constant stream often calling out to gain attention. If you sit around the pool rather than facing the ocean, you not be affected by them. We visited late October and because of the ocean currents you need to be a strong swimmer to go into the sea. The locals warned us that people had died. Pools are large and clean – I particularly liked having a guests’ only pool which was segregated from the public pool. Neither got particularly busy and the 8pm ‘curfew’ was well observed. The pool attendants, did a good job. Grounds – well maintained and extensive Tennis court surface was a disappointment but just fine for a knock about. I was very pleased to see sports equipment available and in good repair. Entertainment …hmmm There’s not a lot to see in Ahungalla itself but as a base for local attractions it’s good. Whenever we went roadside of the hotel we were followed, pursued, badgered, etc, by tour guides. A repeated ‘no’ did no good, a firm ‘no’ occasionally worked. We had to resort to a ‘just leave us alone!!’ a couple of times. My teenage daughter got a lot of attention and was made to feel quite uncomfortable on a couple of occasions, but this is not a reflection on the hotel in any way. The local children were more direct and just held their hands out bluntly asked for money and these experiences tainted our visit to Sri Lanka somewhat.",positive
Poor room condition. Very old bathroom and room. Need to get a renovation. But nice location. Nice pool and nice beach. We went there with our friends wedding anniversary. We enjoyed sea bath lot. It's really good experience for us. We enjoyed a Very quality and very tasty buffet. It was really delicious and more varieties. There was a sea food corner also.,neutral
"Nice location and good food. Pool is very nice and rooms needs to be improved, Doors are broken and no irons and toothbrush and stuff inside, have to call the room service and order all time, however the staff members are very friendly.",positive
"Heritance is a beautiful hotel with lovely views of the beach in front. We were upgraded to a deluxe room which was massive. The staff are very helpful and friendly, always happy to help you. Breakfast was a real highlight with a large selection of fresh fruit, breads, continental and traditional Sri Lankan breakfasts. The only downfall is that it is situated in quite a remote area with only a couple of restaurants outside the hotel nearby. However if you are going to be staying all inclusive, that is not an issue! Thanks to all the staff for an excellent stay!",positive
"Excellent welcome and a wonderful stay with all very helpful and friendly staff.Rooms were spacious,having the old look.The restaurant staff very helpful and asking whether theres anything we need.But i was not told when entering about the other section where the hot dishes were kept...other than that it was a perfect one day stay... In future would recommend to some extent have modernised rooms having the old look..,To have a baby pool,and to improve on the view from the balcony without just barely the pool...(Ex-Amari-Galle),In which i stayed the day after.Having something to seperate the pool from the beach would be essential,without the view of the sunset being disturbed.it was really disturbing to be on the beach where there were stray dogs all over. and also coming to the pool for water. Overall it was a perfect stay and would recommend family and friends for a peaceful relaxing stay....",positive
My stay in Ahungala was made great by fabulous Heritance Ahungala. The beauty of its location made us long for a longer stay. Our stay coincided with Christmas cake mixing event and that really brought the Christmas spirit ! Himasha and Mahesh kept us engaged with their updates and service.,positive
We spent amazing and wonderful time. Hotel stuff were very welcoming and nice. The facilities are really good including clean and very comfortable rooms. Pools were spectacular. Delicious foods was great buffet. Extremely hospitable and cozy.,positive
"So we went to the hotel to celebrate my mom's birthday and it's truly an architectural masterpiece it's simple yet sooo elegant and beautiful. With this also comes the fact that the level of activities in the hotel are quite less (personally I'd prefer some music when I'm dining or just chilling in the pool area) The hotel gives a warm welcome and the level of hospitality is absolutely high. The lunch was delicious each and every dish was so tasty yet we were very disappointed with how the evening tea was presented ,yes we came for the day package yet there was no proper place in which it was given and there was no place to sit and I was quite worried about the amount of flies setting on the butter cake. Overall everything was absolutely perfect just that the evening tea was abit clumsy.",neutral
"I only stayed for one night but it was a memorable and amazing .the staff welcomed us very nicely,the rooms were very clean. i don't have any thing negative to say about this place , there breakfast had a nice variety of food.",positive
"We ended our tour around Sri Lanka with a couple of nights at the Heritance Ahungalla. The hotel is well situated by the beach and we enjoyed walking along the shore watching the ocean roll in. We arrived with high expectations given all the five star reviews, but our experience did not live up to this. The bathroom in our room was disappointing for a 5 star hotel - small, bare plaster (not sure whether the room was being redecorated or this was the intended 'vibe') and the door wedged on the floor every time you tried to open it. The handle came off a drawer in the bedroom as the staff showed us the room when we checked in. On a positive note, breakfasts were buffet style with a very wide selection. Rather than accept the 'special offer' to upgrade to half board on arrival, we ate a la carte for dinners which meant we could choose what we wanted and this turned out to be much more cost effective than the half board offer/buffet. When we ate at the Mustard the place was very quiet, but we were rushed by the waiting staff - main courses arriving when we were half through our starters and left on the table, and dessert offered and our plates whipped away as we enjoyed the last mouthful of main course. Why the experience had to be rushed when the place was far from busy I don't know, perhaps the service could be most generously described as 'over eager'. This is a good hotel in a nice location. Staff were friendly. Just a few things which meant that our experience was not 5 star.",neutral
"We had a wonderful time at Heritance Ahungalla. Reception staff was excellent, very helpful, always with a smile and kind hearted, given us the most convenient room acording to our needs. Food was amazing, nice combination and delicious.thanks to the head chef and his team for giving us the most fabulous food ever . Staff was brilliant, always cheerful, helped us when we needed with lovely smile. We must give our special thanks to Priyanga, Sandali, chef Isuni, Thushara and the lady with the specs at the reception for the amazing service rendered to us. Entertainments was really joyful specialy Fire Bimbos. We have been several star hotels in UK,Europe and Sri Lanka ,but this was the best among compared to all. All the best . Keep the good work.",positive
Visited with my husband to Heritance and stayed one day there and had a memorable experience.Excellent hospitality Superb location and lovely food with great team spirit. No hesitation to recommend anyone who likes to visit this hotel and I must say it was a memorable stay.,positive
We came for a Vacation from Australia. Our initial plan was to stay only one night F/B. Once we walk in to the hotel it's very relaxing and welcome was very friendly. Food and customer service is excellent. Because if this we ave decided to extend the stay for another day. Special thanks goes to Nipun Sameera (F&B Ex) Thushara (R&B) Nelka - Excellent Sri Lankan tea.,positive
Visited Heritance Ahungalla for a day out with a day room. Superb location close to the beach and also had a nice big pool. The food was great. Room was clean and comfortable enough. Friendly staff. Can be recommended!,positive
"35 of us booked 20+ rooms for our high school reunion at Heritance sept 23rd to 26th ( people came from all over the world USA, Canada, Australia, NZ, SL, Vietnam, UK etc,,,). From check in to check out the service was 5 star+++, when the group arrived we were met by the GM Sisira and his front office manager and our rooms were ready didn't have to wait in line it took us less than 10 minutes to get all the rooms. The buffet had wide variety and the food was excellent, the dining room staff was fabulous. The rooms are nice big and clean with balcony and sea view. We had our Gala dinner on the 24th in a private banquet hall and the banquet hall was decorated beautifully like a wedding reception ( 20+ staff worked hard with a smile to make it nice) they had fire and candles by the entrance. We played cricket, volleyball, water polo and several indoor games. Their pool (3 of them) and the grounds are big nice and clean.... lots of room for everyone. Can't say enough good things about their staff and our stay. The entire team from their corporate office Thilini, their GM Sisira and his staff Gamini, Srinath, Chaminda, Priyanga and the rest of the staff were amazing. All of us had a great time. Thank You SR Sharva",positive
One of the best beach hotels in sri lanka with perfect qulity service. Nece spacious luxury room 355. Clean room. Restaurent service and variation of food perfect. Tasty food bit oily and spicy. Mr Thushara treated us well. Thanks to him a lot.,positive
"Our honeymoon went over all the expectations, and was truly unforgettable thanks to all the staff and hotel in general. When you walk in, you're already in love with nature, big pools, beauty of everything that you see. Great people are working in the hotel. Especially Tharindi. She was very helpful, always smiling and absolutely nice!!! Our room was great, always new design of flowers, and fresh fruit. We were very satisfied with out choice, and hopefully we will be back again!",positive
"Traveled with my wife last week. Overall, the service is excellent. The rooms were neat and tidy despite the fact that the hotel was operating at its full capacity during that weekend. Staff is very friendly and helpful. There are two pools in the hotel, one is exclusively for the residents. When coming to meals, we enjoyed both the breakfast and dinner buffets, which had a variety of dishes, both Sri Lankan and Western. My wife also had a mini treatment in the SPA and she was very happy with the staff and level of service. Even though the hotel has a nice beach, Swimming in the ocean is not allowed due to obvious safety concerns.Overall, a wonderful experience and we are hoping to come back :)",positive
"Overall quality and service were good with the unique layouts of the destination. Pool was quite amazing with the structure, clear water and also with a space for water polo. There were supportive staff but they should consider more about their varieties and selections of foods.",positive
"Just spent a week there following six nights at Jims farm villas. Very nice room and very helpful staff. Two great pools and hotel was right on the beach. Most guests in the hotel were German with a few British and Chinese guests. Food was buffet style so always something to suit could be found. The food was good but no more than that, it can't be easy catering for different tastes and large numbers. There is a separate fish restaurant (extra cost) great fresh fish - we had a Lobster and a local fish (can't recall what) and some large prawns together with a nice starter and a couple of beers for about £35 so you can't complain about the prices. We used this week to doss about the pool having done a week of sight seeing prior. Outside the hotel on the main drag it's not what you would call tourist friendly, there aren't the usual abundance of shops selling mementoes, you will get you own guide who latches on like a limpet as soon as you walk out of the gate trying to guide you into the stalls or local shops as we have been told they get a kick back from the shopkeepers. You will also get the local girls showing their clothing range on the perimeter of the hotel by the beach. Pretty entertaining but barter well if you want to buy.",positive
"After a two-week tour of Sri-Lanka it was lovely to relax and unwind in a luxury hotel. Our room was clean and comfortable with a nice balcony, unfortunately view of the beach was hidden by a large tree! Wasn't feeling very well during our stay so ordered room service. Great menu and huge portion sizes. Hotel also in a convenient location when sick because a pharmacy and shops located at the end of the driveway. :-)",positive
"Location , food and staff very good. Rooms very nice (especially if on ground floor leading straight to poolside) good choice of food. The only downside was not being able to swim in the sea due to monsoon conditions :-( tut tut to nearest swimming beach only 20 minutes away. Would recommend the local train to Galle ! Would like to say thank you to the attentive staff, and special thanks especially to NIROSH and DARSHANA who looked after us 😃",positive
"with my family we spent 5 days in the hotel , I booked B&B and then upgraded it to half- board , the hotel facilities are in good shape , clean rooms , excellent service , and continuous follow up on . food is excellent limited in terms of number of dishes but very good in quality / taste . make sure to book sea view room , I was not lucky to get one.",positive
"We spent 02 nights in this lovely seaside hotel. We found every aspect of this hotel, to be excellent. Rooms are nice and clean. Staff are very polite, helpful and attentive to details. Food was just great in terms of variety and taste. A special thank you to Mr. Lakshitha Salgado who upgraded us to a suite and 02 luxury rooms (due to the slight issue we had at the check-in, when sorting out the room allocation). Help from Chathura and Trilishya at the reception is much appreciated. I would definitely recommend this hotel and will come back again...",positive
"Every year when we're visiting Sri Lanka, Heritance Ahungalla is a must. With all the newer hotels around, Heritance has proved to be a very solid hotel and has never disappointed us. Accommodations, pools, and food is great and the service of the staff is exemplary. They are very attentive, helpful and never without a smile. With two young children, our family always has an awesome time there and will keep visiting. Thank you.",positive
I recently visited the hotel and it was a wonderfull hotel with all the facilities.Himasha from the staff is so helpfull and i had nothing to do myself because she was there whenever i had to talk to the hotel.I recommend this hotel as the best in the area,positive
Pros: Very nice seaside resort hotel. Clean comfortable rooms with excellent service by staff. Cons: Overpriced for the total experience. Buffet lacks variety of foods. Rough seas most of the times hence unable to go in.,neutral
"The rooms are a bit dated. Still on round pin plugs so adaptors are needed for all appliances in the room! Would be nice to have fluffier towels. Yet I think it I'd good value for money. Food is excellent as with all Heritance hotels. Location by the beach, the expansive pool, service is all great! Gym is very basic. Just one cross trainer and no treadmill . Certain,y the hotel is not plush but for the price it is pretty good.",positive
"I really enjoyed my stay here - the room was clean and comfortable, the breakfast was great and the location by the beach was lovely. The spa was also lovely and the treatments very relaxing. Only a couple of things let it down - mainly that the service wasn't as good as the other hotels we stayed in in Sri Lanka. There was an incredibly loud party going on in the room above us in the early hours of the morning and on calling reception to ask them to ask the people involved to stop, they didn't seem too bothered and didn't do much about it. There was also a very strange speaker in the bathroom which played music constantly and we couldn't find any controls to switch it off! Relaxing outside here was difficult as the chipmunks from the trees were constantly running around on sun loungers and we were pestered frequently by people trying to sell us things.",positive
"We stayed three nights in this beautiful hotel. The hotel is very nice and calm Room are excellent.Specealy food is excellent and f&b staff is very Frendly and attentive. Specialy nelka,pasan & nuwan are really helpful. Hope to visit this marwalas place again.",positive
"Staying here during low season has the benefit of fewer guests, which means the dining rooms, bars and pools are quiet. The sea is too rough to swim in until November but this hotel has two nice pools and plenty of entertainment if it rains (table tennis, badminton, games room etc) The buffet style dining room is well-laid out (I like the hot meals in an annex.) The food was pretty good and there was variety each evening - enough to cater for different dietary needs. However, I think it is a bit mean to charge for small bottles of water with your meal! There were a few issues with wifi when we stayed there - you get two passwords per room. If the weather was more consistent you could spend more than a few days here. The hotel is only an hour from Galle and just over two hours to Colombo on the highway. This is a good hotel for families or couples. The rooms are large and comfortable - great A/C and we had a room which had doors opening out into the garden and pool which was perfect. The bathrooms seemed recently updated. (There was a lot of noise above our room during the day as it seemed they were renovating or cleaning with heavy duty machinery - very noisy until 6pm.) if we had been staying longer we might have asked to have been moved! Overall a good experience!",positive
Located in a lovely place near beach. Very friendly staff. Excellent food. All 3 meals are buffet. Enjoyed every moment of stay. Two big pools with bars. Pool staff is bit rude.not very supportive. Great for a vacation.,positive
"Me and wife chose Heritance Ahungalla to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We stayed there for 2 nights and had an amazing stay. We had smooth, quick check in, even though we did check in the day that hotel staff had the family get-together. We got 2nd floor sea side room. We received a fruit basket and a cake to room ( ? Anniversary gift ). Room is well equipped. The hotel has 2 big swimming pools where you can relax. The beach is just in front of the hotel. Morning/evening walk on this clean beach is a must. Also hotel has table tennis,badminton and tennis court where you can enjoy a game with your partner. Also it has a gym, that we couldn't explore as we were busy with other activities. Throughout our stay we had buffet in main resturant for 3 meals, which were superb. Pool bar has lot of options. It has 2/3 restaurants, which we couldn't explore. They have different events organized every night and we experienced fire limbo and black and white show in our stay and they were superb. The gem store (premadasa) at the hotel is a must visit place. It has genuine gem stones for a reasonable price. Mr Ismile at there is superb. ( Yaa I had to buy a stone ring for my wife as she felt love with it ) Hotel offers lot of activities for guests and really you don't need to go out for anything. Altogether it was a superb stay for us. Yes, definitely we will return.",positive
Everything was so perfect nice view two big pools clean rooms.Staff is exceptionaly well trained restaurant staff is very well organized.we really enjoyed our two days.fire thing that had on tuesday night was so good we had so much fun.there were some nice games as well.only negative experience that i had was with the lady who make hoppers.she was so rude i greeted she did not greet back.i asked for a sweet hopper one with sugar in it she said cant only plain and egg hoppers available.then i asked for a treacle one she again said cant.she needs some customer service training.i ended up not having any hoppers.she was plain rude. Other than that everything was perfect.we loved it.,positive
"I visited heritance ahungalla with my office colleagues.Really nice hotel with nice pool.Fabulous foods and Room conditions was superb,and i really love room concept as well.but the staff not that much friendly.they must be very close with customers with nice smile.For local customers as well.Anyway i really enjoyed and i love heritance ahungalla. Definitely recommended!",positive
"The Heritance Ahungalla and Heritance Kandalama were both designed by the famous Geoffrey Bawa. The Ahungalla building is more conservative in design, but still displays a lovely aesthetic. We chose to stay at this hotel for the last four nights of a long tour, in order to simply enjoy some purely indulgent relaxation on-site. It did not disappoint, and we would be very happy to return. The highlights: - two fabulous swimming pools: a large 'infinity' pool, and a smaller pool which is somewhat secluded and beautifully landscaped. - the beach is immediately accessible for walks and for viewing the sunset. The sea is too rough for swimming, however. - Day trips are easily made possible to Galle fort, and Geoffrey Bawa's 'Lunuganga' (I should mention however that it is possible to arrange for hotels/residencies at both of these places). - the dinner buffet experience is fantastic, with a huge variety of delicious food to choose from. Excellent service. Warm, friendly staff. Recommended! :)",positive
"Enjoyed an amazing weekend here with family including 2 children - ages 4 and 6. Nothing was too much trouble for the dining room staff- we had half board and the food was brilliant. Every morning for breakfast a huge variety to choose from - 6 different Brekafast cereals, 8 different cool drinks, chefs on stations - eggs anyway you want hoppers, dhosa, idll, bacon, sausages, cold meats & cheese platters, huge selection of freshly made breads, doughnuts, danishes, cakes and fruit. Seriously a lot of fruit plus yoghurt and curd. Food is taken very seriously here. Saturday nights choice of evening meal was again amazing - freshly cooked giant king prawns, as many lobsters as you could manage, freshly grilled fish, chicken, kebab meat. We were truly spoilt for choice and even though there was a huge amount on offer, the chefs still cooked for my children anything they wanted for example plain chicken and chips. The dining room staff so very helpful and couldn't do enough. We meet the executive chefs too on the dining room floor and it was good to talk to them. Sat night also included ice-cream night which had a choice of I think 8 different quality ice-creams plus as many desserts as you can eat. Sri Lankan night on Friday meant freshly made oil cakes and lots of Vesak delicacies. We stayed in a lovely suite at a quieter end of the hotel which suited us at ground floor level which meant we could walk straight out to poolside.There are 2 generous sized pools we preferred the green pool as there was a large tree overhanging providing shade, also the hot tub is on this side. The shallowest depth is 127cm, so children need to bring water wings- can also be purchased easily roadside or from hotel gift shop. Both pools have pool side bars from which to order drinks. The hotel architecture is also really beautiful and it's a very pleasant place to stay. The beach is sandy but the sea too rough at this time of year for any swimming, but you can still jump waves. My children too young for evening entertainment but they enjoyed the live bands around the hotel on the way to and from dinner. The hotel also has a good wet weather plan with plenty of activities. We were close to the table tennis room, badminton and tennis courts. There is also a spa on site with lots of lovely sounding treatments, but sadly didn't get a chance to use it. To be honest we were either in the pool or eating! This is a fantastic hotel, all the staff we found were extremely polite and friendly.",positive
"The hotel needs improvement right from room allocation to Food and service. We were a groupof 27 people stayed there for 3 nights but rooms were allocated in all different corners, thou requested no one bothered to even take any efforts. Food was very monotonous for both breakfast and dinner On all three days , totally not exciting. . Staffs were polite but were on their own Sweet time and very laid back . Rooms are clean and well maintained .",neutral
"Heritance Ahungalla was our choice for a relaxing family beach holiday. On arrival our impression was not so good after seeing the car park with all disused items piled up. However, welcome drinks and hospitality from the staff at front desk compensated that. Our rooms were lovely and spacious and close to each other. However instead of a king size bed advertised and we had in our confirmation, we had two beds stuck together in our room. When we complained they said they will sort it out but all they did was put a bigger sheet covering both beds! Hence the 4* rating in the review. There are two outdoor pools. One is about 4ft deep and one end is deeper. This one has trees close by and hits a bit of shade during the day. The other pool is about 1m deep (one section is deeper) and great to be enjoyed with kids. The pool is huge and close to the sea. When you are in the pool it kind of give the feeling that the sea and the pool is just one. Food was very good both traditional Sri Lankan and Western foods were available for all meals. The beach (beautiful and clean) is just yards away and you can have peaceful walk in the morning. Unfortunately the sea was rough at the time we visited- hence we could only have a paddle. I would highly recommend this place.",positive
Great food & excellent service!!!! Recommended for family outings and for honeymooners. We would definitely visit again. Rooms are clean and classy. Saturday BBQ night was exceptional. Made our weekend heavenly...,positive
"I stayed here for just. one night on a G Adventures trip throughout Southern Sri Lanka, and I wish we had spent more nights here. This hotel was the best of my Sri Lanka trip. Comfortable beds, clean and spacious rooms with lots of natural light, a beautiful indoor/outdoor pool that looked out on the Indian Ocean, fast wifi, the BEST shower I had in Sri Lanka, and attentive staff. I do not stay in many luxury hotels, so I don't have much to compare this one to, but it was a wonderful stay and I wish I could have stayed longer!",positive
"I want to share my experience (no so good) at The Heritance Hotel Anugila. I along with my 2 sisters had made a booking for the 3 of us for 2 nights 17th and 18th August 2017 at The Heritance hotel Anugula. We checked-in the hotel on 17th Evening and were smoothly escorted to our room number 224. 1- On reaching the room we noticed that the floor was a little wet and asked for it to be cleaned with a delay of 5-10 minutes the floor was cleaned. 2- Tired of all the travel throughout the day, we thought of making some tea/coffee in the room, just to find that there were only 2 of all the things in the room. 2 cups, 2 glasses, 2 spoons etc. (for a room booked for 3). Why would the arrangements be for 2 when the booking is for 3??? 3- The electric kettle was placed in a cupboard which had no plug points. we had to shift the kettle to some other table to actually use it. But again to my surprise, the electric kettle plug (Flat pin) and the plug point (Round ones) in the room did not match. 4- My sister sat on the third bed to find out that the bed was actually not stable. If you sit on one side of it, it would lift up from the other. 5- We called up the rooms service for the above 3 points (2,3 and 4), but to my disappointment they could not have been slower. When you have a 5 star facility I would expect the staff to know English. The room service were not able to understand our plain English!! The room service addressed the plug problem, we made tea, and one of us had tea in a glass tumbler as there were only 3 cups in the room! 6- I went for a swim in the evening and came back to my room to take a shower. I land up in the bathroom to find out that there is no Shampoo or conditioner in the room!!! I call up the reception for the same and they tell me they will send it to my room. I wait for almost 15 mins no hear no knock on my door. In the end I had to take a shower without a shampoo or conditioner. 7- At dinner that night, my sisters were a little disappointed as there were not much veg options (they both are vegetarians). The chef was there taking feedback and my sisters told him the same. The next morning we were to go for an early whale watching trip and had to leave at 5.30 AM. We had already asked the reception to pack our breakfast. Previous night, while talking to the chef, my sisters told him that we would be leaving early and to pack good breakfast for 3 (2 veg (for my sisters) and 1 non veg (for me)). We woke up and were leaving for the trip. The reception handed over our breakfast nicely packed. We opened the packets around 10AM on our way back from the trip to find out 3 non-beg meals!!!!! My sisters could not have breakfast that morning, thanks to the chef’s goof-up! 8- We reached our room, called up the reception for shampoo and conditioner (Which were still not there in the room). The room service comes to the room with an unlabelled bottle and said that was shampoo. I asked for a hair conditioner and I am still in shock that he did not know what that was!! I explained what that was, and he said that they do not have a hair conditioner available!!! Believe me I am in shock as I write it!! 9- The day went on, we did not want to spoil our mood as we were on a 3 sisters vacation! But the next morning when we woke up, we found out that the entire room was dripping of water (see pictures attached). The room had always been wet throughout our stay (as found on check-in) but it started dripping literally next morning. We had our luggage placed on the table above which the ceiling was dripping! All our clothes were wet! We had to quickly move the luggage from there to the beds. And then there was no place to sit. I called up the room service to show them that, to hear a reply that we should not have the window open. We were in a sea facing room and were there to enjoy the sea, not to seal ourselves up in an AC room. That we do anyway at our offices when we are not on vacation. Why would you be in a sea facing room and not have the balcony or windows open?? I have not seen a beach side 5 star property of not having slippers or bathrobes in the room. I do not think these facilities should be provided on request. Isn’t it obvious that on a beach side resort the guests will go to the beach (or swimming pool) and would need slippers? Why should they have to ask for it?? Again still in shock - No conditioner!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! There are no plug points next to the bed!!!!! only 1 plug point far away fromt he bed. No multi-plugs available in the room. You have to call room service for that as well! We were in Sri-Lanka for a 7 day trip, stayed in all 4 star resorts. We wanted our last 2 days to be special and relaxing and hence we chose a 5 star. Our experience in all 4 star places was far better than these 2 last days! A Dissatisfied customer",negative
"We stayed at this hotel for a couple of days for a corporate outing / workshop and did enjoy the amenities. The food spread at the main restaurant was really good and we enjoyed all the varieties that were on offer. Easy access to beach and a nice pool too. Overall, nothing too fancy but a decent place for a day or two stay...",positive
"We were spoilt by the appearance and service of heritance kandalama and tea factory. We arrived and the hotel is a big resort as you'd expect. A bit weather battered but a high quality. The rooms are large and clean. Have everything we need. The service is slow and impersonal. Not what we had come to expect in Sri Lanka. There is little ambiance. The evening entertainment is unnecessary, keeping the bar open later would be better. The pools are great just note that you can only swim in the sea in Nov or Dec. It's really rough and dangerous at other times.",positive
"Front office reception staff specially Shanika was really friendly and helping us, food was delighted and so much of verities to enjoy The rooms are really clean and well arranged, room service is on time very friendly, special events were organized such as magic show, active performances really enjoyed in my stay.....So do not think go for it and enjoy your stay.....",positive

Specially I would like to thank Mr.Thushara (F and B Manager), I will definitely recommend and hopefully be back.",positive
"We spent the last 3 night of our honeymoon at Ahungalla and it was the perfect end to our journey. The room was big and the bathroom clean. We spent a lot of time in the pool by the restaurant which was spacious. The staff was very kind and helpful throughout our stay. Every night the chef would come to our table and make us anything we would want because we were a honeymoon couple. Also, the staff helped my wife plan a surprise 5 course meal on the beach for me which they executed perfectly. Thank you Ahungalla",positive
"We went as a family to spend a couple of days at the beach. It is convenient being just a couple of hours drive from Colombo. The pool was really nice, with views out to the ocean. The rooms are quite spacious and had little balconies from where you can see the ocean and even sunsets. Food was ok too though I wouldn't say exceptional. The staff were all very friendly and helpful.",positive
"I used to be very pleased with service and product. Today after 4 month I come again but the place has changed. Now be careful if your bill. A waiter asked me you know how many beer you have consumed, my answer yes; 3. Waiter no 4.well it is only 3 and this is fraud attempted by the staff. They had to admit that yes only 3 beer was served so why have this stupid discussion trying to make me pay for something not consumed. Very disappointed.",negative
"My son and i have spent 1 week in the Heritance Ahungalla. The 1st day was a bit complicated as i have bought the resort because there was a kids club and unfortunately, there was no kids club ! Despite this misundertsanding and the fact that i couldnt go to the gym or have time for myself, we had a great stay. The rooms are huge and because we stayed one week, we had few amenities on regular basis.. thx to our room attendant, Hashan, we had a different animal every day on our bed (made with towels)... my son wanted to be the first one to enter into the room and discover which animal it will be... Pool is huge and there is aquagym every day... there are even 2 pools, one closer to our rooms but deeper and with a jaccuzzi and the main one, where the activities and restaurants are... Tisharia in FO was the one who checked us in and she was very nice with my kid and all guests... very friendly staff and if you go on excursion, you can ask for an early breakfast... The food is very good, there are lot of waiters, always nice and friendly with us and the quality of the food is very good.. lot of choices, different themes evey day and a sri lanka corner, always different, food is very fresh, fruits are tasty, congrats to the chef and his team... Chamila,our waiter during the week was always friendly and smiling For the ones who like, there are musicians and/or dancers every evening, so you wont get bored. I had a massage the last day and my regret was that i should have done it earlier as i would have done more treatments...Nella, a balinaise lady was so amazing... strong and very efficient... and value for money is good, so try the spa when you arrive....not at the end.. Nice experience, sea is a bit rough is july but our guide told me that its ok between September to april.. Nice hotel, dont hesitate to book, but if you come with your kids, dont count on the kids club... it's the only regret... thank you to the Resident Manager and the team...",positive
We Spent a really relaxed and rejuvenating 2 nights / 3 days at Ahungalla early this month. A Big thank you to Mr Sisira Senaratne and his team for their hospitality extended to the 4 of us. Upgrade of 1 room to a suite was never expected. Both rooms were excellent and specious. We spent most of the time in the 2 pools. The food spread at all meals were quite appetizing. A special thanks to the Gardener who gave flowers each morning to my wife. Such a sweet gesture. This place is highly recommended to all.,positive
Happy about the service. Great customer service and clean atmosphere. Good foods and specially bar service is exelent. Had a great time. Enjoyed the time spent there and great pool area and the sports field.,positive
"The check in was very smooth. Was assigned to a room in the old wing which was very clean. The bathroom was very compact but did have one negative impact since it was party made out of glass and was covered with wooden blinds. This method is not very family friendly when it comes to privacy. The staff was very helpful when changing rooms when we were upgraded to a family suite which was ""AWESOME"" overlooking the GREEN POOL. As usual the Heritance Chain kept up to the standard when it came to the meals where you could find a massive variety and availability. However appreciate if activities for children and catered for since it was quite hard for us to keep the kids occupied and made it boring for them. All we could find was a GHOSTLY kids room. The beach was very clean, and was the only things which kept the children occupied other than the beach. Since the sea was a bit rough kid's couldn't get the full advantage. Last but not least I would like to bring up some thing, the only negative point is you must discuss at the time of check in about the child policy since I was asked about the ages of my kids at the time of check in (which were 6 & 11), in the end at the time of check out (mind you we had a Triple Full Board booking and prior read up of child policy of the hotel) were charged extra for the child, which I see is not professional. So it's advisable if you confirm prior to booking to avoid any unpleasant surprises.",neutral
"We had a pleasant stay at Heritance Ahungalla. Loved the atmosphere and the excellent service of the friendly staff . Went with kids and they attended to all our request ( kids meals , laundry , etc) without any hesitance . Keep up the good job and waiting for the next trip there.",positive
"It was a sudden decision and a quick getaway with my wife and the 3 year old. Well... the welcome was warm and pleasant, but I would say you could have been a lil bit more organized in the check in process, and that's something you can improve. The room was a deluxe and I would give five stars for that. The room was spacious and the wooden floors added an extra cosy atmosphere. Washrooms were small but I believe bigger washrooms were not the trend way back in 1981 when the hotel was established. There were a few minor problems with the cleanliness, but a sophisticated refurbishment would have corrected all wrongs. The pool was big and clean, but I would have appreciated a much shallower end and a baby pool. Need to mention the beautiful flute player at the pool. The dinner was OK... I would give 5/5 for the taste of food but the choice was just average. I would suggest a BBQ on a busy Friday night. The breakfast was again 5/5 and also a very rich variety. Check out was smooth.",positive
Wonderful atmosphere in the hotel and a have large pool. can go for a sea surf is it's not monsoon. Foods are delicious and specially the Saturday dinner is awesome. lot of live cooking's and had my favorite lobsters.,positive
My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. We had a complimentary fruit basket in our room. The rooms were clean and comfortable. View from the room was fantastic overlooking the ocean. Staff was exceptional. Spa amazing. You can enjoy two well laid out beautiful swimming pools and also the beach. Meals were very tasty with a wide choice.,positive
"Woww Paradise hotel, best service, everything perfect. Very delicious food, Excellent and friendly staff. Best place for honeymooners. Still sharing memories with family and friends. Definitely I will visit again.",positive
"Many times have we visited Heritance Ahungalle, previously known as Triton Ahungalle. This visit was to be with visiting friends, who attended a family wedding. The greatest part of this resort is the amazing placement of the pool, and the architecture of the Master of Sri Lanka, Bawa. Nothing will match this awe aspiring view of the sweeping water to the sea. The front office staff were polite and most helpful, especially Ms Shanika (?) who went out of her way to make sure we were comfortable. Thank you all ! We were disapointed that the food standards had dropped since our last visit, but the pool menu made up in some part, for snacks. It is an aging property, but special care is given to keep it good condition. My only criticism was the speed of the staff in the dining room, if we requested water or any small item, it took ages to arrive. This kind of service is in need of rapid attention, as guests sit waiting and waiting, and it feels as if you are forgotten ! The pool was spotless, the pool staff much more attentive than the inside staff. We love this place and will return again, in the hope that these small areas will receive the attention needed to revive its service. Thank you for a holiday that renewed memories of the years gone by....",positive
My husband and I stayed at the Heritance Ahungalla for your honeymoon. Could not wish for better accommodations for special week. We stayed in beautiful room overlooking one of the two pools. The food was excellent and was offered with such a variety that we never had a problem of eating the same thing. The staff was very friendly. Seriously loved it there and did not wanted to leave.,positive
"We were travelling in low season (june to july). Unfortunatelly swimming in the ocean was not possible. But because of the low seaon we had the hotel including the two pools nearly for our selves. And while relaxing in the pool, you have a breathtaking view of beach and ocean. It was en awesome stay with lots of beautiful and fascinating memories.",positive
Thanks to the staff of your esteemed hotel for finding & returning the lost gold pendant. The people I spoke with (Receptionist / Guest Relations Officer) were very kind and understanding in helping me with the recovery. This is a great service and restores my faith in mankind. A special thanks to bell boy (Anil) for his high integrity.,positive
We stayed in this wonderful place to spend our annual trip and we were treated as ambassadors. Wow. Excellent service from all over the resort with personal touch. Food was yummy. One of the key point to keep up the place unique is attentive staff. Keep up the good work guys.,positive
Wow superb place for a day out and the service of the receptionist are exceptional. Definitely I will visit again. Very delicious food and had an awesome time. Excellent and friendly staff. Recommend for any family or friends for a vacation.,positive

"What an excellent holiday we had, me and my family was welcome by the staff as if they knew us for a very long time. ever since then until we draw off saying goodbye after three days we wee looked after extremely well by the staff. the duty manager him self came and spoke to us many times and even cleared our table by him self. customized service according to my family requirement was very touching. Mr.Thushara took care of with an VVIP treatment and i have no words to thank him. A man who has tremendous talent in food and beverage knew what needs to be done according to the time and place to make his guest feel comfortable and welcome at all time. i sincerely hope the management recognized such staff in days to come.reception staff who had a smile, bell boy with a helping attitude whom we for got to tip to the housing keeping staff who cleaned the room twice a day and the list goes on. i wish them all the best and promise them that i'll visit them soon",positive

Very friendly staff ,Well Done guys & Gals Keep it up and keep momentum going . Except one matter (Communication between front office and head office very poor and trying to charge extra from us )I think this one of best hotels in Aitkenspence hotel chain in sri lanka.I recommend this place for anyone and hope visit again next year too..",positive
Visited the hotel after one year from my last visit. Blown away by the service and the hotel as a whole. Even on a low occupancy month they ensure the customer is treated with utmost care and given priority. Good job guys. Keep it up.,positive

"Beautiful hotel with the best staff. The reception is ready to assist you with anything you need. The food is mouthwatering and don't get me started on the deserts. The hotel threw a mermaid fire show, it was magical along with other many entertainments they provide. Being an animal lover I quiet enjoyed being surrounded by many animals around the hotel monkeys, squirrels. This experience is memorable and I look forward to coming back here in the future. I recommend this hotel to anyone wanting an unforgettable relaxing experience.",positive
"We came here to spend our summer holiday. Great hotel, lovely service, employees are very hospitable and willing to help. All in all a great experience. It was a good choice for us this holiday. Thank you.",positive
"We stayed here for a few nights over a long weekend and decided to go with the all inclusive package. Staff were very helpful and polite and happy to help you with any request you may have. There a two pool one at the entrance and another closer to the rooms which was very nice. One thing we did request was a king bed, and when we arrived in the room we found two singles.. we then informed staff that we would like a queen/King bed which they said they could do, as we were paying for that. We came back a little later to what we thought was a king bed, but they'd just put a big sheet over both beds and moved them together.. We were woken up both mornings too by people chatting in the hallways as they echo and noise travels but this is not the fault of the staff obviously. All in all, good package deal with all inclusive and staff are extremely helpful and always smiling! Would recommend staying here :)",positive
I stayed there for two nights and I had the best time ever. From the moment you arrive to leave they will look after you. The pools and beach were great. Rooms were lovely. Food was yummy. There's nothing negative about this place.,positive

"Red ants everywhere. In the room, in the bathroom. Even got into our luggage. The lobby is gorgeous but the room was full of sand. Not sure if they forgot to mop our room but it was very sandy. Food was not very impressive either. The one positive thing was that the hotel staff were very helpful after our son got sick in the restaurant. I am grateful for that. This hotel used to be wonderful. This trip however was sub par. Not sure we will be back.",negative

"I like this hotel, very nice hotel.everything was perfect. I would like to come back maybe next year🙂. The food was delicious. The pool was great. Very good and professional person. The destination was excellent.",positive
"The property is old and there was construction happening in the restaurant area. Only one restaurant was open during our stay and the Ala Carte had nothing much to write home about. The hotel does not have any facilities on the beach (no beach chairs etc.) and the beach seemed completely dry with very few tourists during our stay. Breakfast had a good range though. Rooms look old and the bathroom had strange blinds which did nothing for privacy. Not sure what I missed. Staff told me they get lot of German and Chinese tourists but I couldnt really imagine why anyone will choose to stay here rather than Bentota. Maybe during the season it is more vibrant, we unfortunately did not feel the vibrancy.",neutral
"We stayed for 10 nights at this hotel and every single one of them was perfect. Room: Spacious and clean. Plenty of storage space (we don't travel light!), very comfortable bed, great bathroom and the lighting in the room was excellent. Our room boy was extremely good. Thank you. x Restaurants and bars: The service was excellent. The waiters were so helpful and always with a smile and we had a good laugh with most of them. The food was outstanding especially when the Head Chef, Mr. Majula made us some special meals. He has won many culinary competitions and we can understand why. Also, we would like to mention Thushara Gnanarathna the Restaurant & Bar Manager for looking after us so well. We saw him at all meal times making sure everyone was happy. He does a splendid job. The bar waiters did an excellent job too and were so friendly. Sorry we can't name all the waiters but every one of them who looked after us did an excellent job. Thank you all. x Pools and beach: Brilliant. Plenty of sun loungers at both pools and in the garden and none of them were too close to each other. We stayed mainly by the Green Pool which is residents only and it was so relaxing. The beach is very wide and you could walk for miles. The sea was too rough to swim in but it was the Monsoon season. The pool attendants did a fantastic job and really looked after us. Thank you all. x Reception: The staff were very friendly and helpful and always with a smile. Also, we would like to mention the cashiers who were also very helpful. Thank you all. x Lastly, we would like to mention the lovely Himasha Guest Relations. She is a most delightful young lady who I am sure once she has finished her studies will do well in her career. We saw her each evening when we were dining and she would always come and have a chat with us and other guests. She does a splendid job. Thank you Himasha. xx Thank you all so much for making our stay a memorable one and we shall certainly return in the future.",positive
"Traveled with family on May 2017, well it was the rainy season, so not much luck enjoying the outdoors. Hotel was ok. the property is huge, well managed. Staff is friendly and attentive.

There was an issue with our Air conditioning during our stay in one of our rooms. they fixed it ASAP, Love the way the attend to the issues.",positive
"We have just spent 11 glorious days at the Heritance 5 star hotel to celebrate my wife's 60th birthday, many hotels claim 5 star the heritance is 100% 5 star with service which is second to none should it be the reception, bar staff, or the young man who cleans your room. I have been privileged to stay some great hotels all over the world if you want the best go to the Heritance you will not be disappointed, other hotels set your standards by this company and you will have many happy returning customers like us. Clarry and Caroline Dunn",positive
"Had a great stay at Heritance Ahungalla. Stayed there with friends and family. The property is nicely laid out with good rooms. Service in the hotel and restaurants was also great. The chefs in the restaurant were friendly and very helpful in arranging meals for kids. I know most people wouldn't visit the gym on a holiday, but I did and it wasn't in the best condition.",positive
"Heritance Ahungalla is a decent hotel with excellent staff. Stayed three nights with family and friends and the staff were always obliging and eager to please. They also work hard. The hotel was busy and it covers a big area and the staff were as busy as bees. But always good to the guests. Where I mark the hotel down is: a) The hotel is dated and looking very tired. I think one wing looked recently renovated, but the wing we stayed in, although clean, looked too tired. It badly needs an upgrade. A '5 star' should not be allowed to deteriorate to this extent before renovation b) It's a large hotel but surprisingly low on activities. As a result there is no 'wow' factor to justify the expensive rates. The beach is nice and it's a long stretch but the hotel is strangely lifeless and boring. As it is I would say this is a '4 star'. We had a nice time but there are so many options in Sri Lanka now and there isn't a good enough reason to return to this hotel.",neutral
"Had a very relaxing time at Heritence Ahungalla . We have upgraded to luxurious suite room . kids were really happy , awesome food and excellent service from the staff.

It's was the very first time we wanted to experience our stay in down south and we choose Heritance Ahungalla and it was the best choice.

"Our family recently visited to celebrate my brother's birthday and the staff helped to execute the surprise so perfectly! We even got the chance to see inside their state of the art kitchen, talk to the chef and see where all the culinary magic happened. Indian night was one of our favorite meals! Clean and comfortable accommodations. Fun activities like badminton, tennis, and table tennis. Of the two pools, the residence pool was our favorite due to relaxed and cosy vibes. The jacuzzi was a nice touch. The staff from the reception to servers and even the pool attendant were all so friendly and helpful. It was the courteous and attentive service that truly made our experience wonderful. Worthy mentions: Lakmini & Jacob at the Jute Restaurant. We have been visiting regularly for 3 years and this hotel has become our family's favorite getaway vacation spot.",positive
"My first trip to Srilanka with family. Overall it's been an excellent and fun filled holiday for my kids, wife n myself. Great hospitality showcased by my Lankan friends. Especially in Hotel Heritance Ahungalla Mr Darshan from F&B :) Regards, Pankaj Kadu",positive
My wife and myself recently returned after spending one night in the hotel. Welcome was friendly and we were quickly checked in to the room even though we arrived at the hotel earlier than the scheduled check-in. Room was specious and cozy with a king size bed. We were offered with an upstairs room over viewing the beach. It was a lovely experience to be there. Moreover hotel had had a full course buffet which included a vast spread and the food was simply amazing. And the staff is super friendly who took a greater care on my pregnant wife and always ready to go an extra mile to assist her. Must mention the support of Mr. Thushara Gnanarathna - Restaurant and Bar manager who is always around just to make his guests are enjoying the stay to the fullest!,positive
We visited there this Saturday with our office staff. We had a great day. Pool is very good to our kids. They also had sooo much fun. Thnx for Mr. Praveen of F&B for helping us on this occasion & giving us the special rate. Food is good. There were sm more items for vegetarians also. Thnx again.,positive

"I was there one night with my family & absolutely good place to visit again. I will never forget their foods, hospitality, room quality, environmental friendly location, quick service, smile of the in house staff, architecture, swimming pools etc. I was being in Heritance Kandalama before & this is the second Heritance experience of me. I have heard about the service of Heritance ahungalla from my colleagues. It is another reason to select this hotel as my next travel destination. I want to write a sentence about foods here. Foods are amazing & there is a big buffet in there. We enjoyed it lot & it is lovely place to visit again.",positive
"Just spent two wonderful weeks at this Hotel. We were on the all inclusive package and although we had some fears of this, we were surprised at the quality of of the food. Only two points per this Hotel down, why would Coke be on all inclusive, but diet Coke was not?? Also there was only a small space to eat outside, not everyone wants to eat inside! Would go again.",positive
"During our tours of the country, we had dropped in to this hotel as a family several times in passing over the years for lunch etc (excellent experiences) and finally took the opportunity to stay few nights this year. As always, the famous GB architecture in the reception area was fabulous, staff were very helpful courteous. There were some issues with the online booking system where the exact facilities in each type of room was not clear but the staff on the night managed to sort things out satisfactorily for us, even with the hotel being near full occupancy. The room we stayed in was clean and modern (appeared to be a recent refurbishment, the multi-socket wall powerpoints took in my overseas devices without the need for an adapter!), room service was good, Wi-Fi excellent, the gym smallish but adequate, pool & beach areas great and there were some good traditional outdoor displays/ activities during local New Year celebrations. Overall, a good experience & would be even better if the online system and a few minor maintenance needs were to be tidied up by the hotel group.",positive
"We spent the day there with my family. Hired a day room, used the pool had lunch and dinner. Had an amazing day. Food was lovely and the Restaurant and Bar Manager made sure we had a lovely time. Would definitely recommend.",positive
"This is my second experience at a Heritance. I absolutely loved every bit of the day. I visited this place with my besties for a spend the day. The hotel was magnificent and attractive. It has a nice view of the beach. And the food was amazing. The buffet was extremely satisfying, it was so delicious. We never missed any food item on the buffet. The pool adds more value to the whole experience and they have two gigantic pools. Me and my friends had a lovely time there. And I really appreciate the service also. The staff was really friendly and helpful. Hoping to visit Heritance Ahungalla again, and of course for a vacation.",positive
"I and my family visited Heritance and stayed for 2nights and 3 days.The service provided by the restaurant was great!Mr.Thusitha, main chef and the team made sure that we were provided with the best food and service. Their hospitality was amazing! My family and I normally travel and visit hotels in Sri Lanka but must say that they were extraordinary amazing!👍",positive
"Recently returned from a two week visit to Sri Lanka, staying mostly at the Heritance Ahungalla. The welcome was warm and friendly, with bags taken to the room quickly and efficiently. The room itself was clean, well decorated, cool and well equipped. We had a family suite, which had a bed big enough for an entire family!! Even though we had an additional single bed in the room, myself and my children shared the comfortable large bed and were very happy for the two weeks. The pools and poolside were cleaned daily. Sunbeds were easily acquired. We were in a group of 17 and found beds together every day we stayed around the pool. The quieter pool was slower for drinks, but ever so relaxing. The beach was breathtakingly beautiful. We weren't hassled at all. The current and waves were very strong during our stay, which meant swimming wasn't advised, however, we jumped and played in the waves which was lots of fun. All of the communal areas were kept clean and tidy. The lunch time menu at the bar was lovely. The chips and burgers were extremely yummy! Having booked on an all inclusive package, we used the one restaurant that was included for breakfast, occasional lunch and dinner every day. By the end of the first week, admittedly, this was a little monotonous. The food didn't vary very much from night to night, even though the chef did try to make it themed. However, the food was delicious and to a very high standard. It would have been nice to have a little more variety on offer though - perhaps in the way of a second restaurant/place to eat. Service for drinks in the restaurant was sporadic. Depending on the waiter, we could wait for around 15-20 minutes for drinks alone. We combatted this by building a rapport with one waiter, who after a few days, looked after us and would bring drinks quickly. The evening entertainment wasn't fantastic. And we found the evening's could drag a little. So be sure to take your own entertainment with you! While staying here, we attended a friends wedding. The wedding planner was very friendly, but failed to explain the traditions that the couple were undergoing in their service, which left them and the group confused. The hair and make up provided by the hotel were sufficient - although our bride did end up taking off the make up, as it was a little too much. The photographer was unobtrusive, yet quite dated in his approach. Even though these may sound quite negative, we couldn't fault the wedding itself, which was incredibly special to the couple and us as guests. The staff were so kind and helpful throughout. Overall, we were so pleased with our stay at the Heritance. All of the staff were happy and helpful. Everything was completed to a high standard. And yes, there were some aspects that could have made it even better, but overall, it's been a holiday of a lifetime. Would highly recommend a visit here!",positive
The food variety is magnificent the best I've seen out of the many hotels I've been to. I gave the 3 star rating just because how much i love the food and the creativity of the design in and outside the hotel. We called 3 times reporting in a technical issue in the room giving them 30-40 minute gaps but they didn't respond until we decided to yell at them. As usual we were given the room 45 minutes late. And is asked to leave right on time. The bed was okay but isnt the most comfortable. Staff is friendly and helpful . Loved that fact which is why I wouldn't wanna rate this any lower. Its a good place but could be better for this price,neutral
"We have just arrived home from a 2 week stay at this fantastic hotel and already we want to go back. we chose this hotel for our wedding destination and couldn't have picked a more beautiful place. The service we received from the hotel and the wedding planner was excellent she was just fantastic! Gerald was a brilliant rep very helpful and didn't push any excursions. Both our suite and our guests rooms were brilliant spacious, clean with excellent views. The food was lovely and the kitchen spotless, service can sometimes be a little slow however we have to give a mention to Darshana when he was working service was excellent and he even remembered all 17 of our orders and kept our drinks topped up nicely!! sun loungers were nicely spaced out around the pool and gardens so you didn't feel like you were in a sardine can and everyday we manged to get 17 together so finding a space is not a problem. Sri Lanka is one of the best countries i have ever been to fantastic country, fantastic hotel, fantastic holiday!",positive
We stayed 1nights with our family last year. No words to say about foods and it was fabulous. They have given us room upgrade as well. But there is Night club also when we went there there was not crowd. But we enjoyed well. I hope i would visit to this place again.,positive
"We spent 3 weeks in Sri Lanka and stayed in 12 hotels and this we ranked last at number 12. On arrival our room was not ready despite it had gone 14:00. We were told this was due to a late check out and we were made to wait at reception without any offer of a refreshment. We reserved a table for evening food and upon arriving at the reserved time the table had been given to another group. We received phone calls on both mornings waking us up. One was at 07:30 regarding some washing being ready for us despite not having any done. The laundry department were insistent it was ours and then Hung up when we told them it was not. When we tried to speak to management we had to ask three times and after 10hrs we got to speak to a manager. They heard our complaint and offered half price food for the evening as a good will gesture. The buffet was on par with other hotels and the restaurant food was very good. Unfortunately despite the managers efforts at departure time we were phoned regarding when to collect our bags. We asked for 10 minutes time which they said they could do. After 25 minutes we walked our own luggage to reception and left the hotel in the same style we arrived, little to no service. During our visit some of the facilities were shut despite the hotel supposedly being fully booked. The room was fine and clean but the communal areas looked tired and not what was expected from a 4 Star hotel. The restaurants lacked soul and character. Due to our experience I can not recommend this hotel and I would question the awards and endorsements it has. I hope that others receive better service than we did given the price.

"We stayed at this hotel for one night (half board) as part of a tour and was lucky enough to be upgraded from a standard room to the best room in the hotel. Our room was 359 and was absolutely amazing - could not fault a thing. The room was huge was a separate lounge area, stunning bathroom with a jacuzzi, 2 vanities and walk in shower plus a very very large patio/verandah area. The hotel is located on the beach and also offered 2 pools and free wi-fi. What let the hotel down was the service in the public areas. We decided to go to the coffee lounge for coffee and cake when we arrived. Finally found a staff member where we asked for a menu which wasn't forthcoming. I eventually played a game of 20 questions and placed a coffee/cake order. It took quite a while to arrive which was surprising. I eventually realised that the 'coffee lounge' actually doesn't have a coffee machine and it was made at a bar at the other end of the hotel. Very odd. Friends of ours staying there also had the same experience albeit separately. At dinner time we had the same experience with lack of service. The staff were doing the best they could but definitely required more staff on the floor. They were extremely busy and just couldn't cope with the numbers they had. I saw one poor waiter being slammed by a Chinese customer and having to apologise profusely. There wasn't so much pressure on the staff at breakfast time but the service was still a little poor considering the numbers in the restaurant. I really wanted to give this hotel a 5 as the facilities deserved it. Unfortunately the lack of service staff prevented me from doing that.",positive
"If you're visiting Sri Lanka and want to get the tropical island experience, this is the place for you. Or if you're local and want to get away from the daily stress of life; this place is the ideal place. First thing you'll notice when entering to the hotel is its unique exotic exterior and interior architecture. And you'll find the friendliest , top notch staff catering to your every need. And if you're kind the person to enjoy the beach and waters; consider yourself entertained. Excellent food, clean rooms with wifi and all the things just to suit for your needs The whole experience I had visiting there was a spiritual one.",positive
"We stayed here for 4 nights having travelled around the southern part of the island. We stayed in a refurbished room room which was large and appealing. The patio doors opened directly on to a private patio and was about 10 paces from the second of the two swimming pools. It was a quiet hotel with access on to a beautiful, wide sandy beach. We used to walk on it as often as possible and paddle in the water which was always warm. There was no hassle from Hawkers whilst we were there and very few people were ever on the beach. The restaurant was buffet style and had a varied choice although the service in there was slow; it was oftens the case that we would be half way through our meal before we were offered a drink and even then we had one occasion where the drinks didn't arrive (I had read about slow service in previous Tripadvisor reviews). There was a family of monkeys which appeared daily around the hotel trees and would sit on the roof which everyone liked, they didn't cause any problems and provided everyone with a photo opportunity! We used the laundry service which was efficient and very cheap and also the currency exchange; this was also ok but they would not change the rupees back to sterling on the day of our departure so that is something to bear in mind as we had quite a lot that we ended up having to try and spend at the airport just to get rid of it. All in all a pleasant stay.",positive
"Trip was off to a rocky start when they assigned my parents' tour group to some rooms far away. The group was made up of 65-85 year olds and the rooms that they put them in were terrible. In order to get to the room you had to go to the second floor walk three minutes and then walk down the stairs to get to the room. There was no elevator access, which was troublesome for some of the folks and the room patios were directly next to the restaurant and there was construction happening in the spa. If you can, I would avoid rooms 101-105 and opt for an upper floor view. That being said, the next night they rectified the situation and switched the unhappy folks to different rooms. The pool view is picturesque and beautiful, and the beach access is extremely convenient from the hotel. There were hardly any people on the beach. The most redeeming quality about the hotel is the wonderfully kind and talented executive chef, Chef DJ Manjula. He checks in with the guests as you're walking around the buffet, and graciously offered to make an off-menu course: steak and mashed potatoes which was the best dish I've eaten in Sri Lanka. It's no surprise when I learned that he's a decorated chef that's won many cooking competitions. Thank you Chef Manjulla!",positive
"Just got back from what you call a weekend in Paradise ..having experienced the beautiful beach , an infinite pool , delicious cuisine and most importantly the warmth of the staff. Heritance Ahungalle is the place to be for an assured great time and attention to your individual needs.",positive
"Visited a while ago and the hotel and grounds are beautiful, right on the stunning beach. Staff were delightful. There is nothing outside the hotel apart from the local village so you have to eat in the hotel or the one beach bar. Perfect for a lazy holiday but if you want to venture out you will need a car!",positive
The rooms were very well presented and comfortable with decent sheets and towels and overlooking a great pool. Only a short stroll from a great beach and didn't feel overcrowded. Decent food and great staff,positive
"Every so often even the mighty falter. What matters is recovery. After an impressive check-in, things went south at dinner. Inattentive service, cold food and total apathy left me wondering if this was the wrong place to spend three nights. I usually provide feedback at the end of my stay, but this bothered me enough that I penned an email to the corporate office that very evening. I did not expect a quick response. The next morning, with a fair amount of trepidation, I went for breakfast and was pleasantly surprised when a staff member approached me and apologized for the unpleasant experience the evening before. Before long another two managers stopped by to offer their apology. The balance of my stay was perfect. This property is beautiful. I was fortunate enough to get a room with an incredible view. The accommodations were comfortable and technologically up to date. The pool is huge and strategically located within 10 meters of the beach. I was on a half board plan and had the breakfast and dinner buffets during my stay. Good selection as well as taste. One of the days I ate lunch in one of the restaurants that offers a la carte service. I asked the chef to prepare lobster Sri Lankan style and it was absolutely delightful. All in all an excellent place for holiday in the Galle district.",negative
We viaited this place back in 2013. Choose this place last minute as this place foe selected for office trip but change later. But i wanted to go this place and decided to go here. It was correct decision. They got lovely pool. Food was nice. Staff was very friendly. Once they realise that we come there for my son's second birthay they arranged a samll birthday cake. It was very thoughtful. We appriciated a lot. Nice sourrounding . Can give a 5 star without any hasitation.,positive
"Beautiful hotel, great sprawling property right on the beach. As soon as you enter the reception you are greeted by a pool and just a short distance from the pool is the beach! That''s the awesome sight that welcomes you... The beach is beautiful and pristine and few people are around, making it a wonderful place for those who do not like crowded places. The hotel staff were very helpful and hospitable. The food could have been a bit better though and the dinner buffet could do with some more options. But overall an amazing place.",positive
"I previously stayed here when it was the Triton 19 years ago. It was stunning back then ,and it's still just the perfect place to be. All of the staff our smiling ,friendly The view of the beach and sea is 2nd none. I have 3 more days left and i know i will be back.",positive
Substantial renovated 3 story complex on the beach. Large area of beach front. Huge pools. Lovely sitting areas with natural shade. Extensive smorgasbord meals of local and western food. Choice of additional restuarants. The building Survived the tsunami with no loss of life. Very good service. Rooms large and well furnished with sea views. Aust couple on tour with Travellanka.,positive
"Me and my family were there on April 1st to 2nd. It was a great time for me after a long time. It was really worth while for us for our pay. We stayed for all 3 different buffets and all of them were varying to each. Lovely,yummy food.. My child is 2 years and 4 months old and they were covering them as well in their menu. She also enjoyed a lot.There were 2 pools and both are really good. Room also nicely set up and very luxurious.Staff is really good, polite and provided a nice service to us in all the ways. I recommend this place to anybody for a great vacation with delicious food.",positive
"Five night stay following our tour and a well appreciated rest. Rooms clean facilities good lovely setting amazing beach. Staff mostly helpful and friendly. We went on a half board basis would advise going full board as drinks and food expensive. Plenty of choice in main dining room at night but sadly lacking in atmosphere felt more like a canteen, staff not very attentive more often than not you would be left with all your Crockery on your table until you vacated it.Trying to gain the attention of the waiters/waitresses was often a challenge to try to get a drink or even a cup of coffee. Beverley Hewitt, London",positive
It was a great one night stay. The staff was very good and service levels were excellent. Attention to detail was good. The food was very tasty. Thushara and his staff was very hospitable and always checked if we were enjoying our stay. Will certainly visit again soon.,positive
"Heritance Ahungalla is very quite hotel as it's away from the main road. I join with my company colleguess, It's easy to find your own quite space around the beautiful grounds. We played outdoor events, such as Volleyball, cricket. The pools are really nice and clean. The buffet was amazing with different curries offered every day. I enjoy the breakfast buffet since it provide lot of Sri Lankan traditional foods, such as Hopers, string hoppers, Milk Rice with Lunu Miris. I enjoy the lunch too, but my point of view Dinner wasn't that much tasty. They have delicious range of desserts and starters. The rooms are comfortable and the service was quick and awesome. Staff was friendly and efficient. I really enjoy my stay at Heritance Ahungalla. It was truly and amazing experience since I'm a beach lover.",positive
"Hotel caters for all needs. Food somewhat expensive as per many high end hotels in Sri Lanka. Look at prices and then add 25% for service charge , vat and city tax. The buffet dinner was a highlight for us and one of the best we have ever had. Chef Manjula produced a fabulous range of seafood options plus a wide variety of Sri Lankan and western dishes to suit all tastes. I love Sri Lankan dishes however the other 3 in our party not so much......we all agree it was one of the best buffets that we have experienced in our travels",positive
We were having a short break with an extended family. Refreshing welcome drink on arrival was perfect after a long journey. My sister had a beautiful room with a balcony( some kind of a suite room) Very friendly staff in all areas of the hotel Plenty of space out side we even managed to play cricket to make our stay unforgettable,positive
"This is a traditional hotel set right on the beach with a colonial feel. We booked a deluxe double room and it was very spacious and well furnished with very comfortable beds. A good bathroom with rain shower and plenty of storage for clothes etc. The room service was excellent even on a night someone would call round asking if you needed fresh towels or a tidy up. All the staff at the hotel from the gardeners to the management were friendly and helpful smiley people. The food was very varied and excellent quality with the traditional curries which were delicious plus a variety of other foods with every taste catered for. On our last night Chef Manjula came out and offered to cook us a special dinner as it was our last dinner at the hotel. We said we would be very happy with what was on offer. My partner mentioned how good the food had been and he had especially enjoyed the prawns (which were griddled huge and succulent). When going to make his choice of dinner the Chef was stood at the griddle and gave both my Partner and myself a great plateful of beautiful prawns. After we had finished he appeared with a plate of fresh mango each to finish. He even wanted to go and get us some ice cream which we refused as we were full to bursting! The grounds to the hotel are beautiful with trees and an abundance of birds and wildlife including chippmonks and lizards also monkeys in the trees which were very amusing to watch. A lovely infinity pool and another more natural pool. It made for a very nice atmosphere as everyone wasn't crowded round the one pool and the wooden sunbeds were scattered through the gardens for a more peaceful time. I would like to mention Dennis the Pool Attendant at the quite pool. He went the extra mile to accomodate everyone. With fresh towels, matteresses, moving of sunbeds and always with a big smile. As I mentioned before, all the staff were exceptional. The beach is lovely, miles of golden sand. The sea was often rough with big breakers and a strong under-current so it is not an ideal place to swim but it was great for a splash about in the waves. All in all a brillant place to stay and I was very sad to leave.",positive
"We had our annual planning workshop @ Heritance Ahungalla and all the staff members provided us an excellent service. Food, environment and the hospitable services of the staff members made us the session very meaningful and productive. Special thanks to Shivanka from Aitken Spense head office and Gamini and Gayathri from Heritance Ahungalla.",positive
"We stayed at the Heritance Ahungalla for our honeymoon and were not disappointed. Having done our research we liked the more traditional style, location and hotel size from looking at reviews on TripAdvisor. This is a beautiful hotel, very clean with some fantastic staff. I did unfortunately injure myself while we were there but the staff were very caring and attentive. The food was very good and there was a good variety although it was unusual that not all the restaurants were included as part of the all-inclusive and wine only available at meal times. Our room was beautiful and we had a stunning view of the beach which was right on our doorstep. The only piece of criticism I would have, would be that the walkways and grounds could do with a little more manicuring between the two pools as this looked a bit untidy. All in all we had an amazing stay and I would recommend this hotel. Sri Lanka as a country is beautiful with an abundance of exotic wildlife, culture and some of the friendliest people you will ever meet. This was certainly a memorable destination for our honeymoon, different from anywhere I have ever been and we would love to go back and explore more.",positive
"I have being to many hotels in Sri Lanka, by far this is the best hotel i can recommend. Food is great and staff is friendly. Pool area & beach is great. From arrival to checkout the experience was great.",positive
Everything about this hotel is first class. From the comfortable and stylish rooms to the great food to the warm helpful staff. Thank you to Chef Manjula who was attentive to the quality of food and opinions of diners who consistently produced excellent tasty dishes and also his lovely staff In particular Shan and Dumidu.,positive
"We were there for 11 days. It was wonderful time for us. Had some problems in room, but manager assistant Nihal helped us a lot, thanks! Very happy Heritance Ahungalla has such a good people working there. Tasty food. Very polite and smiling little girls meets you at the entrance to place of meal.))) Very beautiful nature in the hotel and around it. If wonna go some trip - try to find Amal, the great guide and our friend now) So try to be happy from the first day to the and of your vacation! We will miss you Heritance Ahungalla.",positive
"My wife and I spent the last two weeks of January here. The hotel is very nice, clean and the staff are attentive and helpful. The food in the buffet restaurant was OK.... nothing too special, but they try to cater for all tastes. We booked B&B only as we prefer not to be 'tied' to the same place for meals. However, outside the hotel, there is little choice along the beach. Only the 'sunshine bar' at the far Right as you look at the sea. The food there is simple, but very good and very reasonable. We eat at the 'Mustard' restaurant as well as the 'Fine Dining' restaurant that is within the hotel grounds. The food at both was very good, but because most of the guests were 'All Inclusive' and eat at the buffet, we dined alone in the other restaurants. I did have a bit of an issue with one of the 'room boys' though. The one we had at the start of our holiday was very attentive and made sure he told us each day that 'he was our room boy' (obviously after a tip at the end of the holiday). But he disappeared halfway through our time there. So, when we finally came to pack our bags, we gave our tip to the room boy that took over. However, as we walked with our cases to the lift, we were approached by the original room boy who made it obvious that he wanted a tip also. But we had already given our last Rupees away, so had nothing left. It was a cringingly embarrassing moment, which I didn't feel we should have been put in. I've seen comments here about the 'beach sellers' ... Our experience was nothing but good. I got friendly with a middle aged man called Pathmi, (usually wears a Red baseball cap and carries a Red Sri-Lanka tourism bag) He took me and his Nephew on a fishing trip in the mangroves. It was great. He also invited me back to his house, where his wife had cooked a 1.5kilo fish, potatoes, rice and curry sauce for lunch.... It was a real honour to go into his house as well as humbling..... So please look out for him on the beach. He's a real 'find'! If you are looking for a hotel that can provide good, clean accommodation, as well as good food and are happy to more or less stay around the hotel/beach area... this is a great place! If you are looking for a hotel, but would like to walk along the beach to find different restaurants, then look again. There's none there! (apart from 1)",positive
"We arrived at the Heritance Ahungalla at 9pm yesterday evening after a long journey from the States. We were told that the rooms we had booked and paid for were no longer available. This is a small boutique style hotel. They solution was to send us next door to a large all inclusive party resort We contacted Agoda who booked the room and failed to notify us it was cancelled. They offered a 15% discount. Big deal, we had already lost our first day of a three day visit getting bounced around and treated like a bad disease. Escalation within Agoda was requested but ignored. Instead we got an email congratulating themselves on how well they did resolving our issue. Heritance management were worse and could only blame Agoda for not telling us they would not honour a fully paid reservation. Bottom line, do not trust doing business with these two shysters.",negative
This hotel was very nice and pleasant. The beach was remarkable and the food was very good. I will definitely come again! If there is a place that you want to have that is very peaceful where the staff treat you with respect and humility than this is it.,positive
"For the sixth time we returned to this hotel. Everytime we go to Sri Lanka we must stop here to check if the familiar, friendly atmosphere and the good food still are there. And it is, always. The Geoffrey Bawa building is in need of renovation but they are planning for that next year, good. They have alredy started with a few room but more to come. The crew take very well care of the guests and you fell comfortable all the time. Special thanks to Thushara and Gamini for spoiling us, chef Manjula for very nice food.",positive
"An amazing property, one of the few hotels that have a large buffet, spacious rooms, plenty of garden space for outdoor activities,what is significant about this hotel is, its Typical Sri Lankan hospitality!",positive
"We got married at the Heritance at the end of February and it was a fantastic stay. The hotel staff were helpful, especially Himasha in guest relations and Thilini our wedding coordinator. The wedding was simple but beautiful and just as we wanted. The hotel itself is stylish and the two rooms we had (we were upgraded after the wedding) were beautifully decorated, well equipped and relaxing. One minor thing is that housekeeping staff need to learn that if the red light is on the door they should not disturb - they had a habit of knocking to turn down the room just as we were showering for dinner every evening! The food was great - by far the best I've ever had in an all inclusive buffet style restaurant. We also ate in the fine dining restaurant twice which was also great. All in all, a stylish, relaxing resort that felt very intimate. Highly recommended.",positive
"It's wonderful place to just wander. We were very happy with the room, the service, and the restaurant. The staff was great with our 1 year old, who was equally happy exploring the grounds and pool and beach. But the thing that really blew me away was the incredible building, designed by the great Geoffrey Bawa. It really makes this hotel a destination in itself.",positive
"A longish trip from Colombo Airport was worth the journey. Although the hotel was full for part of our stay it never seemed overcrowded and there was always plenty of room around the pools, with no difficulty in finding sunbeds. We used the smaller of the two pools, the green pool, which was always quieter and the three pool boys were always very friendly and helpful. The buffet restaurant had plenty of choice for all meals although a little more western food at times would have been good. However the Head Chef and his deputy were always around and made it clear that, if you wanted anything else to eat it would not be a problem. We took them up on this offer at times and were not disappointed. There is a small 'Fine Dining' restaurant at extra cost but it was not really worth the money. The rooms are all of good size, mostly overlooking the sea, and most (but not all) have recently been refurbished. Rooms overlooking the green pool are the quietist. There is some limited evening entertainment but it is not up to much, not that it worried us at all. All the staff are extremely helpful and friendly. Most of the guests tend to be British or German (but still no problem in getting sun beds !). The long sandy beach is always uncluttered and like a picture postcard - wonderful. Best to go 'all inclusive' as there are not many other restaurants/shacks about that are easy to get to.",positive
"This place is worth the stay alone for the amazing architecture! The rooms are beautiful, although the satellite connection for TV was a little spotty at best. Not a setback though as the pools and beach are enough of a distraction. The buffets serve adequate food with enough variety. Lovely stay",positive
"I spent a holiday at Heritance with my friends. Best thing in the Heritance is pool which opens to the beach. Its an amazing view and really refreshing mind. the buffet had a variety of dishes and all are tasty. But I felt that the hotel has gone down in some areas such as maintenance. The major minus point is the unclean bathrooms, ponds and entrance. Overall a very enjoyable stay. Lovely service..",positive
"The hotel gave a marvelous first apearance as we entered and saw a large swimming pool that was beautified with the view of a sandy beach shading the brilliant blue water. Everything was perfect till we approached the reception. We informed the receptionist that we made our reservation through a voucher we recieved. The receptionist firstly told to sit and wait while having the welcome drink. I dont mean to be fussy but i expected a small hi or hello. A personal note of welcome, something to the tone of. ""Welcome to the heritance."" ""nice to meet you."" What happened just seemed a quick cut off. I realized while waiting for the room key suprisingly that everyone was greeted the same way. Quick. Were they busy? I was not sure. Or maybe they must have been informed to act accordingly. After that though i must say things just kept going uphill. When i went back to the receptionist I realized she was a very nice person and not only her all those that were at the counter seemed very professional from then on. My voucher was for a standard delux room but very very kindly i was uped to a luxury room. The room was huge. two queen beds, a 50 inch TV, bathroom had a big bathtub with a seperate cieling shower. My bags were brought up to my room. A man whom i think was named Dinesh/ Danesh was warm and exceptionally proficent throughout the trip aquanted himself to us as we entered the room. Then ofcourse the beach was beautifu,l the buffets were really good. lunch, dinner and breakfast. The A'la carte menu was not so impressive and the food compared to the buffet was not exceptional infact the chicken asparagous soup was not of a 5 star hotel standard. Overall I would definitely come here again and again and I thoroughly enjoyed myself. They have a lot of activities that can be done on their premises ranging from Tennis, badminton, volleyball, table tennis, ofcourse a gym and did I mention they have two large swimming pools. I might have missed a few. This was just in the top of my head March was a good time to go and if you stuck with me and patiently read the whole review. Then there's nothing more to do but book your tickets, pack your bags and go for it.",positive
"Decided to spend a holiday at Heritance with my family and friends, based on the excellent experience I had there during a corporate get away. Although I felt that the hotel has gone down in some areas such as maintenance and room quality, it was still a very enjoyable experience. The pluses: Spacious rooms. Excellent F&B. The fresh salmon starter for lunch was one of the best I've had in SL in a long time. The buffet for dinner and b'fast had a variety of dishes and the beli juice was a lovely surprise. Great facilities. The main pool opens up to the beach. We enjoyed the second pool that some what hidden away, and looks like a natural pond with the over hanging trees. The minus points- The bathroom was rather cramped. Some of the furniture and equipment could use refurbishment/replacing. Overall a very enjoyable stay. Lovely service and F&B.",positive
"A classic Geoffrey Bawa designed hotel, low rise, on a beautiful beach, with plenty of space to relax. Gradually being refurbished, it's main strength is the quality of the well trained and charming staff, who looked immaculate at all times. It never felt busy even when full. Ahungalla is on the west of the island, about one hour north of Galle, and 20 minutes south of Bentota. Two hour transfer from the airport by taxi. We opted for the 'All Inclusive' package, which we felt was good value. We are pleased we did as the dining options outside of the hotel are limited if you are staying for a couple of weeks. The main restaurant is buffet style, but with a full team of chefs constantly cooking fresh dishes. Mostly local (spicy) dishes, but with plenty of European style dishes. The food we would describe as 'very good'. Breakfast good. There is also a 'fine dining' restaurant where we ate twice, but as guests of the hotel. All inclusive drinks are somewhat restricted in choice, but suited us fine. Wine only available in the restaurant, and only by the glass. This is not a hotel that encourages over indulgence, and that, for us, is a good thing. If you want 'wholesale drinking' (as it was described to us!) go to the Riu next door. The hotel is gradually being refurbished, we were allocated a refurbished 'Luxury' room, which was very comfortable and large (almost 600sq ft). Wifi (free) in the hotel was very good, extending to all areas, right out to the beach. The beach itself is a few km long, beautiful, and pretty much deserted. The current, however, is very strong, and it's not ideal for sea swimming, although if you walk to the southern end of the beach it's fine. All in all, a rather nice hotel, and we enjoyed our two week stay",positive
"Whenever,we plan for a trip to relax,and enjoy with the family,the only place that comes to the head is,Heritance Ahungalla,for the magnificent view at the entrance,the service that CANNOT be MATCHED and of course the great taste of the food.Their way of entertaining the guests are simply remarkable.the lovely music after dinner at the lobby area with the breathtaking view of the ocean and the pool,and the dance acts of their staff give us the relaxation of a lifetime.we would sincerely like to thank Mr.Thushara,(the restaurant manager) and the staff for the splendid service offered as usual.A very special thank you for Mr.Thushara for making our stay wonderful, everytime.Thank you so much.",positive
"Located right off a huge stretch of private and almost deserted beach. The resort is very quiet and chill which is an amazing, relaxed end to our Sri Lankan trip. We were even upgraded to a suite with a nice view of the ocean. Breakfast and dinner spread is huge - they have themed nights so guests will not get tired of the same food every night. Most of all, the staff are very nice and friendly - the birthday cake they got me was a nice touch! Thank you Heritance team!",positive
"Probably the best restaurant in Ahungalla. The waiter is very polite, efficient and superb service. As I live in the area I will definitely come have dinner again. For travelers I recomend that you at least one time have lunch or dinner at this hotel. The pool is also good.",positive
"Excellent location and beach. Hotel is a fantastic design. Great food and the majority of the staff are really friendly. Unfortunately however, although the management have repeated on a number of occasions that the renovations have been completed, they are far from complete. We did have a look at some of the rooms that had been renovated and they looked excellent. Unfortunately, we weren't in one of these, our room was extremely dated, the cleaning was not done to a very high standard and we don't think the balcony had ever been cleaned! We used the pool furthest from reception which was excellent, with well-kept lawns. The major problem here is that there are only 8 umbrellas, unless you want to sit under the trees, we we didn't. I always sit under an umbrella and my wife always sits in the the sun but the problem is that the pool boy reserves the beds/umbrella's for those that have tipped him previously which then involved us having to have an argument with him most mornings to get a place with an umbrella - on some days there were 2 or 3 umbrella's/sun chairs that he had reserved but there weren't used all day as the guests must have gone out for the day, but he wouldn't let anyone sit on them! The main pool at reception area is excellent although the surrounding lawn areas are extremely scruffy. Overall had an enjoyable holiday and stay at this hotel but the room we stayed in wasn't up to standard. Stayed first 2 weeks in Feb 2017.",neutral
"Large hotel well off the main road on a fairly small beach. Beautiful pool area, good breakfast although the stations were widely spread out. Excellent service by housekeeping staff. All were helpful and friendly. Beach was clean.",positive
"The location on the beach is great, calm and scenic, close to the water. The hotel pool area is good and quite high level of service around the pool. Some days the pool area was not so quite that we had expected. Layout of the hotel is fine but it need some updating and I understand it will take place in April this year. Communication among staff was non existing, service quite low if you rate yourself as a 5 star hotel, which it is not compared to international standard. The food did not live up to a 5 star hotel standard, medium quality to quite high rates. Breakfast was rather chaotic and serice level among staff low. It seemed as staff wanted to delivery a good service but did not know how. Only on the very last day they checked in and ask how it was and if we were satisfied. Shops in the hotel area were very boring and expensive and far from 5 star hotel standard, recommend to either close or improve a lot. Wil go back to Sri Lanka but will chose antoher place to stay.",neutral
"The staff are so friendly, comfy rooms, superb pools, lovely beach and overall its a great hotel in a nice environment. The food was not that great and very less dessert varieties. The washroom in the day room has transparent glasses and broken mat curtains so it was quite uncomfortable with friends in the room. So we had to use the washroom with the lights off..",neutral
"hotel is well designed , the public areas open onto the beach fronting the Indian Ocean. Staff were friendly and attentive . Choice of food was excellent . Overall , a memorable stay …. wish it could have been longer .",positive
We were staying at the RIU next door but as they could not do anything special for our silver wedding anniversary the Reps from our hotel organised for us to have a meal at this hotel on the beach it was AMAZING it did cots about £200 but was so very worth it and made our special day even more memorable. thank you Heritance hotel,positive
"I booked myself in for a week to relax and this place didn't disappoint. This place is huge, rooms are clean and large. The service is excellent. The grounds are the perfect place to relax - 2 pools, both very clean and it's easy to get a comfy sun lounger. The food was very nice and cuisines ranged from local Sri Lankan to international including european and chinese. I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to visit Sri Lanka.",positive
We had a great time. Perfect location. Beautiful beach. Good food with lot of variety. Helpful efficient staff. Spacious clean rooms. Two big pools. What more do you want when you are on holiday.......,positive
"My mum and me stayed for 2 weeks in the hotel and had such a wonderful time we will definitely never forget. Everything was just perfect.. the food amazing delicious, the rooms perfect clean and most of all the staff were fantastic. Very lovely caring and friendly.. you never had to ask for someting as they somehow knew what you needed:) very warm thanks especially to sandali and jagath who just know how to make a great service.. we miss the lovely smalltalks with you.. another thanks to indrajith our housekeeper who made a great job and had a feeling for details and lovely decorations:) thanks to the whole staff, please keep it up! We will sure be back and miss you a lot. Greetings from Germany and Switzerland;)",positive
"My wife has Coeliac (celiac) disease and is unable to eat any food with gluten in it. We made this known to the hotel when we arrived and we were soon put in contact with the member of staff with overall responsibility for the bars and restaurants. He was knowledgeable, fully aware of the disease (as were all the senior staff and chefs) and informed the member of staff in charge of the restaurant we would use (Dayal) of our needs. We could not have had a better service from the staff, we were met as soon as we went into the buffet restaurant and a chef took us through what was suitable for my wife to eat. They also cooked food specially for her e.g. grilled prawns or fish if they were being prepared in batter, a chicken curry, at lunchtime if we had chips they were cooked in fresh oil, gluten free bread baked freshly at breakfast and in the evening. The chefs went out of their way to be helpful and I understand the hotel is going to expand the number of gluten free dishes they regularly offer, including more sweets. All the local curries on offer are GF and we ate those regularly - they were excellent and each evening there were new ones to try. I can't emphasise enough how well we were looked after by the staff. The hotel was opened in 1981, designed by Geoffrey Bawa, the most famous Sri Lanka architect. It is a most interesting building built in the colonial style with many period features. It is well worth spending some time looking round and appreciating the many detailed touches that make the hotel different from many modern white soulless hotels that seem to be springing up everywhere. The pools are excellent and the view from the main lobby is stunning. It is next to the sea but shielded from view by palm trees so it is only glimpsed as you walk down the beautiful beach. There are many naturally shady areas in the grassed grounds and plenty of sunbeds. The hotel has 150 rooms and they are being modernised without losing their period charm. We stayed for 2 weeks and although the hotel was often full in the evenings there was never too many people around the pools probably because some groups only stayed overnight. By adjusting eating times is was easy to avoid the busiest times in the restaurants and they continually refreshed the food so late arrivals weren't having leftovers. I would advise people to have a minimum of half board (which we had) because the hotel is isolated. There are a few shops by the entrance but there didn't seem to be many places to eat outside the hotel. Prices. Beer 650ml and cocktails were about £4 each. Soft drinks less. Wine in the restaurant was expensive, over £30 a bottle but they will keep an opened bottle for you. Lunchtime snacks; fish and chips or burger and chips about £4 On all inclusive you only have free wine with a meal and some soft drinks appeared to be randomly chargeable, otherwise all is included as far as I could tell. All the staff were friendly, helpful and conscientious. They have a cashier where you can change currency and get a supply of 50 and 100 notes for tipping.",positive
"Efficient Staff . Especially The Most friendly and helpful GRE ever ""Thilini Tennakoon"". Everything about the hotel was Exceptional. I was very pleased with my stay, And I hope to be back for a longer visit in the future.",positive
We had 4 nights here at the end of a tour and it was by far the worst of the hotels we had stayed at. No problem with the room (though our friends managed to get their room booked out whilst they were in it!) but the service on two nights in the Coffee Shop and the Upper Dining was VERY slow. Added to this was the meat when it arrived after 90 minutes (!) in our meal at the Upper (Fine) Dining was overcooked in part and a lump of fat for the duck! This was very disappointing as we had been introduced to the company's head chef at a previous hotel. The Jade restaurant (buffet) was good both for dinner and breakfast though.,negative
"I took Mum to Sri Lanka arriving on boxing day and leaving on 15 January. The hotel is situated on a lovely beach and you can go in the sea but it is advised not to go swimming as the undercurrent is very strong. If you walk to the north of the beach near the White Villa Resort, the sea is a little calmer and you can have a great sundowner on the beach at Berty's Sunshine Restaurant! The hotel has two great pools - one is for residents only and was our preferred area for most of the time that we were there. The staff at Ahungalla Residence are lovely, very dedicated and try to assist with any query - they are without doubt the hotels's greatest asset. Although all were great, we would like to thank in particular: Gayathri - restaurant and bar at resident's pool - such a lovely lady, Dumido at the restaurant - very kind and attentive, Gussup at the resident's bar and pool - such a lovely man, Nirosh in the main poolside bar - so helpful and always smiling and of course the lovely Sarath who organised sun beds every day with no complaint and always very efficient!!! We were at the hotel for New Year and the effort made by the staff was enormous. There was very good entertainment organised despite very heavy rainfall in the days prior to New Year (they were building a boat for the festivities) and the atmosphere on the night was perfect. The Chef (Mr Manzulo) and his catering team in particular excelled themselves with a buffet fit for royalty with ice sculptures and the most delicate cakes and puddings decorated beautifully. I would definitely go to this hotel again for New Year. The food was very good throughout our stay and there is always Sri Lankan food available, which was always excellent. If you ask for items at the bar that are included in your all inclusive package, you still have to sign for them, which can become a little tedious but I am sure they have their reasons - just check the bills though as we were presented invoices for many drinks that we had not ordered at all!! The northern part of the hotel has been painted and refurbished and is around the residents pool - this is a very relaxing part of the hotel. We stayed in rooms above the kitchen and although they were acceptable, the trolleys going up and down could wake you up (perhaps they could use trolleys with better wheels to eliminate noise?). We stayed at the hotel for 3 weeks and they told us that we could change rooms but in the end we did not. However, if we stayed again we would prefer rooms around the residents pool - I know some people prefer the rooms at the south and so it probably depends on the preference of each guest. We had no complaints about the inside of the rooms in any case. The paving slabs near the poolside bar do need some attention as they are uneven - we tripped on these and saw so many other people tripping (this was a worry for Mum). Having said this, most of the hotel is well cared for and maintained. There is one point to mention that actually is not the hotel's direct fault though I believe they should be aware of it.There is a very aggressive tour seller on the beach who seems to target this hotel and he can be relentless with his pursuit of guests. We experienced this ourselves and also were aware that other guests were finding this was making their stay less pleasurable than it otherwise would have been. We went on one tour with him at the beginning of our stay to the rain forest but found him and his partner to be unprofessional (taking us to places that belonged to their family with no prior warning of turning off track, stopping on route with no explanation to do their own business, more expensive than other tour operators etc). So we decided not to use him again. However, he continued to harass and it was even impossible to walk along the beach without him following at one point, which made Mum who is 74 very uneasy. He even asked another guest to approach us while we sunbathing at the residents pool to ask us if we wanted to go on a river trip. We and this guest thought this was very strange in a luxury hotel! We used tour operators at Berty's Sunshine bar and we found them most professional and we actually extended our stay in Sri Lanka for a tour through Yala and Candy with them. Just before we left, the beach tour operator challenged us on the beach and told us that he was most disappointed in our decision to use Sunshine as they were more expensive than others. We told him that we liked them very much and that in fact they were cheaper than him. Mum and I have travelled the world together and appreciate that people need to make a living and we try to always support the local population. So I mention this only because if Mum had come here on her own, I am certain that this would have made her go home early and certainly she would not have returned. She told me that she felt threatened and found this particular man to be ""predatory"". We know that many Sri Lankans can be very direct but this is a great shame as we visited many other beaches, towns, villages, cities in Sri Lanka and did not have any similar problems whatsoever - it is of concern that some people employed by the hotel are recommending using this tour operator. We certainly do not and this type of attitude is not helping this hotel at all!! Having said this, do not be put off going here - from what we saw in Sri Lanka, this is a very, very good hotel but do not be intimidated by the beach tour seller!!!",positive
"The hotel staff was very friendly. We were there for learn about the hotel back operations. It's a valuable opportunity to learn about the hotel. The view from the entrence. The enviroment inside the hotel and around the hotel rooms are so calming and quiet. The food, it was nicely presented, and very tasty.",positive
Great service. I can feel the people smiling when they do service to a guest. F&B Executive Mr Janatha. Learned a lot from him about the hotel. Food was delicious at the bufe. Learned to grill Kebab. Bufe service was great.,positive
Arrived at the Heritance Ahungalla at 2.00am in the morning after a 10.5 hour flight from Gatwick and a 2 hour coach transfer from airport. Absolutely tired out. We had booked 2 double rooms and 2 single rooms through Thomson's I had had problems regarding the wrong names in the wrong rooms and couldn't get it sorted through their call centre. When we went to check in they had only three rooms with a little bit of stern talk they sorted it. I believe the problem lies with Thomson's Their airport Rep was with us but did absolutely nothing to help. After that the Holiday was superb. The Hotel has the most friendly of staff Especially Himasha. The Buffet food is excellent with a vast variety of cuisines from English through Italian to Chinese and Asian. One tip! every one advises not to swim in the sea. as there are strong under currents safe enough to paddle but even then you can feel the under current drawing you out. However the 2 Hotel pools are beautiful and so swimming is no problem. I should give this hotel a rating of 5 but the problem at check in forces me to drop a star sorry.,negative
"Its a good hotel, slightly old, rooms are good, but bathrooms could be better. They follow and earthy feel so there r no tiles in the bathrooms and are very small. Its good to get a ground floor room which is closer to the beavh and pool. The food is amazing. Theybhave great variety of sea food and the flavoursvare great",positive
We visited this place for our annual business meeting. Ideal place for a get away and it is 2 hours drive from colombo. There is a vast Swiming pool where you can play water games. Excellent and delicious food.,positive
"The service throughout was first class for the whole 3 weeks of our holiday. The staff are honest, attentive and considerate. The room was very clean, comfortable with private balcony. 2 pools with sunbeds and sandy beach right in front of the hotel. The food was delicious and different every night with a buffet of Sri Lankan curries and western dishes and an excellent pudding buffet! Special mention to the following staff: Gayathri for excellent restaurant management skills, Saman for perfect housekeeping, Waiters, Jayal, Nihal and Petal, the Hopper Chefs, Himasha in the lobby, perfect hostess, and the most honest laundry staff ever! Thank you all at the Heritance for a wonderful holiday one which we intend to repeat soon!",positive
"Firstly, the hotel is GORGEOUS! Gorgeous pool, gorgeous beach. Local food at the buffet breakfast was simply out of this world. Staff were exceptionally friendly, helpful, kind and nice. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here thanks to the staff, the amazing food, the location and the wonderful hotel. Highly recommended. Can't wait to come back. Thank you",positive
"We had the most wonderful stay at this beautiful hotel which I cannot recommend enough. Our room was fabulous- clean and spacious with all of the amenities one may require for a holiday away. The hotel itself is beautiful, the pool is outstanding and the views out to sea are breath taking. The food provided was varied throughout our stay and the kitchen staff even asked daily if there was anything additional we would like as they would do their best to prepare it. We went on several trips which were amazing. Firstly we attended the nearby water safari, we arranged this through the TukTuk providers on the beach and were not disappointed by the experience. Not only do you see varying types of landscapes and animals but you also get to see Temples and local crafts such as Cinnamon production. We also visited the Elephants at the National park safari. This trip was absolutely outstanding however; please bear in mind that it takes roughly 4 hours to get to the park. Sri Lanka is a beautiful place and this was truly a remarkable hotel. We would definitely return.",positive
"Walked to this hotel from the Riu down the road and found an amazing colonial style building with astonishing grounds, where we came across a rather large Monitor Lizard, and beautiful beach front. We enjoyed an ice cold bottle of Lion Beer while sitting in the shade by the large swimming pool surrounded by fig trees. A fantastic way to spend an hour away from our hotel. Would look into staying here but might be put off by the price because the two beers cost us 1,300 Rs, which seemed a bit steep given the cost of living in Sri Lanka.",positive
"Dear Team Heritance, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you and your staff for the wonderful evening we enjoyed our Kaspersky Southern Regional Meet 2017. Your staff were real credit to you - very attentive, polite and everything ran very smoothly. The function hall was a perfect size for the number of guests and the tables were beautifully set out on the beach. Your kitchen staff served the meal very efficiently, and it was absolutely delicious. I am getting very positive feedback about the whole evening and I wish you all the very best for the future.",positive
"My Mum and I stayed in a sea view twin room with balcony. Lovely sized room with wonderful views, as anticipated. The hotel was at full capacity but you would never had known. Beautiful gardens and grounds were well cared for and spacious offering opportunity to relax in one of two pool areas without a busy atmosphere. Staff couldn't do enough for you and the food and services were great. Only downside that I could say was that the cocktail menu for all inclusive was not very extensive and mini bar in room was an additional cost, even tough we only had soft drinks. This was a little unexpected.",positive
"This is a great hotel in many ways. It is a Bawa design so the actual structure and lay out of the resort is outstanding. The rooms are well appointed with great showers. But for the price and the history of the place I thought the resort could have been better. 1) The resort falls down in comparison to other world class hotels in the details. For example, every room is given a fruit basket designed to resemble a traditional Sri Lankan out rigger. This is a great touch but the problem is that the boat basket was quite broken and falling apart. It should have been replaced long ago. There are examples of this where a good idea is not quite executed correctly. Another example was the intrusion of more conventional resorts into the appearance of this heritage building: in the bar area upstairs there was a Red Bull fridge displayed quite prominently. Does anyone truly think Bawa would have approved of such a thing? Of course not. It disrupts the entire point of a place built by Bawa and damages the aesthetic. The managers should be aware of this. 2) The food was okay but was a mass produced buffet designed to accommodate a large number of people. This led to the food becoming pretty routine after a few days. We also found that it was difficult to get the attention of staff and I found they were not very attentive. Sometimes we had to ask twice for something simple like water. My feeling was that they were very understaffed. 3) A big issue for me was the mattresses. I have some muscular skeletal problems so sleeping on a hard bed is not good for me. But the beds at Ahungalla were very hard. In general I cannot understand why they would not get medium softness beds to accomodate everyone's needs. These may seem like small details, but for the price, for the fact it is a 5 star hotel, and because of its history and heritage, I think the place could do better. Having said that, it is certainly a considerable step up from the majority of large resorts on the SL coast.",neutral
This hotel has clearly seen better days. It seems a bit dated now. I believe that this was one of Geoffrey Bawa's earliest hotels. It is not without charm though. Rooms were quite spacious and the bathrooms were pretty functional. Buffet breakfast and dinner did not disappoint. This can be an useful base to visit other areas close by.,positive
"My wife and I had a two week holiday here in December. Weather was good and we did trips to Yala National Park (4 hours by car) and Kandy (4 hours by car). I list below the positives and the negatives of our holiday. Positives : Good food in restaurant buffet with a different daily menu. Friendly and generally helpful staff throughout the hotel. Excellent sea view from our first floor bedroom balcony. Excellent sea front location offering lovely beach walks. Two very large and spacious swimming pools kept clean. Room very clean and some wonderful animal shaped towels kept us amused. International plug sockets, always a help. Good size balcony. Much needed cold drinks upon arrival. Clean sheets and towels daily. Large 50"" TV in bedroom. (A negative for us as we don't watch TV but probably a positive for others). Plenty of colourful bird life in the hotel grounds. And so to the negatives. No Jacuzzi for our entire stay. When we enquired we were told they were waiting for a part but by the time we left the Jacuzzi was looking very grubby with gathered dropped leaves and rainwater. Alcoholic drinks were expensive particularly a small glass of wine with dinner. Costly alcoholic drinks turned up very quickly at dinner but not the free water. On several occasions I had to ask three times for water. Lack of local railway train information at reception. No postcards sold at the hotel. We had air conditioning problems in our room which took a while to resolve. The plug in the wash basin didn't operate properly. No curtain in the bathroom for the first three days of our stay. Wobbly fan on the ceiling (maybe it was meant to be like that !). Wobbly bedside table definitely shouldn't be like that. Nowhere to walk to / have a coffee/beer/snack out the front of the hotel (busy road). That's even if you manage to get past the tour guides who hover by the hotel gates. Lack of lighting at night between the hotel front and the hotel gates. Insufficient staff in the restaurant when busy. This was particularly noticeable at weekends. Noisy building work being carried out on one wing of the hotel during the day. Some of these points might seem petty but added together it wasn't the holiday my wife and I had hoped for. Would definitely recommend Yala National Park. A visit to a Turtle hatchery. The Botanical gardens at Kandy. The fort at Galle .",neutral
"A Excellent resort overall, very good service, food. Beautiful swimming pool and beach, me and my wife stayed in December. Though you cant swim here coz of high wave and rip current. Best to swing is Hikkadua and Bentota beach. Tour desk very helpful to arrange day trips to Bentota, Hikkadua, Galle, Unawatana. If we get scope we will surely stay there again.",positive
"The hotel environment is very nice. Our room is very big & has direct access to the pools & the ocean. Food is ok. Yet, very disappointed that the bedsheet & pillow case are dirty .... and somewhat disgusting.",neutral
"A lovely setting for the hotel with the view across the foyer especially at sunset being spectacular. The hotel itself is a bit tired, and the front counter reception staff need a good talking to as they are too laid back and careless. On the other hand the staff in the dining room, bars and housekeeping are superb. In typical Sri Lankan style they cannot do enough for you with their service, attention to detail and genuine friendliness. And the food? Is absolutely divine. We had Sri Lankan food morning noon and night, and could not get enough of it. But for those who want it - there are plenty of opportunities for Western food as well.",positive
"We stayed for 7 days on an all inclusive basis. After a 9 hour flight and 2.5 hour transfer we arrived travel weary and thirsty in a group of 8 couples. The reception team didn't seem to be prepared for our arrival even though we were later than expected and it took 45 minutes before we got our room keys and 20 minutes before we were given a welcome drink. Our room was beautiful, a good size with a view over the gardens and a sea glimpse. The all inclusive meals were served in a large dining room on a buffet basis. The food was beautifully presented fresh with lots of fruit salads and vegetables and typically Sri Lanka very tasty. The staff were delightfully attentive especially after a couple of days and they got to know us, very friendly and always smiling from the guy who cleaned our room and the gardeners to the pool attendants and the bar and dining staff. A little more information on the All inclusive facilities would have been very useful. There was another restaurant on the site in addition to 3 lovely bars, but during the week that we were there we didn't see the restaurant being used, I believe that the menu offered 15 0/0 of the prices for all inclusive clients, I think that a nice gesture would have been to offer all inclusive customers one night during their stay to eat in the al a carte restaurant maybe at a fee of say £20 per head. This would have made a nice change from the buffet restaurant. Just a short distance from the hotels there is a turtle hatchery, and rescue sanctuary. On the way to which (by tuk tuk) we passed a tree full of enormous fruit bats, both these were well worth a visit. Walking along the beach to the right are a couple of beach restaurant bars good prices and an excellent place to watch the gorgeous sunsets. All in all a wonderful experience.",positive
Buying buffet tickets were as though lunch was freeLaid back service. food prices way too much compared to other hotels in this area. We had lunch buffeut and it was not at all good. It does not justify charges.,negative
"The location: Pleasant drive from Colombo.Beautiful , tranquil entrance. But the feeling did not last so long as it was a pain to check in. So many forms to fill and signatures, 4 separate ID documents for the 4 rooms. I would suggest the guest relation takes care of the forms instead of requesting the guest to fill it.Different ID docs per room, different signatures!!!! Absolutely ZERO CHILL!!! The rooms :Drab & dated in stark contrast to fond memories i had, visiting this establishment few years ago The food:Good variety , delicious & living up to Heritance standards Service: There were a few attentive staff.But had some bad experiences. My mother had a cramp (after swimming in that gorgeous pool) and requested some warm salt water brought in late night(10pm) .It took more than 30 mins for it to arrive .I wonder how long it would have taken to get a meal to a room. Dogded that bullet!! I feel like the new property next door must have poached best service personnel from here.",negative
"This is one of the best places i have stayed at to date. I was ushered straight to my Beautiful room after a nice welcome drink and an ice cold towel to clean my face. I can't say enough how helpful and friendly the staff have been, its a nice feeling when everybody is happy and smiling around you even the security guards had big warm smiles on there faces! Restaurant was excellent , great variety and very high standard buffet- delicious sri lankan curries with all the trimmings had me everyday! The staff in the restaurant have been great and i would personally like to thank them for making it such a lovely experience.",positive
"Stayed 2 nights. Nice Hotel and the food and bar area is great. Nice activities in the hotel with cultural shows etc. Service is great, and the staff is helpful. Check in takes a bit of time, but it is normal for SL.",positive
"We loved our stay here. We booked direct through Booking.com and arrived to a stunningly landscaped hotel. However our room was dark and the standard was below that we had experienced at other Heritance hotels in Sri Lanka. The dining room equally was dark and the morning buffet compromised quality for quantity. We asked to see the GM, explained using pictures from the rooms and talked about the catering. Specifically we mentioned the very undercooked bacon. The GM and his staff could then not have done more to turn things around. We were moved to outstanding corner rooms, were treated to an evening Russian Christmas celebration (lobster and fireworks) on the beach and came down to breakfast the next day to fresh orange juice, excellent service and a chef whose responsibility was to deliver crispy bacon. The GM and his senior team came over and checked on our satisfaction during the day. We understand that there will be an extensive renovation programme starting in April including a renewed dining room and improved rooms. Once done, and with this management team who listen and respond to feedback, this hotel will be an even more superb place to stay.",positive
"Very nice hotel, beautiful beach with less people, friendly men and women at the service (young girl Himasha is so nice), delicious food, sri Lanka is such a nice island, I will come back, thats for sure",positive
I've only checked in but so far my experience is terrible. Booking and check in process was thoroughly disorganized and apathetic. Location and hotel are beautiful though so I hope the trip proves from here.,negative
"Had a marvellous time here, after an intense 5 day sightseeing tour of Sri Lanka it was just what we needed. The rooms are fabulous, the staff are courteous (it's a Sri Lankan trait) and the range of services etc are excellent. Two big pools, rarely very crowded, and a lovely sandy beach a few yards beyond the pool.",positive
We had a family holiday here in October. We were really impressed with the attentive and personalised service. I had the impression this was something to do the with hotel culture itself as all staff responded with interest and care. There was a mishap with our booking which the reception manager handled so well which compensated for any inconvenience. I have been in such situations before which leaves you feeling irritated. however there was a distinct (positive) difference in the quality of customer service here which makes customers feel valued. the Food is super!! great location and beach front and Bawa's architecture does have it's charm!,positive
I love my room so much. It is so beautiful and comfortable. The swimming pools are also beautiful. The food in the buffet is delicious. The staff are so gentle and polite. I wish I could have more time there.,positive
"I was there on Christmas Eve, 2016 and the resort was well decorated, As you enter the building, you get the horizon view with swimming pool first, soft sand second and limitless sea, without any obstruction. For Christmas Eve, a live band was performing and they had huge variety of cakes and patisseries. Band was playing good and when people hit the floor to dance, it played some rock tracks. The resort also attempts to give you extra other than sun, sand and sea by having a foosball table, pool table and carrom. For swimming pool, they also give you volley ball and rugby to play with. They have good facility and numerous poolside benches to relax. Improvements: Over all, the resort provides you with all the luxuries, however, there is a room for improvements as well. First, the resort is very less decorated as compared to the era of resorts in trend. Second, the resort shall attempt to organise games and other activities to keep the tourists engaged. Third, though the resort always had huge menu, the taste can be improved.",positive
We had 5 nights at this hotel - our start wasn't great after travelling all day to arrive to issues with check in and delays to get to our rooms - not ideal with three small children. But the staff made up for the error by delivering a wine with apologies later. Staff were fantastic at breakfast and dinner - special mention to our amazing chef who took great care of my family catering for their food requirements. Buffet was excellent - lots of choice. Rooms very clean. Poolside staff amazing also especially entertaining the children with games of cricket and water polo. Not cheap by any means to stay here. Hotel is in need of capital funds injection - gym facilities and hotel aging - needs up keep to be 5 star quality. Lovely stay,positive
I used to visit this lovely place with my family many times. Every time we were taken cared and offered us the best hospitality in the southern region. I must say food is absolutely wonderful with so much to choose. In deed it is delicious. Rooms are spacious and top clean. Special thanks to Mr. Janaka for the lovely bed deco. Restaurant is at its best service. Altogether me and my family had a lovely time on Christmas Eve. Santa's arrival on a turtle gave a totally different and surprise experience Thank you all for the most amazing time in this Christmas.,positive
"My family and friends loved the beach, the swimming pool and the long walks; one of which took us to a rocky area with a fort like construction. The service was great and they had a good food spread. The head chef prepared specific dishes to suit our palates (and allergies). The spa was a tad pricey, but one should expect this! The water Zumba was a super hit. A definite must visit.",positive
"We were part of a 4 family group on a holiday to Sri Lanka. We spent 2 nights here. Amazing property, great view, nice pool. Overall a great experience. However, as a vegetarian, I found the food scene a bit disappointing. Apparently it is a sea food lovers paradise. Kid friendly place. They have pool tables, a library, carton board etc. Plan to do nothing but eat , swim, vegetate and chill. Take a stroll on the beautiful beach, play beach volleyball. Don't miss to take a walk to the nearby private property/resort. They have a small rock beach with amazing views.",neutral
So i stayed here in november 2016 what a great hotel staff very friendly and the room was beautifull. I would recomend this hotel for people wanting a quite and relaxing holiday. Be Warned you will need to get some pure cinimmon oil to fend off the mosquito's as the unusual sparys dont work. my only complaint is that due to this hotel only having 180 rooms there is not the best choice of food in the buffet resturant. But you can get al-carte food at the other 2 resturants in the hotel it cost me about £40 for me and the wife for a 3 course meal. I will definitey be returning to this hotel in a couple of years,positive
"As a couple, we stayed here for 4 nights and we absolutely loved it. Yes the rooms are a bit outdated but it has character and the staff are so lovely. Customer service is the most important thing to me and they exceeded in that. The hotel is right by the beach and has two large pools. There is also a game room with pool tables and other games. We don't have kids but the kids play centre could be improved. The food stations in the buffet are fantastic - great variety and delicious. I went to hotel riu next door and this hotel is much nicer and more relaxing. I've also stayed at Heritance Kandalama and had a similar great experience. Thank you to all the staff who made our experience wonderful. Would definitely recommend this and would stay here again.",positive
"Returned after 10 years and found the place to be just as amazing as I remembered. What I didn't expect was the care and kindness from the staff. I was sent a surprise birthday cake after dinner! But i was moved by the assistance provided to us when my 4yo daughter slipped and fell near the pool just before checking out. Family members left in the hotel, while we were at the hospital, were looked after well. The staff were kind enough to arrange a special meal for us as we were not back till hours after the buffet lunch was over.",negative
"Our family stayed two nights from 23.12.2016. Prompt check-in and fully escorted from reception to the guestrooms. Nice place to chill and relax by the pool and beach. Spacious room and comfortable bed; however, interior looks dated. It appears that some rooms are newly renovated while some are dated. As for housekeeping, again we observed inconsistencies as with other hotels we stayed in throughout our trip. Restaurant staff are courteous and register good memory of guests. Food was good. Spa masseuses from Bali were good. Kudos for the well-organized Christmas Eve party! It was a memorable time for my family...surprising entrance by Santa, and fireworks at midnight!",positive
"This hotel is about a 2-hour car ride from the airport. You will be warmly welcomed with a drink etc. but the check-in takes a little longer than desired. Best to confirm details with the hotel and ensure your room is ready. Also, as it’s a busy holiday period the rooms were overbooked to begin with. This hotel is rated as a 5* hotel. Sometimes, the service took awhile via housekeeping and a few calls to clarify were necessary. The amenities/ toiletries were less than average, so pack something of quality for yourself. The views are 6* and the 2 pools are just fantastic, also worthy of 6* stars, they were clean and they overlook the beach. Note: fairly deep pools for non-swimmers, a shallow end but not for toddlers, it gets deep quickly! The breakfast and dinners are of 5* quality. A special mention to Chef Manjula who gave the 5 children the extra special service. Staff are friendly and happy to help. Sometimes language miscommunication - misinterpretation occurs so double-check requests. The rooms were clean but to be frank this hotel is dated in parts and could use a capital injection to make the place sparkle. I’m traveling with cousins but usually travel solo. As a solo I would be reluctant to be here because patrons don’t tend to mingle as they do in smaller boutique hotels. However, if you’re seeking downtime (alone time) then it’s a great place. Would I recommend this hotel? Yes, for the pools, food and views but equally there are other hotels that would compare easily. I didn’t go to the spa but my family members said it was ‘good’ (hotel prices). Cocktails reasonably priced. Service/Tax charges are high in SL. The check-out was efficient. The hotel has three floors, some views from some rooms are brilliant, facing the beach or gardens. Good luck, I hope this review was helpful.",positive
"Just return from a week in Herritance Ahungala. The hotel is amazing with its infinity pool facing towards the ocean. Plenty of sunbeds, beautiful beach. Maybe the rooms needs to be renovated but that is no important, the most important are the people, with their heart on hands just to make your stay perfect. They are not a staff they are a heritance family and try to do everything that you become also a part of their family. Food prepared by Chef Manjula is just delishes. Beginning from European cuisine ending on real taste of Sri Lanka. Grilled lobster, crab curry, dhal, egg hooper are to die for. The food was the best I have been eaten in the all-inclusive hotel. Must say that in many good restaurant you will not eat better. Chef Manjula, who I have had chance to meet personally gave me is even his secret recipe for dhal. I have seen some negative comments about the rooms, food, cleaning- so if you look for a just the hotel (good drinks, animation, standard hotel food) do not go there but if you want to feel the soul of Sri Lanka is the place for you.",negative
"The staff were very courteous. Especially the staff at the restaurant including the managers, were very helpfill. The pool was well maintained. The rooms were very comfortable. The food and ambience excellent. Overall it is an excellent place to stay.",positive
"This is my third time in Heritance, and every time I get there I am stressed out but by the time I leave I am happy and relaxed. The hotel is rustic and very chilled out. Highly recommended for a break.",positive
"First of the good: The people and the rooms are great. Very helpful and kind staff. Rooms have a great view. The bad: Co-ordination of our trip was very poor. We got in very late and realized that they only booked us in 1 room when our reservation said 2 rooms. They ended up finding a room for my wife and I, but it had 2 twin beds rather than a king/queen. Same goes for my parents room. Food: Food was average at best. At a 5 (or 4 star) property, you expect the food to be excellent as you end up spending a lot of time just hanging out at the property rather than running around from place to place. Us being vegetarians was especially hard. We had the same 3-4 dishes to pick from. Most of them even seemed to be served from the meal before. The chef told us that we should have informed them of our dietary restrictions. However, from a 5 star resort, you expect them to follow up with you prior to your visit or during reservation, asking you of these things. Nothing of the sort happened. Of course, if they had followed up prior, the mix up with the room would not have happened either. In addition, if they followed up, they would've known that my father is disabled and would have found a room closer to the elevator.... I can't really recommend this property for the price we paid.",neutral
Fabulous pristine beach. Spacious hotel which blends in to the surroundings. Simple relaxed and calm. Rooms are comfortable. Food with all inclusive buffets caters to all types. Courteous and helpful staff.,positive
"We visited Heritance Ahungalla on 14 December and stayed one night. (This was our second time at the hotel. First visted about 5 years ago). Travelled with our two young children and parents. We booked two rooms via hotel website as it offered a 30% discount. Upon arrival, we were greeted by friendly staff members who offered scented towels and a nice fresh fruit juices as welcome drinks. The check-in process took about 30 minutes as the staff were unable to locate our booking and had to call the head office in Colombo to verify the booking. We were told that online bookings sometimes dont show up in their system. I was not impressed by this as 30 minutes to check in is a long time and we were waiting at the lobby with two young kids. We requested for a free upgrade to compensate for the long wait and we were given an upgrade to rooms in the new wing of the hotel on first floor (Rooms 245 and 247). They were beautiful rooms , very tastefully deconrated and I loved the wooden furniture. They added an extra touch of elegance to the room. We had views of hotel's second swimming pool. It was great.The bathroom had a rain shower and looked new and very clean. The bed was perfect. The rooms did look very new and we were very pleased to get a free upgrade. Thank you to the front desk staff for your generosity ! One negative thing I noticed was that the front lobby area looked a bit old and needs a facelift. I have been to many hotels and resorts in Sri Lanka and have noticed that hotels don't do regular maintenance of their facilities. They seem to wait till facilities look really bad to undetake refurbishment. I felt the same about this hotel. Though our rooms were very nice, I wonder how the older rooms are and if they are in good condition. I must mention that the staff often went out of their way to help us and meet out needs. They even asked if we needed any food that was not in the buffet to be prepared. My 6 year old daughter was disappointed that the dinner and lunch buffets didnt have ice cream for desert but the staff quickly brought her an ice cream cone on both occasions. The management should be extremely proud that they have such good staff and are so willing to assist guets. The dinner buffet was great, it was an Asian theme that night and had chinese, thai and vietnamese food including lots of sea food. We thoroughly enjoyed the food. The breakfast and lunch were good as well. Overall we were very very pleased with the service and regretted that we only stayed one night. We will definitely be back again.",positive
"I visited Heritance ahungalla in the last couple of days and it's been a very joyous time for me and the whole family. As always the staff is extremely helpful and friendly and is quick to render their services to meet any customers specification. Cleanliness and room quality astounds anyone who would walk in to their rooms, it's honesty top class. Food was amazing (which is one of the main reasons I visit Heritance atleast once a year without fail for the last 5 or more years). The decorations and the special events arranged for christmas made the hotel look even more festive than usual. A special thanks to Mr. Thushara ( Restaurant and Bar Manager Of Heritance Ahungalla ) for making our stay even merrier than normal. I will be expecting to definitely make my next reservation in probably next August. Thank you to all guys at Heritance Ahungalla, You really do deserve a pat on your backs and a huge thumbs up for everything.",positive
"My favorite hotel in down south Sri Lanka...Beautiful place...Nice friendly staff..Good widely spread buffet meals.. Clean and tidy rooms and nice view of Indian Ocean from hotel lobby...Always love to go there. ..Special thank goes to Mr. Thushara , Managers of FB Department. ..",positive
I was extremely satisfied with the service provided and the room. Also the food was as great as always. Their ice cream sandwich is highly recommended! Special shout out to Mr.Thushara ( restaurant and bar manager) for making our stay comfortable and enjoyable :),positive
I would say that the meals were excellent and well suited for the Sri Lankan pallet. The staff was very helpful and friendly. They could improve on the rooms as I found the interior a bit outdated compared to other hotels. I would say overall it was worth the money and would go there again.,positive
"We have visited heritance last week to stay for 2 days. I must say from the first moment till we check out their service was awesome. Friendly staff with professional service. Rooms were as described, comfortable beds with AC and bath rooms were spacious. Now comes to the best part.. the food! Breakfast was fabulous lots of varieties..If you are Sri lankans visiting from anyother county don't forget to go outside of the main restaurant where all the tasty ""Appa"" and Sri Lankan food is available.. also they had ""seeni Banis"" and tasty ""maalu Banis"" Lunch and Dinner were also great.. too much various food.. suitable for any person around the world.. Ah the last thing the swimming pool.. they have one of the best swimming pools in the country.. facing towards the Sea huge swimming pool which is children friendly. Why don't you give a try? My kids and grandma enjoyed the stay. Hope you will do the same. Genuine review!",positive
This hotel is hit or miss. We stayed in a beautiful room but had a view of trash and falling apart tennis courts. There were ants in our room. There are some nice areas (main pool) and some very run down areas (spa area). The beach is nice and long but water is rough with currents and rip tides. The breakfast buffet and lunch buffet were plentiful so it was easy to find food for each preference. The service was good but slow. It took us 20 minutes to check out through some outdated cashier methods (spa had to bring a paper copy of their charges while we waited).,negative
"This was our third stay at this hotel . The food was very high quality . Most of all the front office , restaurant and the house keeping staff were very friendly and helpful . The hotel was very modern and attractive . We enjoyed our stay a lot . We hope to visit again !!!",positive
"We hosted an International Conference on Assisted Reproductive Technologies for a group of 90 doctors from around the world. We have been hosting such meetings annually in destinations like Nepal, Goa, Khajuraho, Seychelles, Singapore & more. This was one of our best experiences with a Hotel that taught us what Sri Lankan hospitality is all about. The front office staff, the back-end staff, the F & B staff and the event management team were all excellent and helpful and set new bench-marks fro us for future meetings. The property is visually stunning and the open lobby takes your breath away with the majestic ocean view on entering the Hotel. Attention to small details like the design of the trolley that brings welcome drinks to a guest checking in and the smiling faces of the front desk staff go a long way in first impressions. Although the property is 35 years old, it is very well maintained with huge trees planted in the stair-wells. The architecture and design and the room interiors all blend for an exotic asian experience. The meals are wonderful, the four bars in the hotel are superlative and the three swimming pools take your breath away. The conference was running two halls simultaneously and the meeting went off without a glitch. Three nights we had music concerts in the main hall and cocktails being served. This was a global gathering and the unanimous opinion was ""this was one of the best experiences we have had!"" Since I was the President of the meeting, I did not have time to relax and want to go back for a short break only to take in the same sights and smells again. This was like Heaven.",positive
"Glad to see you are renovating the rooms which are far better than the drab rooms with rusty fridges on the other side but what happened with the food which was very average maybe even poor , heritance was known for its food, we only had one night of decent food and that was for a tour group, also I see nothing has changed with the beach boys/men hovering at the hotel and a constant annoyance,",neutral
"We had a two days stay in heritance ahungallla, and i would certainly recommend this hotel for anybody who are looking for a calm quite and luxurious experience with huge private pool and specially i would state that they have an excellent food spread for both locals and foreigners!. Affordable! Clean ! Calm & Quite ! The staffs are very friendly and the hotel is very homely feeling. *******Good Luck*******",positive

Me and my wife stayed at Heritance Ahungalla. It was a lovely hotel with classy architecture. The room was spacious and looked clean. We got a room with sea view. Food was good but no varieties at all. But we enjoyed our one night stay in this hotel.,positive
"This hotel offers a very good beach side location. The beach is unspoilt compared to there places that I stayed at in Sri Lanka. The facilities, service and food are all excellent. If I return to Sri Lanka, then this hotel will be where I stay.",positive
We came here for our honeymoon. Very good rooms. We were given a cake upon arrival as well! Furthermore we were also upgraded to a suite! Super food as there was variety as well. wonderful service and friendly staff. Pool was also good (there were two pools and one was not used much and a private place. Perfect for us). I have come here plenty of times and will visit again!,positive
The hotel is too large and it is a 40 year old So it is kind of an old hotel The room service is late We checked in and the shampoo and body gel bottles were empty Regardless of all this they have a nice looking beach The lobby is wide and open to the ocean and unfortunately it is as hot as the ocean and the outside street I dont know it is a good hotel if they did renew it,negative
"We travelled with family on an outing, that had been planned a couple of months in advance. One of the members of our party is in a wheelchair and from the time of booking, this was mentioned as a special request. However, it was extremely difficult in getting confirmation from the hotel (both head office and hotel were contacted) if they were able to accommodate this guest. Several calls and emails went ignored and we resorted to calling a friend. This was extremely annoying as full paying customers you would like to think that the hotel would want to provide you with this basic service. A complaint made to the FB page provided some call back, but as always the trail went cold. We were unsure as to if this guest was able to make it, so in sheer desperation we had someone physically visit the hotel the week prior to our holiday and ask if they could be shown a few of the room categories, we were happy to upgrade if necessary. However, the person was not shown all categories and so the guest decided to only come for the day. Needless to say, we went there already disappointed with what the hotel had to offer. Once we checked in, we realised that one of our rooms was able to accommodate the guest in the wheelchair, and then proceeded to go to great lengths to ensure this guest joined us for the night. When we questioned the front desk as to why this room had not been shown to us, we were not given a valid response and we let it be, as we felt like we had already exerted way too much effort in what was meant to be a relaxing holiday! Needless to say, I felt like reservations, front desk and the head office staff were negligent and incompetent in this regard. Thereafter our trip went along smoothly, the staff were friendly and courteous and cooperated with requests such as bringing out a birthday cake. The rooms were clean and the common areas pleasant. It is a decent family hotel. The food was average at best, with no real highlights. Nice enough for a holiday with kids, but not good enough to compensate for all the hassle with the levels of initial service rendered.",negative
"We are a European Asian couple who came to Sri Lanka for our Winter vacations. We admire Geoffrey Bawa as a legendary architect and decided to come to one of the hotels designed by him to live his work for real. So We booked two nights in Heritance Ahungalla. Today is the second night of our stay and we just left the beautiful beach after the music reached the point of a super loud sound test. When we checked in we were made to sit and wait in front of a really loud bad music group. We complained a few times about the loud music right in our ear but they smiled and continued, forcing us to move away with our bags. Otherwise the treatment we got in checkin process was cool. But all the good mood was gone thanks to the awful music. Bawa designed his buildings in a way that the outside is coming to the inside and there are lots of open spaces. So really bad music in full volume means that you will hear it all over the hotel even in your own corridor. We complained more than 10 times and witnessed that other tourists were laughing at the music and walked away as far from the lobby as they could. The hotel management put really ugly ridiculous christmas decoration in the lobby and inside the beautiful infinity pool making, a big mockery of Bawa who designed the lobby so that you see the sea behind the infinity pool. The food was okay, nothing special other than a terrible vegetable chop suey and vegetable fried rice we got for yesterdays lunch. They have great freshly baked bread and spreads which we loved. And nice veggie burgers. Our room was interesting, as it seems to be originally as designed by Bawa years ago. The mini bar was dirty inside and the refrigerator quite rusty. The wifi worked well for my computer every where in the hotel, but my wife had not as much as luck as i did. The staff were trying to give us a friendly face and some times we met nice people. A front desk guy called Khan was really funny and cool to talk to when he helped us secure the late checkout which we were promised via booking.com. The dining area got really wet under my own feet with lots of rain water this morning when it was heavily raining. Our corridor and the bar/ reception area was flooded because the roofs and windows were leaking. They have amazing pools designed by Bawa and we used every opportunity jump in to them. The hotel is an architectural masterpiece and in a very cool location. However, the company that runs it seems to be treating this paradise for architectural lovers as just a another cheaply run 5 star hotel to use as space for mega groups they bus in to maximise profit. The loud music and badly maintained building may kill it for most. For us, we will not come again unless some miracle happens tomorrow. We are extremely disappointed of the fate of Bawa's hotel.",negative
This is our third visit to heritance Ahungala we were welcomed warmly as always by the front office staff we were given a nice rooms clean and has a good view food is excellent and staff gives a superb service We will come back again next month special thanks to Khan and Thilini From the front Desk,positive
"There was some minor renovations of the neighbouring rooms, but since we were mostly at the pool or out during the day, it didn't really bother us. Helpful attentive staff and a great breakfast. Other meals were good too. Loved the in house guests only pool as compared to the main pool as it had more shade. But main pool had a lovely view of the ocean. This hotel has its charm in its design and fittings. Not like the neighbouring Riu which I'm sure is great but is more modern and ... well white. The beach here is clean and really nice. Nothing much near the hotel, except the turtle hatcheries. May not appeal to many but do understand that at least the eggs are being hatched and released rather than consumed. So don't begrudge the entrance fees.",neutral
last night we were at Heritance . That was a lovely hotel. At the entrance they gave us a admirable welcome . After that we entered to the dinning area . The food was delicious . They had variety of food . Yesterday [ Friday ] was Sri Lankan night . We enjoyed our meals very well . We could taste different traditional Sri Lankan sweet meats . We enjoyed the king coconut drink with lemon grass the most . Finally we saw a troop of kandyan dancers . The restaurant manager Mr. Praveen and G.M Mr . Senarathne and the entire restaurant team were very friendly and helpful . Yesterday was an unforgettable day for our lives!!!,positive
"Came in here over the weekend, drove from Colombo and got in late but the reception was ready for us and got us checked in real quick. They had a spacious room for three but they missed the basics like refilling the amenities like toothbrushes etc. and had to be ordered. And the shower gel, conditioner and Shampoo had no labels so we had trial and test to see what was what. So frustrating!! Nevertheless they made up with the amazing location absolutely amazing service and great spread for both breakfast and lunch as that's what we had. Ordered room service for dinner which was apt but they overkilled on the French fries!! I'd recommend you guys to go for the ambiance and location and hopefully if they correct these small issues you have a killer deal!! Cheers!",negative
Me and my wife spent our Holiday at Heritance Ahungalla.. When we arrived at the hotel the staff welcomed us with a traditional sweet. The check in process was so easy we were asked to relax in the lounge while the staff organised everything. The room provided was a 100% match to the description with all the Amenities.. The staff were quite polite and friendly throughout our stay.. The food at the hotel was amazing.. They had a wide variety of Sri Lankan and Western food which we both enjoyed a lot. We are so glad that we selected this hotel .. 👍🏾👍🏾😘,positive
"I used to be a frequent guest since early 2009. This hotel used to be one of the best in every possible way. I should say that the location is great, with absolutely stunning views of the southern beaches of Sri Lanka. The architecture, flora and fauna gives a very relaxing feeling away from the commercial/business feeling. The staff is still very helpful, most would bed over back to entertain the guests. During the last visit with my wife they even upgraded me to their best suite, the Sachin Tendulkar Suite with no buzz or hazel at all. I must say, the rooms are of good size. But unfortunately that is where it ends! The buffets are not up to the standards ( I am being very polite and generous towards the hotel here). Variety is lacking, taste is lacking, freshness is lacking. The edible items run over in 1 hour, so if you go there it late - you are left to trial the buns and sandwiches like parchment, and some left over stuff. As with many other hotels in SL they seem to cater a specific corporate client base, as a result the food spoils it for the relaxing holiday traveller. This is not just one time experience, but my observations over time. Restaurants and ala carte has little to offer. The ""best suite"" feels like collapsing on one end, not cleaned for days on another note, and worse of all even the renovation seems to be left at half way. Little activities happening at night, and the management does not seem to be interested in addressing it for years. Last few visits all I felt is that the staff at junior positions, room services, and reception are trying to blow some warmth and energy into it, but the higher levels seem to be not bothered about what they offer to the clients. While I do believe, looking at the number of corporate customers in the restaurant (mainly East Asian and Indian - whom I have randomly come to contact with, have informed me that they are sent to this place via corporate arrangements, not by choice) that the hotel is likely making good returns and is not financially pressured to invest in restructuring and renovation; it makes me sad that this is like an aincient giant which is approaching its last legs. Would I recommend it to anyone? Probably not if you are on your vacation. Given there are quite nice new boutique hotels in the area, for a fraction higher price point. Would I go there again? Probably not, unless the hotel addresses these issues effectively, because it's a waste of time and money the way it is.",negative
"This place has deteriorated unbelievably. I have visited the hotel on multiple occasions. In the early 2012s the Hotel was decent with friendly staff. Now its all gone down sour. I revisited again in 2016 but was shocked to find out that the standards have turned so bad. Firstly, I was welcomed by the usual friendly smiles and what not but the staff at the pool were extremely rude, and racist... I took some family visiting from the middle east for lunch and soon found that the hotel service made them very upset. They tried to use the pool, however soon knocked back and told that 3 quarter shorts weren't suitable for pool. These idiots have no idea. As a traveller in many western countries, I have never seen such fools running a hotel.. They don't know what guest services means... then the racism part kicks in where the staff are plain rude and are like robots and smiles at white skin guests, but frowns upon anyone with a tinge more of colour... Absolutely ridiculous and I discourage anyone from travelling and staying at this hotel....",negative
"This hotel was designed on a very grand scale, and is having a hard job keeping up to date. Nevertheless, we had a good stay. Our room was fine, with seaview. Fittings were perhaps not the newest/most modern, but good nonetheless. Tea/coffee facilities and bottled water provided each day. Breakfast buffet is varied (note: cooked breakfast is outside through a set of doors - not immediately obvious!) and good. We ate at the hotel 'Mustard' restaurant twice - choices of international cuisine and local. Poolside bar offers cocktails and ice-cream sundaes (Spice Inheritance sundae was great, though not as large as the photo suggests!). Bike hire is possible - though you're likely to get a local standard one with no gears. This is ok for going around the area. The bellboy will, when prompted, provide a map of a route (says 2 hours, but is less time) past cinnamon plantations etc. (The hotel reception seemed unaware of this route information, and anyway it needs updating and could be better signposted!). Pool table costs 300 Rs an hour; snooker table 600 Rs. Would have thought these could be provided free of charge for guests. Beach is great. Loungers and towels available. Chipmunks fun to watch (and once an iguana!). TukTuks available outside the hotel - charge 1000 to go to Bentota and back - the TukTuk drivers know some excellent places to find souvenirs/tea/Ayurveda stuff that you wouldn't find on your own. Hotel taxi would offer to take you to same place for 3000 Rs.",positive
"We spent quite a few hours checking and selecting the place to stay during our vacation on Sri Lanka and never regreted about staying at this place! 1) Location - very good and convenient, you can go whenever you want from this part of coast, whether it is about tours, cafes or shopping - and it won't take too much time. 2) Hotel - very neat, modern and clean - during our stay we saw a lot of workers who were looking on plants, cleaning, fixing issues and making everyhting to get the guests a pleasant stay. What can I say more when we get the room cleaning service 2 times per day! That is just amazing. You use the towel after the pool or the beach before the dinner and when you come back after it - the towels are new and your bed is made! 3) Staff - super friendly and welcoming, always smiling and willing to help. Really feeling like a special treatment. Special thanks to make me feel special at my Birthday. 4) Food - just incredible. Can't say more, it is impossible :) 5) Beach - however the beach is not related to the hotel but it was always clean. And the lifeguards were taking care of irresponsible swimmers 6) Atmoshpere - relaxing. Whatever it was - lying on the pool or chilling at the bar - you did not feel anything uncomfortable or annoying. There was just one small thing I did not get. When we checked in I asked on reception if possible to give us a room with a great ocean view as it was my birthday and we wanted to chill a little bit and celebrate with my husband on the terrace. I was told that I am given with the best room they have (which is obviously not true as i was not requesting a luxe, just wanted the same type i had but with better view options). The guy stressed out several times that he is giving us the best room and he is doing his best. Of course he got some tips for that. It ended up with completely the same room as our friends had but on the next floor - with a really GREAT view - a huge tree in front of us. Obviously no ocean view, just sound :) After that this reception guy just ignored us through the whole term of our staying. All I got was the feeling that I've been used somehow. Well, no offence, just don't get his approach to the service. Apart from this small detail the rest staff and the hotel in general is the must visit for everyone who ever wants to visit Sri Lanka. P.S. if you need a really awesome local guide who is not expensive but professional and very-very friendly - ask around about Wimal. He is the extra-friendly and always willing to help you and to show the best places! Highly recommend.",positive
"Me and my family stayed on FB basis for one day at heritance, ahungalle in october. the best thing was the food there. However, except for the welcoming staff at entrances staff was un or minimally attentive most of the time, of course they attend to us if we go and poke them repeatedly. we have booked a triple room and checked in around 4pm but there were twin beds in the room and after repeatedly reminding them they finally added an extra foldable bed. the person who brought the bed looked like a senior for that area, when we complained he just muttered something like 'twin bed room is the only room type available at heritance when you book a triple room and we always add an extra bed , only difference is you will get meals for 3 people' and walked away rapidly, on us... there were no room amenities in the room- no iron or ironing board, no water for three people, no slippers ,toothbrushes, cups etc at all. when we needed something we had to call and wait and call again . ultimately one person appeared with a trolley and instead of replacing missing items asked us to take whatever missing in the room. and the dark color pillow covers were so dirty we just kept them away. no one has bothered to change them for ages . safe was not functioning and when we typed numbers it missed some and got locked,then the person who attended late to fix it couldnt identify that its battery was low. finally it was fixed and by about 8.30 we managed to go for dinner. it may be due to overcrowded hotel but they already had 2 hours extra to check the room beforehand since we were late for check in. meals were good, staff was also more attentive. no one offered a baby high seater for our 3 year old and we had to go after them at all the 3 meals for a chair... restaurant is overcrowded and no one is there to offer water or clean tableware. they are only interested in taking plates away, at least that's a good thing. chefs and the restaurant manager were very supportive and offered some food for our baby , they were kind enough to deliver the dishes to our room as well. There is no sea view from the room and there was some construction work going on right next to our room which we didnt mind much.. next morning we asked them to take the plates away but no one showed up. by 1pm we were ready to check out and until that time no cleaning was done and room smelled of stale food. overall we didnt mind it as it was a one night thing ,tolerable on a full stomach and surely this place happens to be a typical siri lankan hotel, no matter how many stars they got,..",negative
"Submitted for a friend on holiday with no internet access: If you are considering going to Sri Lanka with Thompson don't bother and have had to post on here as your in resort reps are ignoring everything!! Ahungalla Heritance Sri Lanka, in resort rep name is Ruwan and his team leader won't even speak to us, they won't move us and are not interested. The toilet is leaking into the room !!! There is massive construction work that we were not told about going on with jack hammers on the go, on top of this there was no privacy in the bathroom due to the room/window set up and when it was complained about a member of the hotel staff used masking tape and cardboard to cover it!!!! We Have offered to pay the difference to move next door And the hotel and the resort reps don't care, and to top it off despite paying for all inclusive .... they won't give out soft drinks. Shocking customer service, shocking in resort service do not use this company or resort they do not care!!!",negative
"My partner and I have arrived from the UK this afternoon and we knew instantly, that we had made a big mistake choosing this property as our base in Sri Lanka. The lobby has as much ambience as my mothers funeral in September!!!!!! It is dark, unwelcoming, cold,uncomfortable furnishings and lacks any kind of warmth and inviting environment. We had paid for an upgrade on our room prior to leaving the UK with a double bed deluxe sea view. We got neither. Room was damp with a smell of urine from the bathroom. Interior was again dark with numerous scratches on furniture. No ocean view and two twin beds put together and the safe was not secure to anything!!!!! Tiles missing from the bathroom and no kettle,ironing board and iron!! The list is endless. Complained to the management and the front of house manager did state some of the rooms had not been upgraded in thirty five years. We were moved to another room which was supposed to be an upgrade. Alas not. Toilet that leaks, as well as the air conditioning: no secure safety box and the smell of fresh paint. Have eaten n the restaurant this evening. Best described as bland, average and uninspiring. We have already been in touch with our tour operator to move us or we will be returning early home. The only positive are the very friendly staff. If any of the hotel management read this we are in room 355. If you want luxury, with the added little touches do not come here, save your money and go elsewhere.",negative
WARNING!!!! The entire place is revolting. Dirty!! I have stayed in backpackers cleaner than this dump. Mould all throughout the shower & air vents. The dinner buffet was inedible and costs $38 pp. So throughly disappointed. The only thing this place has going for them are friendly staff. Such a disappointment after such amazing accomodation in SriLanka Total rip off 100% would NEVER recommend.,negative
"On arrival we both thought this was a 4* hotel but within 24 hours we realised why it was rated 5* - every staff member contributed to our * rating upgrade. We were made to feel like we were the only guests there,nothing was too much trouble. Newly refurbished rooms were beautifull as was the infinity pool which greets you on arrival.The food was top class - lobster Thermidor for lunch on a Tuesday!! This all inclusive hotel really is 5* ALL staff were very professional and our thanks to Sisira Senaratne for running such a wonderful hotel, wouldn't hesitate to recommend it,can't wait to go back.",positive
"The hotel environment was amazing. Number of places to relax, walk and chat. The beautiful beach and the pools provided an unforgettable experience. Our dinner was superb; number of choices / delicious. Staff was friendly and flexible.",positive
"Comparing this hotel to other Heritance properties it falls well below. The facilities are good and the hotel is ok. In every area of the hotel, staff seemed a little directionless. When we arrived the checkin process was disorganised. Everyone was quite pleasant but just not efficient. At the pool bar we had 3 waiters just walk straight past us. The person who seemed to be the head waiter was standing there checking his mobile phone. Eventually we had to ask to be served. On the pool deck no one was offering service. We had to go hunt it down. Some people were staying here on an ""all inclusive"" package which may explain the poor service. The buffet was ""unloved"". I'd often open a closh to find it empty underneath - eg no sausages or bacon at 8.30am during breakfast. The staff at this hotel had poor English skills and it was often difficult to be understood. I appreciate that English is a second language but it's essential in a five star hotel. This hotel needs a sharp eyed management team to set high standards and coach staff effectively. On a positive note - Heritance Hotels have the best toilet paper of any hotel group in the world!!",neutral
Several times I was in this Hotel.Very specialy I have to mention that the staff is soooo kind and helpful.From the Entrance to the Exit they were provided their best services. Specialy I have to mention that Mr.senarathne (GM)doing great Job. And Mr.Thushara Restaurant Manager & Mr.Praveen were very special to us in this evening. They did nice team work.well done sir ! Atmosphere and the Food were so beautiful. We enjoyed nice traditional srilankan show. Definitely we would like to come again !!! Good luck Boys !!!,positive
"We spend the weekend on Heritance and it is a hotel with great landscaping.Has a nice pool and easy access to the beach, we had a sea bath and enjoyed a lot. The rooms are clean and tidy but bathrooms are small. Food was average, restaurant staff except chefs was nice and friendly.There were few chefs at the buffet and most of them were rude and had unpleasant attitudes. The hotel has facilities to play table tennis,carom,pool and has a small book collection as well.",positive
A truly delightful hotel to relax in. Comfortable well appointed rooms and superb food. With a choice of places to eat. The hotel was being renovated while we were there but it did not detract from the relaxed atmosphere. Lovely pool and beach. Service was extremely good. Also the spa added to the experience with amazing treatments on offer.Staff were very attentive and friendly.Look forward to going back.Live music and shows at night too.,positive
"the hotel is situated in a serene and quiet place. Transport is not a problem. Time taken to travel from International Airport to the hotel is a maximum 3 hrs drive(without traffic, since we went early morning around 5 AM). Location is fabulous just on the beach with a fantastic swimming pool. Food spread across for breakfast and dinner was fantastic with equal stress on American and Ceylonese cuisine. The sweet dish was sumptuous. Live music, fire shows in the evening are worth mentioning.",positive
"Hotel situated in a nice quite place with easy access to the beach. The buildings and the surrounding has some old look and it add nice ambiance to the hotel. Swimming pool is also quite nice, it shape like a cross. Must mention the buffet, its one of the best things about this place. Great taste and nice variety ! Here comes the but part, I would have give this place 4.5 or 5/5 if it not for their service and rooms, specially the rooms. we took a deluxe room which had two single beds, we have asked for a one extra bed when we make the reservation. But they haven't put the extra bed when we checked-in, they said they will arrange it. After 4-5 hours we had to make a complain to the reception then only they came up with the extra bed. The biggest worry was the room condition it was no way near the 5 star standard. Room key card doesn't work. Couldn't work out the room safe, the safe itself had different set of instructions compared to the leaflet they gave us on check-in. Tried both of them but no luck.Then they gave us Wi-fi credentials which took 2-3 hours to get activated. The bathroom is covered with glasses, there are blinds but they are jammed and when you put lights on the bathroom you can see the inside. Bathroom door lock was also didn't work. The biggest worry was the shower :/",positive
"Never have I felt the urge to write a review while I'm still staying at a place... But just so that no one else is cheated , I'll do it now... ""Steer clear"" ... We viz. 2 couples with young children were given twin beds in a ""deluxe category"" room... God only knows why... They expect the kid to sleep , hanging in the crevice... The house keeping is extra sloppy... 1 hr to get room slippers (read-only I had to personally go to the store room)... Air con s/w broken... Staff got me phenyl when I asked for an antiseptic (dettol) solution... No idea where the first aid kit is... This is my first 2 hrs at the hotel... What's amazing... All this at a ridiculous price",negative
"This is a very nice hotel to get some rest and recreation, especially for a family with kids. Although the hotel is old, it has some great architectural features. There are courtyards with lush foliage, which gives a cool atmosphere. The grounds are full of trees too, which provides well-needed shade during the daytime. Big pool and the ocean is right next to it. The rooms are also nice and comfortable. The design and interiors are a bit old fashioned, which I personally liked, but not if you are looking for modernism. The staff is very friendly, and the food is quite good, with a lot of variety at all meals. They even had a kids table, which I found very quaint.",positive
"Enjoyed one night stay at this hotel. Hotel looks bit old, but clean, spacious and beautiful. Food is up to the ""Heritance"" standards with so many verities. Main restaurant is crowded and packed sometimes.",positive
"I stayed at the Heritance at the end of October for 3 days. The hotel is beautiful and makes the most of it's stunning surroundings. We opted for half board and were very impressed with the selection of food on offer for breakfast and dinner. The live cooking stations were a great addition. The staff were very friendly and made an effort to remember us and our preferences. The infinity pool is large and lovely, and as we went out of season there were plenty of sun loungers. However there didn't seem enough if the hotel was full. The only downside was the electrics and power points in the room. During our short stay we had three power cuts, the only power sockets in the room that we could use where to power the telly and mini-bar so we would have to simultaneously remove one to be able to charge phones, or straighten hair. The other sockets available didn't fit any sort of travel plug (I'd packed a world compatible one and it still didn't work!) the room comes with a kettle and tea making facilities however even the kettle plug didn't fit in the sockets! Slightly disappointing side to an otherwise lovely hotel.",neutral
"Nice hotel, but getting a bit tired. In need of some renovation. Rooms were comfortable, but had to be moved after first night because our so called de-luxe sea view room was situated immediately above the kitchen and dining rooms. Very difficult to see the sea, due to heavy tree line. Replacement room was much better. Restaurant and food were excellent with great choices every morning at breakfast and then again at dinner in the evening. Staff were very helpful and always with a smile. Service was slow in the restaurant. Bar staff were great. This is not a five star hotel, more between three and four.",neutral
"Great place to entertain business and leissure clients The F&B manager Gamini knows to offer the best for my clients The lobster lunch was great and value for money My Dutch clients mentioned that during their two weeks round tour in Sri Lanka this was their best meal as it was fresh, tasty and the presentation was on the highest level. Thank you Gamini and the team for this tremendous team work. If you are in Down South (in Sri Lanka) worth trying out this hotel as always it's one of the best in the region for many decades",positive
We checked in on the first week of Oct. The check in staff was friendly and welcomed us with a refreshing drink. The room was spacious but we received two single beds for me and my husband. Which I found really ridiculous. They should have inquired regarding this when we made the reservation or at check in. When we asked to change they said the hotel was fully booked. We then asked the housekeeping to dress the beds with a single double bed sheet. Which still didn't make a big difference. The room fridge and the phone was not working. Informed them and they replaced it. The rooms need refurbishment and new equipment. The lunch buffet was not that great. The Srilankan option was good but the other dishes were not tasty. The starter section looked really pathetic. And added to that the prawns were not de-veined. Which was unacceptable. The waiting staff was dazed. We had to ask for water. Nobody escorted us to tables. The staff was basically a little lost. During dinner they had barbecue going on which was good. They had a seafood dish again the most prawns were not de - veined again. Brought it to the attention of the management and informed them that there could be consiquences for consuming non de - veined prawns. They apologised and offered to get something else. I informed them I don't need anything else but to keep the kitchen staff informed regarding this. Breakfast was good and tasty. Again during breakfast the waiting staff was lost. Asked for coffee and never got it. I just left it. The other complaint is to get more high chairs for kids to restaurant because our friends needed a high chair and everything was taken. So if the hotel is full there is no option. But I have to tell that hands down the best buffets to go to for is heritance Kandalama and Negombo. So tasty and great variety.,negative
"Stayed for 2 nights at this hotel. Situated right by the beach this is a beautifully architectural designed hotel keeping up with the Heritance Hotels standards. The room was large with all amenities and a good view of the ocean. A large swimming pool, gym, library and a spa adds value to the hotel. The food was good, specially the breakfast. A fine place to relax and enjoy the beach.",positive
Was there with colleagues we had the best time ever the management gave us a very good treatment we even got our own party place we had drinks by the beach it was simply wonderful we really enjoyed the hotel is Fabulous has a great sea view too,positive
The resort is beautiful and located on the beach. The service and staff make your stay exceptional. The room I had looks out over beautiful scenery and the ocean. The room was clean and stunning. The food and drink excellent. This is a must for an amazing vacation. Try out the spa it's worth it.,positive
"My husband and I have recently returned from our honeymoon here and we have completely fallen in love with it! The hotel is immaculate, the room was spacious (we loved the towel animals) and the view from our balcony was outstanding. Above all each and every member of staff were so friendly and acommodating, we couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. The drive up to the reception has a truly wow factor that continued beyond. Thank you for making our honeymoon so special and memorable. Highly recommended!",positive
"this time its 3rd floor and service on this floor is fabulous. just a learning during my stay that pool and gym are not available before 8 AM so if you are a early morning riser, you have to spend initial hours just roaming around on the beach.",positive
"We wanted a break from this hustle and bustle,and planned a trip,and again ended up in Heritance Ahungalla,a place where we have visited many times,but has never got fed up of.The moment we entered the hotel,the breathtaking beauty of the entrance kept our mind at peace.The service offered by everyone from the reception to the restaurant is superb.They surely know how to entertain guests.The frontline staff showed their talents by their beautiful dancing and hilarious acting.We like to thank Mr.Thushara food and beverage manager,specially for his warm welcome and always making our stay an amazing one.Thank you so much,From Indika,Eshara,and little Sanayah.",positive
"I must admit that I’m totally in love with this place. Starting from the architecture itself which is a marvel by renowned architect Jeoffrey Bawa, from entrance to lobby, hallways, restaurants, pools, rooms are all unique and well thought out. Then the staff, one of the most friendliest and attentive staff, I have ever met in my trips. It would be a great miss, if I didn’t mention about their buffet. Wow, it’s too much and I’m not exaggerating. They have huge spread of mouthwatering local and international cuisine. The main pool is one of the best pools I have seen and sheer size of it made it really easy for us to enjoy without a hassle on a crowded weekend. The deluxe rooms have sea view and they are well equipped to give you total relaxation and satisfactory entertainment. The beach next to the hotel is adequately clean and enjoyable. But the sea is rough during this month and therefore not suitable for sea bath. There are only handful of negatives I can point out about this place. In fact, this is not directly linked to the hotel itself but about making the reservation via phone through Aitken Spence Head Office. They had a credit card offer for locals and I had to go to the head office to make the payment to confirm the reservation, which is a hassle. I seriously suggest them to follow the industry practice of sending online credit card information sheet to be filled and followed by auto deduction from willing parties. Other than that till the end of October there is some construction happening at the premises and it is not at all any hassle to the guests. In fact, I’m sure most of the guests who were there even didn’t notice a construction is in progress. The only negativity about the construction is you cannot use the resident pool during this period. In summary, I’m impressed about Heritance Ahungalla and I have no hesitation in recommending it to anybody who is looking for place for a weekend getaway with the family.",positive
I really like the customer service of this Hotel. Friendly and pleasent looking staff who always wearing a big smile on their faces. Also i liked the food. Rooms are quite and comfortable nice too. But I dont like the welcome drink.,positive
"After a week travelling Sri Lanka it was nice to have this last week enjoying the pool and beach at this excellent hotel. Upon arrival you are always greeted with a hot face towell and a fruit juice, which was the same as all hotels we visited. The hotel facilities are great you have a choice of 3 restaurants unless you choose all inclusive where it is buffet choice only. We chose bed and breakfast only as it gave us the chance to wander to the 2 restaurants by the beach both for lunch of which were well worth a visit and also only so much buffet can eat so we got to try cafe mustard at the hotel which we really enjoyed, we did the buffet and for a similar price of the buffet you can go the 'posh' restaurant which we failed to do so in the end opting on another trip to cafe mustard instead. There is also a wine/off-licence out of the front of the hotel to the right where you can stock up your fridge if you feel the need (the prices will change whenever they see you but still cheap). Prices at the hotel for drinks are reasonable anyway it works less than £3 a pint or less than £5 a cocktail. The guys who work by the pool soon remember you and will set up your beds if you give them a 100 rupees tip (about 60p) each time then you will soon find your bed is ready and waiting for you each morning. The staff cannot do anymore for you, we had the pleasure of meeting Suprani who was fantastic (even organising aqua aerobics for my wife the next day) she is a great asset to to the hotel but also the greeters for the buffet, the staff at Cafe Mustard and the housekeeper who makes animal shapes with towels on the bed and the animation guy were all excellent. Flip side of the experience is the entertainment in the evening. We only stayed Sun-Sat which is typical as Sat seems the best night from talking to those around us. They hide the musicians in a dark corner so they simply become background music. The Friday was good in all fairness with the Sri Lanka dancers. The daytime activities are decent they just need to do more and advertise what could be happening as this would drum up the interest. Lastly have to mention the beach boys who cannot enter hotel premises so stand at the end beckoning you over or waiting for you to walk the beach, they can seem a little intimidating and ruin the experience. I found attack the best cause of defence and went straight to the ringleader Siri on day one. These guys want to take you to gem stores, spice gardens, the local restaurant (where they will also be fed claiming to be your guide) see turtles, see the whales, hsve a massgae or take you in their tuk-tuk. Some people used the beach boys with the outcome you would expect one chap saying his massage was a pretty rough handed experience on his sun burned shoulders. I approached them all sitting together and asked how much for an air conditioned taxi to and from Galle (with no shops/spice gardens) and they agreed 5500 was a fair price. I then went to the hotel taxi was quoted 6000 where he also waited for 4 hours to bring us back and was well worth the 500 more. Later on one of the beach boys said he would of done it for 4000, I still prefer the hotel taxi service for what is £10 more, but if you enjoy a haggle you could have a little bit of fun. All in all an excellent stay however really enjoyed this hotel and would recommend highly just a few tweaks needed only",positive
"I am writing this review sitting at the hotel on our penultimate night. I can honestly say we have utterly enjoyed our stay at this wonderful hotel. From the moment we arrived we have been treated like royalty with the staff always on hand for whatever your needs may be. Firstly, we stayed in room 301 which has wonderful views of the sea and the pool. The bed is comfortable with nice pillows and an adequate bathroom. The housekeeping staff often surprise you with their creativity and knock on your door in the evening asking if you need extra towels which is a nice touch. The food has been delicious with plenty of variety. I can truly say both my husband and I have been in a food coma after every meal. Just when you think it can't get better but the next day it does. The buffet has choices of steak, chicken and plenty of seafood in addition to the traditional curries and local cuisines which are all delightful! Even when you're full you must try the little sweet treats that melt in your mouth! The staff in the restaurant are attentive and you don't have to ask for a drink as they keep it coming. Thank you all the wonderful kitchen and restaurant staff for the first class service! The pool is large and there is always plenty of beds for a lazy pool/beach day. Although the sea is very choppy and the red flag has always been up! The pool bar staff are attentive and often walk around the pool asking for drink orders. The life guards are always smiling and as soon as you're spotted they run over with cushions and towels making it all a lovely experience. There are two things I would like to highlight, the beach isn't private and you get the sellers standing by the beach shouting over trying to get your attention on a regular basis. You learn to ignore this as we understood everyone has to make a living, however there is a group of guys that sit in the corner and as a girl I often felt a tad intimidated as they would stare making me feel uncomfortable. There is a pool security guard that prevents these guys from approaching you by the pool but as soon as you get up or go to the beach they walk by you making it a nuisance. Secondly, there really isn't much of an animation team in this hotel if you're like my husband that enjoys the odd game you will be disappointed and you may just have to settle down with your book and the odd swim! Our overall stay at this hotel has been outstanding! Yes the hotel can do with a makeover but our room was comfortable and you really do get the authentic Sri Lankan experience. I must also add the hotel is always sparkling and the hotel gets regular locals come for a stay! If you want to stay at just another commercial establishment then there is a Riu that's opened next door! My husband and I are keen travellers and we can truly say that Sri Lankan people are the nicest nation we have come across! They can't do enough for you without expecting a tip! Everyone is approachable and makes an effort to get to know you leaving you feeling special. I would highly recommend this hotel with spectacular views and for a relaxing experience. I must add, if you want to explore, there really isn't much to do without the 1 hour taxi ride outside the hotel which we took. Thank you Heritance for looking after us and we look forward to seeing everyone again in the future.",positive
"Good: The food and room facilities were good. The staff is really friendly. Highlights: Swimming pools were great! Love the beach! Bad: At the dinner table, staff was pushing the guests to review hotel by asking for their mobile phones and we found it quite intimidating hence putting 4 stars.",positive
"The food was delicious, rooms were clean and neat. Although the room we stayed was not much large, it had enough space and sufficient accessories. Overall, we had a great, relaxing experience at the hotel. Might visit this place again.",positive
An awesome hotel with an amazing staff. The rooms n food was amazing so where the ever helpful staff when we locked ourselves out of our room many times... lol. Will definitely be back in a heartbeat when we are next in the country!!. Keep up the good work always!!.,positive
"We have been to Heritance Ahungalla many times and like in the past, we had a wonderful time yet again. The hotel is apprx 2.5 hours drive from Colombo. The check in was quick and the reception staff was very helpful in getting us an early check in. They also accommodated all our requests including a ground floor room opening out to the garden and closer to the pool, which the kids enjoyed quite a lot. Food at Spence hotels has always been outstanding, though quality has slightly dropped compared to the past and the main restaurant needs a facelift. However, all in all it had a wonderful weekend.",positive
"Heritance Ahungalla serves up some of the best buffets out of Colombo. Great variety, local and foreign cuisine. Amazing food hands down! Been there several times during the past 5 years and they do not disappoint! highly recommend the place locals and foreigners alike. (They have several ocean facing Suites with a great view)",positive
Its always nice to have resort to come back everytime you visit Srilanka...Heritance Ahungalla is always the best. Service was excellent from front office staff to f/b to housekeeping. A special thank you to Buwaneka - Resident Manager for his personalized attention to detail as well as a warm welcome. Look forward to my next visit...,positive
"A stunning, sprawling hotel with superb Sri Lankan service and food. From the moment you arrive the Geoffrey Bawa designed hotel gives a great sense of connection between the land and the sea beyond. With pools in front of the open plan reception through to a main pool which appears to run straight out into the Indian Ocean - just stunning. A a guest you can use not just this main pool, which is also open to the public, but also the incredible green pool with carefully trained trees branching out over it. The hotel is a great base from which to explore the local area. There is a cab company based on the hotel grounds, but get a little more local colour by walking up to the main gate and hiring one of the tuk-tuk drivers. Remember to agree a price first, and if you are happy with them they will look after you every day you are there - there is no shame in just saying 'NO' if that is not what you want to do.",positive
"This place is just stunning! Such a beautiful entry and pool area. Gorgeous beach which they say you shouldn't swim in because of dangerous currents. Still didn't stop us, although it does stress he lifeguard... Rooms are lovely and service is great. Such friendly people! Not a lot to do in the town, we got a tuk tuk to Bentota (1/2 hour) and did a little bit of shopping. Mainly just a place to come and relax. Wonderful!",positive
"A vast, open resort that we intended to use as a base to travel between Bentota and Hakkaidu before moving on to Galle. Apparently the place was fully booked but a paid upgrade is always available :). As with any resort, this place is fairly self sufficient in keeping the guests entertained. On poya day, they had organised a cultural, fusion dance which was quite enthralling ( I usually walk away from such events) and left us longing for more. Mid sept our options for outdoor activities were a tad limited, the sea was too choppy for Whale watching, had already experienced the river tour which left us with only the local safari. Overall hotel facilities were up to the mark, the huge pool and extensive spa offerings kept us usefully busy the two days we spent at this resort, breakfast/dinner buffet as good as can be expected, overseen by attentive staff. Would recommend this any day.",positive
It is our first time to this hotel. Starting from the welcoming to the checking out everything as perfect. Kids enjoyed a lot.Main pool relaxed our minds and food is awesome.Thank you all! Specially my friend Janaka gave us a good service.Supuni's attention into detail is perfect. Thank you all for making us this much happy!!!,positive
"We were on our honeymoon and really enjoyed our stay in this hotel. Yummy food, friendly staff and the swimming pool with the ocean view are the best things about this hotel.Only issue is that the beach area is open to the general public.",positive
"The hotel facing beach view is very nice but the room we had was in corner on 2nd floor. When we checked in evening we dint notice the water purification unit next to the building which made load noise all the though night. Not that great customer service. We tried to speak to front desk manager, tried serval times and have our call back Number but dint receive any call back.",neutral
We were welcome by the amazing view desinged by geffoery bawa plis with a hint of traditionalism.Wonderful hotel with excellent service...enjoyed a unique and memorable experiece ..Food at jute restaurant and its service is amazing. I should not forget the service from the hidden service from engineering. Service is so quick.Front desk staff is amazing.Thank you so much heritance ahungalle for the memorable stay.,positive
The hotel need an urgent renovation ... Location good but far from center .... 15 mn with a tuktuk ... Pool is clean ... Breakfast and dinner buffet are good .... Entertainment not bad ... All in all is a good place to be for relaxing after a long trip in Srilanka,neutral
"I have wanted to go to the hotel since it was called Trident and finally went when its Hearitance Ahungalla. The friendly and professional staff, good food, fabulous rooms and the unique touch, the Heritance group of hotels has is their with Ahungalla as well. Stayed and Luxury room and it was spacious and quite. it was designed by Jeffery Bava. you can still see the old elevator which was used to supply materials to the upper floors by labours when it was built. Heritance + Jeffery Bava this combination always gives immense happiness and wonderful memories for me.",positive
Enjoyed last weekend at Heritance Ahungalle with my wife. Good hotel. Nice scenic view as the large pool seemingly meets the sea. Quiet place. Great to rest and relax. Food was average for my Sri Lankan pallet. But would be good for foreign visitors as it is less spicy. But on the plus side you are spoiled for choice. 5 stars for the deserts definitely. The only part of the menu we enjoyed. Watch out for in-room dining as there is a variance in pricing. All in all the best thing about the Hotel were it's staff. Every member we met was cheerful and made our stay warm and pleasant.,positive

"This is a five star hotel. We got superb food Night club And soooo many activities However, the old area of the hotel has small rooms which a are not acceptable for a star class hotel at all The new side of the hotel has nice rooms.",neutral
Very nice place. Kid friendly and close to most attractions and water sports etc. The highlight for us had to be the food! Fantastic choice for breakfast and dinners were superb. We did not have lunches here so I can't comment but overall it was excellent. The other thing was the service..everyone was so kind and courteous in the hotel. We were travelling with a kid and infant and they were most helpful. Special mention about Tushara who looked after us. Will visit again soon,positive
Heritance Ahungalla: Heritance Ahungalla is an Ideal place to enjoy with your family. Appreciate their friendly services. International foods as well as Authentic Sri Lankan Cuisine. Thank u Heritance Ahungalla,positive
"This was my second visit to the Hotel and I was not disappointed. All staff I encountered was friendly and helpful. Enjoyed the wide selection of food laid out for the buffet with many options for those are health conscious / vegetarian. Love the architecture / design of the hotel which has an old world charm. This resort hotel being steps away from the beach is also a plus point. I was able to walk along the sea shore. Due to the sea breeze, the corridors of the hotel were damp/slippery however the staff had put up notices to caution visitors. Hotel need to caution guest in a more direct manner about sea-bathing when the sea is rough, as I saw a guest being stuck at sea, unable to come to the shore due to the strong current being rescued by the hotel staff. My only disappointment was that out of the two swimming pools, the less crowded one was not open to gussets due to maintenance. The whole atmosphere of this hotel is laid back ad makes you feel you are in an oasis, cut out of the daily hustle and bustle of city life. Overall it was a wonderful and relaxing holiday.",positive
"We went there with a group of colleges as a company retreat. First impression of the hospitality and hotel surrounding were great. Check in time was 2.00pm but they were kind to give our rooms at their earliest, we received our room at 11.00am. The room is very clean and attractive. we got sea view room in the 3rd floor. When it comes to swimming pool, it is located closer to sea and has a beautiful view. Meals are excellent. was in a huge range. more likely to combination of delicious sea foods.",positive
"Have to say, its not a great hotel in need of some serious updating, lots of new hotels about to open very close by so they either need to up their game or rebuild the place. Beach sellers/beggers were a pest and security didn't seem too bothered with their presence, one lunch time we watched some sneaking in. Buffet restaurant, was not well stocked once the first lots of food was taken, the room didn't seem all that clean, bedrooms were tired, the ala cart restaurant was empty and expensive for the food on offer.",negative
"Went with two kids under the age of five and they thoroughly enjoyed the stay. The sea was very rough and that is always the case on the west coast at this time of the year - so bathing in the sea was out. But we made sand castles, dug for small crabs and enjoyed the beach. The pool is huge and is three feet except for the deep section which is clearly mentioned. we and our kids enjoyed the pool, although we did miss not having a baby pool where the kids could play more freely. The food was good - the breakfast and lunch menus were more enjoyable than the dinner. All in all, a place we will definitely go back to.",positive
The place is really quiet and nice with the sea view. I have been their twice. They also upgrade my room for my second visit without any additional charge (with the availability) . I also participated their earth hour celebration. The food was awesome . They have huge varieties. Staff was so friendly and helpful.,positive
"We had 2 nights here. Very good customer service. but need to give some feedback about the buffet in main restaurant, their is no large verity of foods. i was there for my birthday. they were arrange me a surprise birthday cake.Thanks for a lovely surprise. Room 329 is superb.",positive
"I recently visited Heritance with a group of friends after my wedding in Sri Lanka. We stayed there for 3 nights. The hotel itself was comfortable, with all the necessary amenities. The highlight was definitely the pool, which was great as the monsoon meant swimming in the beach wasn't possible. Another highlight was the quality of food at the dinner buffet which had great variety. The hotel has been there for a number of years and it turns out Aitken Spence (the company which owns the hotel) is opening another large hotel just down the road in the coming months. This may explain the ""tired"" state of Heritance as it seems like there hasn't been a lot of recent investments. Another disappointment was the lack of evening entertainment. Because Ahungalla itself is secluded with very little night life or day time options (compared to Hikkaduwa or Bentota) it was a shame that the night time activities were so limited. The only options we found were a tired lounge bar, and quiet pool side bar. When I compare it to other hotels in Bentota which had more live music and more bars it was disappointing.",neutral
"very friendly staff specially need to mention Mr. Thushara Gnanarathna (Restaurant & Bar Manager) setting a example for rest of the staff, tasty food & lot to choose had good time. I have recommend my friends & family to have nice hotel experience @ Heritance Ahungalla.",positive
"We arrived at Ahungalla Heritance for our anniversary. The arrival drinks were custom made for us, which was a treat from the random fruit drink we would normally receive at other hotels. We got room 208, which is a wonderful suite facing the ocean and gardens. They provided a cot for our son and there were enough sofa's to sleep our other child. We got a triple room and did full board. If you do not do full board, the cafe has a great menu for lunch. I inquired about all inclusive packages and was quoted 5100 rupees per person for all you can drink. This only includes local brands of hard liquor. Each drink typically costs 500-750 rupees, so It would be the equivalent of 6 drinks/person. We opted to simply purchase when we were thirsty. The buffet has been one of the best we have been too. The service is impeccable and they are very attentive to the kids. They offer us kids items such as fries, ice cream even though not on the buffet to ensure our kids are happy. The food has been very tasty and high quality. I cannot say enough about the restaurant service and Pravin the manager of the food services has been very attentive. The pool is nice and the seating lines the pools. I don't like how locals hover at the edge of the resort beach hoping to sell us on tours, etc.. They are not too bothersome, in that you just say no and they leave you alone, it just feels odd. I would recommend this hotel and if you have children, certainly feel comfortable to book room 208 which has ample of room for your family. The bathtub is a jetted tub and our kids loved bubbles baths after a long day at the pool It was actually a hi light for them.",positive
"Traveled with family for my mom's birthday. All of us had a wonderful holiday special mention to the beautiful, clean beach. My 15month old toddler loved everything about this hotel the beach the pool etc was a bit worried about the room condition as the hotel is a bit old but no problem what so ever... Keep up the great work....",positive
"We had 5 nights here with 3 adults and 2 kids. After a bit of a slow check in and having to swap rooms because of renos, we settled in and had a merry old time. Fab swimming pool and warm, friendly and very helpful staff. The food was terrific, we ate in all the restaurants in this hotel. The amazing team in the kitchen cooked us up some top seafood nosh. Loved the beach dining. There were a few niggling issues with a lack of hot water hot water and dodgy door locks but that aside I would not hesitate to recommend. Ware the beach boys prowling the shore, ready to pounce, and I don't recommend swimming in the surf, massive undertow!!",negative
"This is a beautifully set out hotel, it has 2 swimming pools, the deluxe rooms were excellent. We meet DK the chef on our second night there, he is a decorated chef, he had great pleasure in showing us around his vast kitchen, the chocolate room is a must. Thank you very much for showing us your little museum, it was one of the highlights of our trip. And congratulations to you and your staff for all your awards. We did the boat trip on the Madu River, was ok, ensure you have plenty of money for tipping.",positive
I had a problem when I was having a shower. Water suddenly stopped. I informed the operator twice and waited for more than 15 minutes. No one came so I could not finish my shower :(. The bell boy was very careless. I personally told him to be careful with my CK bag. Not to put it on floor. When The bag is inside the room I noticed dust marks on the bag :( Food is good. Gym and swimming pool is good too. Other staff members were acceptable and one front office staff member was exceptional (Kanishka).,negative
A quaint 36 years old very well maintained beach resort Hotel with one of the finest and largest infinity swimming pools! The only problem was that the exhaust in the bathrooms was not working. Each room faces pool and some rooms face the sea too. The food ( especially the sea food) was excellent at this people.,positive
wonderful place to relax. We went there for a nice meal and the service was superb along with the food. Great place to have a nice meal and relax by the pool. There are large open areas with great views of the ocean so nice at night to take a walk on the beach which is wide.,positive
"We only went here to hangout at the cafe and to check out the architecture. The architect of this phenomenal hotel was Geoffrey Bawa. It has a classic feel and just heading in through the gates take you back in time. For all those who love the arts and aesthetics this place is a must, even if for an afternoon visit. We sat here for a couple of hours just to relax and unwind, sipping at our coffee and nibbling on some snacks. It was lovely just sitting there by the poolside and watching it simply become a part of the great visual expanse of the sea. It was almost surreal being there, knowing that this historic building had withstood the Tsunami although apparently the entire ground floor has generally been swept away. We never got to see the rooms, although we did tour the hotel going up a couple of floors and taking quite a few pics there. It was simply exquisite just being there. Great ambiance and welcoming and polite staff. Majority of the crowd here seemed to be Westerners and Arabs.",positive
This is a older hotel but we enjoyed staying here. It has a lovely big pool. The water was so warm. The hotel could do with a reimbursement as the furniture is a bit old. We visited the Brief gardens and house of Bevis Bawa. THis was very interesting and full of history.,positive
"A place with a beautiful set up. Food is commendable. Two pools. Very good customer service. Valentine's day and other theme nights are celebrated. Suites are available such as Tendulkar. Had an amazing experience. Tasted chili chocolates. Lobster thermidor is done exceptionally well. ""Yara tea"" is also prepared. A must visit as it leaves nostaligic experiences.",positive
"This place is awesome. Very friendly, helpful staff. Rooms were immaculate and the towel origami animals on the beds at night were fantastic. The restaurant had everything and if they didn't you cold ask and they would be happy to make it for you. We asked for butter chicken one night as it wasn't in the buffet and within minutes it was on our table. The two pools were pristine and no one seemed to mind when the kids made a bit of noise and a splash. Loved the beach and the surf was pretty good for body surfing. Remember to get out before dark or the sea snakes will get you. There's a nice private adults bar which made a good escape from the kids. Plenty to do for everyone. Excellent all round. Can't wait to go back!",positive
"This hotel, designed by the renowned architect Geoffrey Bawa, is about 30 years old (or more), and at the time it was built it was the leading hotel in the South West coast and despite the addition of numerous other hotels since, it remains very competitive.The ""infinity"" pool when seen as one enters the hotel appears to stretch into the horizon. The hotel is well-patronised. wi-fi in rooms is free.",positive
Second time here since the last time in 2011. Read my full review as that still stands though all the renovations have been completed. Still a lovely hotel and enjoyed it even more with a large group and used more of the facilities. This time around I tried buffet at Lunch and Dinner - WOW - lovely lovely food. Especially the curries. Full international on offer too and so much too choose from and the sweet bar was laden. All in All a lovely weekend at a lovely location and hotel. :-),positive
"This is a beautiful property with incredible views.They have 2 large swimming pools and plenty of amenities to keep you occupied. This is our last night but we have had a great stay. Check in was great with Khan , he was helpful and very gracious. We had one of the suits with incredible views. Their buffet needs improvement , increasing live cooking stations, better service. The pool Bar and Mustard were great. I ENJOYED my meals there. Housekeeping was great and Staff were wonderful and warm. The hotel will need to advertise their other dinning venues as they are better , with good service and great food. I think its a great property stretched on large piece of land and does not appear too crowded We loved the location and Ambience An issue I had was looked after promptly by Duty manager. Thank you",positive
Stayed for 02 nights and had an awesome relaxing time. The hotel has its own beach and a superbly designed swimming pool by Geoffery Bawa overlooking the beach.The staff is very friendly and helpful..,positive
"We only stayed for 2 days but it was super relaxing and enjoyable. We were upgraded to a better room in arrival and it was a pleasant surprise. Our room was on the top floor with a gorgeous view of the sea. The room was big, clean and tidy. It had plenty of room for our 1 1/2 year old son to prance around which was a big plus point. Bathroom was also very clean and neat with all required amenities. The breakfast, lunch and dinner buffet has a huge spread of dishes including so many seafood dishes as well. I have to mention that they had a little buffet type thing for kids as well with finger food and little sweet treats. This was ideal for our son and he enjoyed the food. The pools are well kept and clean. Overall the stay was very enjoyable. One tiny thing I need to mention is the lighting in the room. It was a little dark as the lights are all set with shades. Other than that it was a really enjoyable stay and would highly recommend it to anyone.",positive
"This property claims to be a 5 star property. Yes there is a 24 hour coffee shop etc but they have many things to fix before they can claim to be in par with 5 star resort properties in the Asian region. For example the ugly garden, dirty exterior walls and the nasty smells in the lobby and the lifts. The old fashioned keys to the rooms with only one key the double and triple rooms too where guests have to juggle that single key among themselves to leave or access the room. The minibars that are not stocked as on the list and the sizeable spider we had in one room. The in-room and poolside rain showers that don't have enough pressure and the pool that doesn't open until very late in the morning. Having said all that, the staff are super courteous. They go out of the way to anticipate the needs of guests and help often. There were lots of such instances. One morning I was stranded outside the room wet and cold, because of their one key issue and a supervisor passing by got the door opened for me to get in even without my making a request. The main restaurant has only a full dinner buffet priced at Rs 3,000 ++ , much dearer than even the best of the best in Colombo and they don't serve a-la-carte. So while dining in the Coffee shop we casually asked the Supervisor whether the main restaurant's buffet catered for ""starters only"" or ""desserts only"" diners as many 5 star hotels in Colombo do. That was not the norm at this hotel. However, within a few minutes the Supervisor had spoken to her Boss and got approval for us to have a Dessert buffet in the main restaurant at a very nominal price per head. her name was Gayathri and throughout the stay we saw her working her magic with other guests too and keeping an eye on all the tables. The rooms are nice and comfortable. The mattresses and bed linen excellent. The quality of the towels though can improve a little to vie for 5 star quality. Yes, the tea/coffee making stuff need to be hidden away, but they can be made more user friendly with an easily accessible plug point and one with the correct sized and shaped holes, some liquid milk in the fridge etc.",positive
"We wanted a quiet beach holiday, not bothered where in the world and found the Heritance Ahungalla which seemed to be just what we wanted. We booked our holiday as a package through Travelbag with flights, accommodation and private transfers. The flights were with Sri Lankan Airlines and we were able to get a great price for Business Class so treated ourselves.. After a two hour journey from the airport we arrived at the hotel and it looked even better than it did in any photo that we saw when researching our holiday. We were taken room 202 which is an Ocean Front Deluxe room. The location was great, close to everything and no noise issues. Some reviews had mentioned that the rooms were getting a bit tired but our room was fine. For nine of the ten nights of our holiday our room attendant was the amazing Saman who kept our room spotless and also presented us with towel art every day. There was a minor maintenance issue that was quickly fixed after a phone call. We were able to see a renovated room while we were there and while it was very nice we didn't feel like we were missing out an anything with our room. We were on an all inclusive package and loved the variety of food and drink available. There was more than enough choices at the restaurant for all meals and there seemed to be plenty of choices for people on dietary restrictions. On our package wine was only available at meal times but there were plenty of drink choices at the pool bar to keep us happy. We were there during the quiet season so the amazing pool seemed empty most of the time, tour groups used the hotel but they were mainly only there in the evenings. Often it was the case that there would be 46 guests in the restaurant for lunch and then over 250 for dinner, at no time did this affect the high service standards. There are local traders on the beach selling tour and souvenirs. We did go on tour to Yala booked through a beach trader after he was recommended by another guest and while we had a great day in hindsight we would have preferred to use one of the hotel drivers. We used a hotel driver to go to Galle a few days later and his driving standards were so much better and we then realised that we should have used him for Yala. The hotel does not seem to push excursions but reception has a price list if you ask. The WiFi seemed very good. WiFi passwords are available from reception, each device needs it's own code and you will need a new password after 7 days. The staff were all always helpful and friendly and all helped us to have a lazy holiday!",positive
"I have been visiting Heritance Ahunghalla ( formerly Triton Ahunghalla) since I was a small kid as my parent favorite holiday destination was this hotel. In the good old days it took a 3 to 3 1/2 hours to travel from Colombo , but now with the southern highway you can come in 45 minutes. The hotel has sustained its quality in service and comfort over the years and the food served is among the best rated in any hotel in the island in terms of taste and variety. The staff is extremely good and I specially appreciate Mr. Thushara Manager F&B who was extremely nice to us and my little baby , constantly ensuring that our stay was pleasant. What i like most about Heritance is the unending breeze that you get near the pool and reception area , this breeze is such a pleasing experience.",positive
"I like this hotel . Not only me my wife and even my daughter. Sice this was our 4th stay felt more comfortable. Got free upgrade. Food was not that great ( dinner), but breakfast was ok. I love the pool.",positive
"Great Place, Friendly staff, good food, large Pools, lots of places and things to do nearby. Rooms are fairly large and the Suits have nice different themes and all are excellent . They go out of their way to make sure you have a pleasant stay and upon request will arrange special Romantic dinners and cater to many other requests as well. overall Loved it.",positive
"We visited the last two weeks of June and we had an amazing stay. The hotel was superb.... Everything from the the design of the hotel... It's beautiful pools... And the staff who just can not do enough for their guests. Uppal the general manager is so helpful and I am sure he is totally proud of all his staff. We loved the wildlife in the grounds.... From monkeys to iguanas around the pool to the sweet little squirrels which my husband fed daily and they all followed him around. The staff who do the rooms and look after you around the pool and in the bars just want to deliver first class service and they do. We ate in the main buffet restaurant and also in the a la carte restaurant a few times.i have food allergies and the chefs could not stop trying to deliver me special food... It became a joke that I always ended up with a least 3 plates of food in front of me. One lady who was lovely and ensured that we were always happy where ever we were eating was Gayathri.... She was so friendly. And it was lovely to hear all about her wedding next year. The hotel is next to the beautiful sandy beach which we loved walking along. If I could just change one thing it would be to get Uppal to get his staff down to the beach and spend an hour filling bin liners with all the rubbish that is being washed up , due to the flooding and rubbish going into the rivers and then into the sea. Myself and my husband, our daughter and her fiancé will definitely be returning as this was a holiday which certainly met our wishes and more.",positive
"Best food, superb rooms, having 2 pools and really exclusive, beachfront and can walk on the beach, beautiful architecture of the hotel & very friendly and helpful staff. One time in life to experience this hotel usca must.",positive
"Third visit Food is as always the Best and the service has been always good exceptional , stayed for two nights and was amazing just mentioning Diyabath on the previous day , it was available the next days breakfast ( A Sri lankan traditional dish made from Red Rice cooked mixed with raw onion and green chili with fresh coconut cream) Need a Facelift to the place very badly , place needs renovation ! Pool sides needs more attention from staff ! Enjoyed the Special Sri Lankan Show !",positive
"The hotel was great with a fantastic sea view. The rooms were large, clean and comfortable. The service was excellent from the arrival. The buffet was the best with a huge spread. They got variety of choices and a wide range. The pool was very nice and overall a wonderful place to relax.",positive
"One of the best hotel located on the west coast of Sri Lanka. Vast, luxurious, spacious, multi pools, many bars across the property located 45 minutes north of Galle and 2 and 1/2 hours south of Colombo Airport via the new Express way. Great beach. Lovely gardens. The rooms are large, well appointed, with lots of wood all around. Nice spa attached to the hotel. Friendly and helpful staff",positive
"I visited with my family and kids loved the hotel... Nice location, very friendly staff and clean, neat rooms... We were given an upgrade too. Nice pools and delicious food.Had a lot of variety in dinner buffet... Worth every cent we spent.",positive
Visited with family for a day out. The staff was very friendly and extremely helpful. The pool has gorgeous views of the ocean. The best part is that it's enormous so there's tons of space. The lunch buffet is top notch. The spread was huge and despite going late for lunch there was plenty of food. Waiters could be more attentive to tables as we had to repeatedly request them to refill our glasses. A special mention should go to Supuni at the front desk for going out of her way accommodate us. Plus she takes amazing photos!,positive
"We have stayed in this hotel during August 2015. Hotel is on a very nice location, though property is a bit old. Rooms are nice but insist on sea-view rooms which are closer to beach. Property is stretched on a large area and if you got the room at the other corner, it becomes painful to walk each time you want to go to room, so it is better to take room near reception. Poolside area was nice and hotel has multiple well managed pools. Food was also nice and there are lots of options to choose from.",positive
"We finally decided to give this hotel a shot as we were traveling through the area mainly due to its architecture (Jeffrey Bower design) and location. Sadly this place failed us. Trivago lists the room that we were given for around $90 US. We paid $175 per night for the two day stay with the full understanding that we'll be getting a decent room. I was expecting much better accommodations given it's the off season and the hotel in near empty. Firt room we got was so bad that I refused it immediately. They then moved us to a different ""deluxe"" room, as I was told, which was marginally better than the first one. The bathroom is dirty, no bath robes in the room and the view is sub par. The room is located in the far corner of the hotel. It is a smoking room and we were not offered the option to choose whether we needed a smoking room or not. It's puzzling to me that the hotel staff felt this room is consistent with a 5 star hotel. I'd rate this place and our experience at 3 stars at best! I've given them two opportunities to rectify the situation and they utterly failed both times. They've had a golden opportunity to wow us and grantee a repeat customer but for some reason, that I still can't understand, they chose to make sure that we will not come back again. In this copetitive field, where there are many other options availabe, the accommodation we've received is not what I had expected from a Heritance chain (Kandalama in contrast was fantastic). We'll be in this country 3 more days and was hoping to to spend it in this area had they met our expectations. Instead we'll be moving to the Hilton in Colombo for the remainder of our stay. Needless to say that this is the first and the last time for us in this perticular facility. Situation of this type do not warrant a third chance. To the management team... look very closely into the culture that is set forth. I don't think you can afford to have customers like us, who travel all over the world and are often in Sri Lanka, to be this dissatisfied with your facilities. Every one that complains on a site like this, ten goes without taking the time to do so yet they are just as dissatisfied. You're alianating the very customers that is your life blood. This is an absolute self inflicted wound.",negative
Good food and good service. by the way rooms are not so spacious comparing other Srilankan 5*s.. We booked a triple room it's basically just adding foldable single bed to the double room. So the space become limited. And it's time for renovation. And it's fare to mention here that we were bit annoyed at reservation at head office that they rejected to apply the out of the season discount for gift voucher. the voucher is paid in full by cash and its obviously equal to cash. And I had to convince them to apply the discount. Which is not fare and ethical by the way all the hotels gives big discounts this season for locals.,positive
"Travelled here for 2 nights stay with friends which was an utter disappointment, been an Atkins group hotel we expected more valued services. There's is so many things wrong in this hotel firstly The rooms, I have been to so many hotels I have not seen such a dirty room, from the kettle to the floor is filthy if you are looking for basic hygiene this isn't the hotel to stay. Broken plug points, toilet leaking underneath, shower door with full of dried soap marks, and many other issues as on pictures.",negative
To all the staff members at Heritance Ahungalla. Both of us would like to thank you all very much for your kind support throughout our stay. You guys were such an amazing team from friendliness to well experienced service. Food was delicious with a great variety. We had a lovely time. Hope to come again. Highly recommend the hotel....Room 321,positive
A excellent hotel with an excellent staff.The food is extraordinary and the two swimming pools by the beach are splendid and the beautiful beach just a few yards away. We enjoyed every second of our stay.A must visit place indeed!,positive
"Friendly helpful staff, good banter. They shared the hidden treasures of the hotel kitchen and showed us their collection of food sculptures. Lovely pool and beach. Food amazing, especially the seafood. Thank you for the fantastic experience.",positive
"Buffet for 3 meals, great variety. Very good access to beach. Large beach. Rooms are nice and well maintained. Views are not that beautify or unique, but lean and nice. Large hotel with lot of rooms. Some times had to walk long distance to get to the room. We booked 2 rooks and they allocated us 2 rooms apart, bit disappointing. Staff seems bit confused at time. We arrived early. They first told us to take the lunch and then later go to rooms. then when we went to take lunch, buffet staff told us lunch is open in another 40 mins. Then we went back to reception and they arranged us to go to our rooms. Ideally, staff should know at what time the buffets are opening and advice customer accordingly. Seems they did not know which time the lunch is opening.",positive
one of best hotel we stayed in our sri lankan holiday. and the beach was perfect and peaceful. staff was friendly and helpful always. around the hotel you can see local life and villages. i will recommend this lovely hotel to any travels in Ahungalla area. Thank you.,positive
Hotel has great sea view good veg food staff is helffull and keeps their best to keep guest happy some rooms are not up to mark due to small ants hotel organises events to keep the guest busy. Location is also good thanks to all staff members for making our holiday memorable,positive
"On our way from Colombo to Galle we stopped by this establishment without prior reservation. The grand driveway and facade of the Heritance Hotel where impressive at first sight. Having arrived there the good impression faded quickly. The room rate given at the reception was US-Dollar 140 per room without breakfast, which is expensive for the island, but we accepted without a written receipt. First of all we had to wait over 1 hour to get the room. By that time the dinner was about to finish, so we were advised to go to the restaurant where a buffet was presented. The quality of the dishes were far from higher standards. The room was alright, but nothing special. The hotel was crowded with tourist groups from China. The next morning by the tome of check-out a bill was presented of 280 US-Dollar. The chef concierge refused to get the man on duty from yesterday night. The outrageous room rate was ompared by us with rates shown on booking sites. The same night rooms had been available from 58 US-Dollar! After were rude discussions we left the hotel with a ""discount"" of 60 US-Dollar and paid incredible 220 US-Dollar. A never come back experience!",negative
Travelled here to part of our office annual trip and certainly lived upto the expectations. The rooms are well maintained and face the sea. Our room located in 4th floor(some staffers say 'sachchin's suite) that faced the sea and the wind blowing towards us. What I liked most was the pool which was amazing in the evenings. It faced the sea and gives a stunning sight towards sunset.,positive
"What a lovely place, we have had a great room which was in direct view of the pool and sea, we also had a room close to the bar which we personally liked as we could sit on our balcony and listen to the music. The food was amazing and if you meet the head chief he will want to give you the tour of his kitchen and will make a point of making you feel special with cooking something fresh for you. The entertainment was interesting on some nights and was not to our taste. We used the gym every day which was awesome and had a fantastic view of the pool. This is the pool we used in the day as it was quieter, if you get one close to the gym the bar does open up for you on occasion but not very often. I would return as I really enjoyed it. We did the turtle sanctuary and safari which was good.",positive
Travelled here to spend 3 days and the hype certainly lived upto the expectations. The rooms are well maintained and face the sea. Our room had a corridor that faced the sea and the wind blowing towards us. What I liked most was the pool which was amazing in the evenings. It faced the sea and gives a stunning sight towards sunset.,positive
From the moment you arrive till your departure the hospitality is amazing. All the staff is very friendly. The food is lovely. The hotel atmosphere is breath taking. The spa is also superb... I will definitely visit again...,positive
"Designed by Sri Lanka's most influential architect, Geoffrey Bawa, Heritance Ahungalla sits in a quiet tropical location on one of Sri Lanka's untouched beaches. Quieter than it's neighbouring Bentota, Ahungalla is a perfect location to get away from it all. With light and airy rooms and spacious, tree-lined corridors, the hotel, along with its show-stopping infinity pool blends seamlessly with its surrounding tropical landscape and the Indian Ocean beyond. We spent 2 blissful days lounging around the different spaces the hotel had to offer. Three restaurants, spacious rooms with balconies, numerous reading rooms and the poolside mean that there is enough space to ignore (if not completely avoid) the package holiday crowds should you wish. Bike hire is a good way to explore the surrounding countryside. I understand that there are plans to renovate the hotel. I hope the updates are respectful of the hotel's charming heritage.",positive
"We stayed the night in a luxury room with a huge sitting/dining area and a separate king bedroom area. Lots of space for our little ones. Room was well appointed and amenities as listed on hotel website. Eventhough bathroom was good size, the raised up jacuzzi tub with an overhead shower was impratical. Literally need to climb in and out of the tub. We didn't experience the award winning cuisine from the buffet dinner. (Extremely salty grilled prawns, burnt BBQ meat. Poor food presentation). Breakfast was a tad better. Our benchmark was the dinner buffet at Heritance Kandalama. That's what we called award winning. We enjoyed the two pools and the wonderful beach right at the hotel doorstep. The service from the staff was excellent. Hotel ground was beautiful with a majestic view of the Indian Ocean especially from the lobby. Recommended if you get a good deal otherwise not worth paying the high price as this is 3.5 stars not luxury 5.",neutral
"Good property, nice location with some good team to take care of guests. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay as team there was always ready to help. On a suggestive note....since other properties are coming up in vicinity as well, need to improve rooms a bit and increase menu as well. Rest....perfect property and recommended.",positive
We have just returned from our first trip to Sri Lanka. We had a wonderful time and Sri Lanka is stunning. We stayed at the Heritance Ahungalla expecting a little bit more than we got however the biggiest disappointment was how dirty and aged the rooms were. There was no bath and the shower was filthy as was the rest of the room. My son on the first night was sick (not sure how) however we asked that the room be fully cleaned the next day which is was not. You could still see the smears of sick on the floor from where we had cleaned during the night. The bed sheets were also stained and did make you wonder if the sheets were clean stains or not. The corridors to the rooms were also in a poor condition and looked more like the corridors on a run down housing estate (I can say that as I lived on one for 5 years). The bathroom amenities are also just refills with dirty lids so make sure you bring your own! However!! The staff were amazing and so attentive and the natural beauty of Sri Lanka makes it all worth while. Would we go back to the same hotel? No! Would we go back to Sri Lanka? Yes! Yes Yes! Special mention to Sri Lankian immigration too who are so friendly. Looking forward to returning to Sri Lanka.,negative
I wud say no hotel has impressed me.so much. From. The hotel staff to the kitchen staff all were very helpful and friendly. This was my second d visit. Food was superb as always. Wud visit again definitely.,positive
We can this hotel fully recommended. Service staff and everybody in this hotel was excellente. Food was delicious and different every day. My husband had birthday celebration and received from hotel birthday cake. For my next trip I will choose this hotel again,positive
"We stayed at this hotel for 10 nights. Our room was with a kitchen view and smell. Our room was certainly not delux. 2 main pools, beautiful beach with golden sand. Very tasty food and poolside bar had wonderful cocktails. Kindly and helpful staff. I'm not sure if I would award this hotel 5 stars. It is perhaps closer to 4 -. Don't expect a high 5 star experience. And - be carefull with some tuk-tuk guys on the beach. Remember - you are here just walking cash machine. Enjoy!",positive
"We had not been to this Hotel in over a year but decided to stay for one night on a credit card offer. Used to be a good hotel even prior to rebanding but I think its now at its best ever. Right from the relaxed check in where you are seated and the forms are brought to you whilst being served with a cold tower and fresh juice, you know there is attention to detail. The service is almost preemptive and is always with a smile wherever you go. Two swimming pools mean you can usually find your quiet corner somewhere. Helps that this hotel is blessed with one of the best stretches of beach on the Southern cost, with pure golden sand. The highlight for me was the food though.I honestly havent seen a hotel execute gourmet level food for mass consumption at buffets the way it was done during our stay. The type of produce the Chef is given is amazing (think Lamb, Duck, Giant Lagoon prawn etc) however I have been to hotels where the kitchen isnt quite sure what to do with such produce. After two stunning ""buffet"" meals better than some of the gourmet gastronomic meals we have tried at Colombo restaurants I actually asked to meet the head Chef, and was introduced to Roshan Pujitha. Chef Roshan was really friendly and willing to share whatever secrets he could. The secret to pulling off amazing dishes in both meals was using fewer ingredients and matching the sauces perfectly to the main. The highlights ranged from roast lamb falling off the bone with mint sauce, tempura prawns with the perfectly crisp batter and giant lagoon prawn with a delightful cheese sauce to spicey pork ribs with pineapple. Not trying too hard to overeach but going to with the well recognized methods of preparations whilst matching the sauces perfectly, the kitchen staff here are really special. At dessert time the hits kept coming, one of the best dark chocolate mousses with low sugar (using low sugar here as opposed to the customary uber sweet desserts in Sri Lanka is something the chefs here have mastered) led the way ably followed by a divine banana custard, a mango panacotta, a milk chocolate, caramel and biscuit base slice, each bang on point and a sparkling example of how to keep dessert light, fresh and easy on the pallet after a heavy meal. I am sorry I am going over the top here with the food but honestly I have been so disappointed at falling standards of buffet fare at the bigger hotels in Sri Lanka recently (even in the capital Colombo) that I wanted to give a special pat on the back to Chef Roshan and his team The room was comfortable. A comfortable library with some English books (mostly foriegn languages though) and a gym (which I obviously didnt use, as it looked far to healthy) I think most rooms have ocean views, but if not it is worth asking for. Wifi is free and fast. One thing to note is that it can be quite a walk for meals, its worth asking for a room close to the lobby lift area if you are with kids or other guests who have difficulty in walking I sincerely hope the Hotel and the Group is able to retain their staff and keep them happy. We saw lots of high end tourists from all over the world and I am sure that will continue as long as Heritance Ahungalla continues to do everything right. 5 Golden Stars!",positive
"We stayed at this hotel for ten nights earlier this month. The setting is superb and the hotel was beautiful. The sea was too rough to swim in but the hotel pools made up for this. In fact the main pool is one of the most beautiful we have seen. Our room was very good with a sea view. We went bed and breakfast and the breakfast options were varied. We ate a few nice meals at the reasonably priced a la carte restaurant but mostly used a couple of local restaurants a short walk up the beach. Our favourite was The Sunshine about a quarter of a mile up the beach to the right - basic, but lovely food and a great atmosphere. Ahungalla is a small fairly quiet place but we did a couple of trips and would really recommend going up to the hill country and Kandy, Tooth Temple and taking in the elephant orphanage and other places on the way. It is quite a long trip for one day, but well worth it.",positive
"We stayed two nights over a weekend. At the very beginning we were disheartened by a welcome which made us feel inferior to foreigners. Room was well decorated. However, they have not met over request to provide us with a king size bed, but only provided two attached single beds. Balcony overlooking the beach added value to the stay. Restaurant and food was superb with lots of variations in local and continental cuisine. Selection of wine range was good. Candle light dinner at the beach can be arranged by a request. Due to rain we were unable to do that. Poolside bar had wonderful cocktails. Enjoyed the night time cultural events. Visit to Madu Ganga and Turtle Hatchery can add extra value to your journey during the hotel stay.",positive
The pool and the Beach was so relaxing and it was a nice stay for us in this hotel. The staff was also very kind and helpful. The buffet was very delicious with many varieties and I highly recommend everyone to Visit this beautiful place ❤,positive
"Visited the hotel in Jan with my extended family members. We we upgraded to a luxury room on the arrival and it was really nice. In the evening there was a magic show followed by some snacks for kids and they really enjoyed it. As usual buffet is really good with lot of choices. Pool , Beach and the surrounding offers a lot to enjoy the holidays...",positive
We visited as a family with our 21/2 yr old daughter.loved t pool though there was no baby pool.food was great and the chefs personally attended to our daughter's preferences too.rooms were comfortable.altogether a great place to stay,positive
"When we arrived we were taken to a room that clearly wasnt set up for us and our two kids. Not only was no baby beds set up, we could not commit to the room as it was too dangerous for our kids. The balcony had steps to railing, which meant our 1 year old could jump or climb over. There were holes i the railing where our 1 year old could slip through. We then spent almost 2 hours looking for another suitable room. Its been horrible as the only room they could put us in has no floor space to walk as the infants beds and pram take up the entire room. Im so sad that i bought my family here on a holiday as its horrible. They are moving us rooms but this is costing a lot more. This place is not for families.",negative
"The place is beautiful although can get crowded during peak holidays/weekends. the rooms are comfortable big and luxury as well. However, was not a big fan of the widely spread buffet as nothing tasted exceptional. It was average for the price paid. Other than that a great place to spend your holiday",neutral
This was I think our 10 th visit since inception in 1984. The grandeur has not diminished much with time & the hotel is due for a overhaul perhaps next year. The food as always was excellent both in the main dining area & the coffee shop. We met Gamini the f&b manager & his deputy Thushara whom we first got to know at the sister hotel in Kandalama in the 1990's-they both recognised us & made our stay that much more enjoyable-thank you. hoping to revisit when next in this beautiful Island perhaps next year,positive
"One night stay on the 14th and we wished we could have stayed few more days ... Beautifully Engineered hotel surrounded by the natures beauty overlooking the ocean ,. We were given a free upgrade and it made our trip even more splendid , food is always awesome practically at all Heritance resorts. Friendly staff and always at your service , I would recommend anyone to first speak to Chathuranga the front office executive who is a very nice and kind boy, always gives priority to guests and looks into all their needs to make the guests holiday joyful, his Courteous and beautiful personality helps brighten overall the entire hotel and its image, I guess people like him should exists at all hotel sectors to make the guests have the assurance of a comfortable stay and have no regrets in choosing that particular hotel for a holiday at all.",positive
"We had 3 nights here at the end of our 16 day tour of Sri Lanka. Lovely big pool in the main part of the hotel ideal for all the family. Comfortable rooms although noise from the floor above came through our ceiling. The buffet restaurant could be very noisy so we found the cafe more to our taste, although being open sided with it's own music it was a little jarring on the ears when there was other music coming across from the pool bar. Staff very helpful. We left for the airport feeling a bit pushed as reception rang our room at 11.30 asking us to vacate, even though check out time was given as 12.",positive
"We went on an extended weekend break with friends to Srilanka and booked this place based on the recommendation given by a friend. Heritance Ahungulla truly gives you the best nature's experience with infinity pool right at the entrance and greener belt around with a view of the beach right in the front... They are also environment friendly and have taken care of the same in each room as well in terms of the space,ambience and toiletries usage... Only drawback is the food which I felt was just about fine..In terms of quantity there was enough but in terms of quality and service by the staff at the restaurant it needs a bit of improvement...but the warmth by the people and staff overcomes these drawbacks... However, overall the experience is brilliant as they have full fledged itinerary for each day activities and staff keeps you engaged throughout....",positive
"The entrance of the hotel puts into a state of peace. The pool starts from the reception lobby and ends next to Indian Ocean. The expanse stretches from the lobby to the horizon. The staff puts you to ease and takes care of filling the forms. This is just the beginning. The restaurant, the bar, the pool - everything is quite enthralling. The regular list of guests include Cyrus Broacha of Mtv fame. The pool was very relaxing. Diwali vacations well spent there. The biggest letdown of the hotel are the washrooms. The walls of the washrooms are Transparent GLASS. On expressing our disappointment the housekeeping stuff put up blinds. The space is very small inside the washroom. There are small terraces either facing a landscaped garden or pool. Mr. Praveen from the restaurant was very very helpful and upbeat. The age old preserved Lift was an added attraction. All in all we had a very good time and chilled out big time.",positive
I'm not sure if I would award this hotel 5 stars. It is perhaps closer to 4 and a half or 4. It was a really pleasant stay and the staff were plentiful and helpful. I don't know if I would stay there again because it is expensive for what it is. I have stayed in similar places around Asia for much cheaper prices. The breakfast buffet was great. I enjoyed eating Sri Lankan breakfasts every morning. The help when booking tours was lacking. There wasn't much in the way of information and there was no price list. The hotel was only willing to book taxis for you and then you were on your own. I would recommend this hotel and the area to anybody but don't expect a high 5 star experience.,positive
"Delicious food dishes, Sri Lankan, Chinies, Lot of veraity with reasonable price.Staff waiter are very friendly.Atmosphere is good,both restaurant & baris near the pool.location of this hotel is excellent, ideal for the families .",positive
"This was the fourth and last hotel we stayed at during our journey through Sri Lanka, and although the first three had been amazing, too, we loved this one the most. The location is perfect. The facilities are really nice. We're a family of 4 (2 adults with 2 children aged 7 and 8) and spent 5 nights in a family room. The room was spacious despite the extra bed, and the view from our room was stunning. Such a treat to wake up looking at the ocean, after a hectic journey through the country. We loved the pool and the recreational area with sun beds around it. The staff was exceptionally friendly and well-trained. Breakfast and dinner buffets were splendid. So much good food, way too much for only one stomach ;-). We honestly loved every single items on both buffets, every day! The only trouble we faced was a smelly room. The room adjacent to ours was under refurbishment, and a strong smell of chemicals reached our room through the A/C. The issue was handled very professionally by the Duty Manager who offered us another room and complimentary free dinner. We were kept happy! The hotel features a play room with snooker and mini foot, carom, etc. The outside space is vast. always enough sun beds and smiles for every guests. A special shout out to Mahi, our favorite pool attendant, who made our stay so much more enjoyable :). The Heritance Ahungalla is worth a stay and comes highly recommended!",positive
"We stayed here for 2 nights with high expectation, but were a bit disappointed about the in room facility. The room is a bit old, the electric water pot was quite dirty. The tooth mug was dirty with crack, the shower gel container also had crack and without a cap. I don't expect all these for a 5 star hotel! Speaking of service particularly the restaurant serving the buffet. It takes me several attempt to refill the coffee and got the plates collected. The waitress saw us and not responding. However, they are responding proactively to non Chinese. This gave me a sense of discrimination! Despite the negatives, the swimming pool is fantastic. It faces the Indian Ocean which is awesome!",neutral
"Very good place to spend you're holiday lot of entreatments. Good swimming pool . Beach swim , playing facility . Good service. Lot of food varieties . Relaxing , fun traditional Dancing shows. And we spent with tour guide Chinthaka . Baja Bike tours . He gave lot of facilities by located at Heritance Ahungalla",positive
"My wife and I got married at Heritance Ahungalla last month and the hotel more than met our expectation that it would be the perfect venue for the wedding. As a lot of these reviews have said, the location is stunning - and its natural beauty was perfectly complemented by the functionality of the hotel, as well the sincerity and attentiveness of the staff. We needed somewhere to host our big day and house the 130+ guests that were attending, and the scale of the hotel made it an obvious choice. But I'd just as happily spend time there with just my wife or a small group of friends. It caters for everyone because there's no end of things to do...or not do, as the case may be. We divided our time around the wedding day either relaxing by/in the two huge pools, working up a sweat on the beach volleyball courts or eating/drinking our way through the extensive food and beverage menus. And I honestly can't think of a better way to spend a holiday of this kind. One of the reasons we chose Heritance Ahungalla, over the countless other resorts on the south west coast of Sri Lanka, was the more local feel and authenticity to the service. As odd as it may sound, we didn't want guests to experience the sterile atmosphere that you sometimes encounter when you go to large international chains, where staff are all reading the same global manual on customer service. We were, after all, asking our friends to travel a large distance, so it was important to us that they experienced truly local hospitality, and that they did. The staff were extremely kind and friendly and bent over backwards for us, while their professionalism on the day of the wedding was consummate and went a long way to making it the success that it was. The food, both on the wedding day and generally, was fantastic. We'd paid for B&B and were delighted with the vast buffet laid on each morning at breakfast, offering both Western and local options; from cereal, pastries, fruit or a full English to the more traditional curry and hoppers. We ate an unbelievably fresh seafood lunch (which I highly recommend) at the aptly titled 'Jungle Beach Restaurant' just 300m walk up the beach from the hotel, but otherwise had lunch/dinner at any one of the hotel restaurants or bars. I'm not normally a fan of such a repetitive approach but the hotel food was simply too good to resist. On the wedding day we had the hotel serve up a Sri Lankan buffet, which proved a massive hit with the guests. Special thanks have to go to Gamini (F&B Manager) and KK for their help with organising the wedding and co-ordinating the countless moving parts on the day, Upul (GM) for his hospitality and joviality (he spent a large amount of time talking to guests and making sure they had everything they needed) and the front-of-house staff, who did an admirable job helping to unravel a bit of a screw-up with lost bookings that seemed to originate at the Colombo head office that we'd been dealing with up until that point. Guys, it was a day that will live long in our memories and we will forever be grateful for the role that you played in it. We visited countless other hotels over the course of the rest of our trip and there wasn't one that we thought would have been a better wedding venue. Thank you for making our dream wedding come true and we look forward to paying you a visit again soon.",positive
"As you enter, the view of the beautiful pool .... merging into a pristine beach ... merging into the sea sweeps you away. Unfortunately you don't get swept off your feet at this property. Since we didn't get a booking at the VIVANTA by Taj in Bentota we thought we'd try the Heritance. The property is run down and seems to have seen better days. A renovation should be on the cards sooner than later. We were upgraded to a suite named after the legendary Sachin Tendulkar but unfortunately the exhilaration of of the room or the hotel in no way matched the Little Master's batting. The room was ill-planned. No light switches and plug points in the right places, basins in which you couldn't splash your face, a Mini Bar fridge with a broken shelf, and never replenished, pathetic mal-functioning wifi...... and one could go on and on.... Minor glitches but collectively a huge nuisance for the price we paid. The biggest problem was the air-conditioning, never below 24 degrees Celsius. This in a hot and humid Bentota was a big problem. Two large swimming pools. Wow !! one for playing and kids and one for peaceful and serious swimmers like me. A Great idea! However the pleasure was short lived when we entered the pool. The water was cloudy and had particles flowing in it. Temperature was like soup. The Gym was exceedingly ill-equipped for the number of rooms. Only two treadmills, one of which was closed non-functional for the duration of my stay. One large dining area for buffets. One fine-dining restaurant but we never saw a living sole there in the 4 nights we spent. The food at the buffets were exceptional, but in case you're a vegetarian please be very careful. Options are very limited. Since large groups were coming in the buffet tables had huge queues. I for one am fond of nibbling tit bits going often to the table. But that was a Big no-no. Dealing with the lower staff is impossible. Not only is their a pathetic standard of English, many of them pretend to understand and say yes but things are not done. However I'd be failing in my duty if I didn't mention here, that the senior staff ably led by GM Mr Upul Peiris and the F&B Manager Gamini, were extremely courteous and helpful. Highly responsive. Problems brought to their notice were promptly attended to. I believe Mr Peiris has been here only for a few months. Seeing his leadership abilities and genuine concern for the customer I'm very sure these glitches should be a thing of the past very soon. The management needs to move from Responsiveness to Pro-activeness. My recommendation is to go here at a quiet time and not during peak season.",negative
Pool & see in same level looking from Entrance and exiting beach area and very beautiful and well organized archaeological building and feel better in side the hotel. Very easy to reach from Colombo via Golle Road and better reception for welcome and food also better and delicious.,positive
Good welcoming. Food was good. Need to improve the service. Beach was clean and nice. Room was too small for what we paid I think. But it is a nice place to stay and that was my second time there after attending a office conference. But as a hotel they need to have had other varieties of alcohol and tea rather than promoting the mother companies or its owner's products.,positive
"Wow what an amazing place. My son Ravin and his beautiful fiancée Liz got married at the Heritance 3 weeks ago. It was the perfect location for their wedding. They wanted a beach wedding and it was magical on the day. 95% of the guests travelled from overseas and also made it s holiday. The wedding was organized by the couple remotely from Australia with a bit of help from me and we pass on our heartfelt thanks to Gamini, the F&B manager and his team who worked tirelessly with us to make the day perfect for the bride and groom. KK who was a big part of the initial organizing team was unfortunately not around on the day as he left to work overseas Thanks KK! The food and drink was excellent matched by the great service which was enjoyed by all. Majority of the wedding guests stayed over in excess of 4 days and everyone enjoyed themselves. We ate together in large groups and there was fun and laughter all around. We could not fault the service. The staff were always smiling and so happy to help. The General Manager Mr Upul Pieris was often around chatting with the guests to make sure all was well. The front office team did a great job when some of the bookings had been messed up by their Head office and they were overbooked. Chathuranga who was there that night somehow sorted the mess and found rooms for these guests who were arriving late at night from Australia. So it's a big THANK YOU to the General Manager and staff of the Heritance Ahungalle for a wonderful job done. We heard only praise from all the wedding guests who stayed there. We highly recommend this beautiful hotel.",positive
"This hotel is just the place for you to relax , with 2 pools and the nearby sea , big and clean rooms , we ended our tour in Sri Lanka at this hotel , it had nothing magical as other places but certainly it is a place to rest and swim after a long journey 😃",positive
"Clean and nice beach, we recommend to families who is looking for silence and peaceful place to stay, good food and kind people. Rooms are getting old need a bit renovation and the drinks in minibar a bit rip off",positive
This hotel lives up to its claims. Beautiful location on a stunning beach. Currently not overly developed so you'll feel like it's yours with only a handful of other beach dwellers Lovely restaurant choices and two fantastic swimming pools in the park like grounds. Lovely stay with a great room and awesome service. Well worth it. The beach hawkers are a bit intrusive but that was the only negative.,positive
"We had an Enjoyable and relaxed weekend.. excellent stuff coupled with good food and a clean, comfortable room! The stuff went out of their way to ensure that even our 5 year old son had a great time!",positive
"We stayed 4 nights at the hotel and had a nice room in front of the second/small swimming pool. The hotel has many facilities, different restaurants and a magnificent beach a minute from our room (literally). The breakfast was very good, many options available from fresh fruits to local, international or even indian cuisine. The staff is very friendly and accommodating and although breakfast ends at 10 am they will still let people have breakfast if they arrive late. The outside restaurant have a good variety of finger food, main dishes and deserts as well as different drinks. Our room was a bit smelly probably because of the humidity but i do not think the hotel could do much about it, our overall experience was very relaxing and we will be back for sure! Tips : if you walk north the hotel on the beach you will find a couple of nice restaurant where local fishermen sell fresh fish. The food is delicious !!",positive
"This is our third visit to the Heritance, our first being 33 years ago, when it was called the TRITON hotel. It is pleasing to see the approach, frontage to the hotel has not changed during all this time, despite being badly damaged by the Tsunami that hit Sri Lanka. The open air lobby, reception area still has all its colonial charm looking out to the sea beyond the large pool that extends into the lobby. We were fortunate to meet the recently arrived Executive General manager Mr Upul Peiris who as it happens was at the hotel as a junior manager 33 years ago. It was amusing going down ""memory lane"" and he was interested in our views of the hotel over the years. Mr Peiris and his management team were very keen on ensuring the hotel staff were committed to giving customer satisfaction and service. This was very apparent during our stay, an excellent service given by all staff. A special mention to SUDESH, pool bar waiter who looked after us so well.. Good selection of food ( Buffet style) in main restaurant with a very good a la carte and Fine Dining restaurants. As it happens we were at the Heritance over the Chinese New Year and had an influx of people from this country. They were noisy but kept to themselves although were quite rude and lacked manners when talking to the staff. In fairness this could have been due to the language problem. Have been advised the hotel bedrooms are due to be refurbished, the bathrooms are looking dated and need to be upgraded, however, rooms were kept clean and to a high standard. Would highly recommend the Heritance Hotel as a holiday destination. Had a great time and only regret is that we did not book a longer stay than the 10 days we were there. Will definitely be returning.",positive
"We had a very relaxing and enjoyable vacation after spending 4 nights at this 5 star hotel in Ahungalle. We stayed in a luxury room and the rest of our group in 4 other luxury rooms which were all fabulous in their own unique way. All rooms were extremely spacious and we were upgraded to a suite which had a huge living room along with a separate master bedroom equipped with flat screen, DVD player and sound system, a huge bathroom with shower stall, elevated jaccuzzi tub, separate his/hers sinks and a huge wrap around patio with deck chairs. I'll post some pictures to illustrate but please note these were taken just before we left so naturally the room was a bit messy. The hotel has all the amenities for fun with 2 outdoor pools, tennis courts, badminton court and table tennis. The main outdoor pool by the lobby overlooks the ocean and is very picturesque. We particularly enjoyed the other pool which had the shade of a large tree and hence it was never too sunny for a swim. The food was good with seafood at every meal and breakfast was by far the best meal as well as one night with a Sri Lankan fare dinner. Jananjaya a waiter from the main restaurant went out of his way to please and provided the best service I've ever experienced in a buffet setting. Kaushal one of the housekeepers was also very attentive and made lovely animals for our son from towels. Even David P a trainee at the hotel went above and beyond to ensure we had a great stay. Overall from the time we arrived the service was impeccable and probably largely attributed to the very unassuming and nice general manager Upul Peiris who appears to be leading from the front and has clearly set a high bar for the service culture, he mentioned he had previously managed several resorts in the Maldives. The only downside to this hotel is it was designed by a famous Sri Lankan architect who believes in blending in with nature and hence it is not safe for young kids to wonder around alone since the stairways do not have rails, there are ponds all over etc. There is also no separate kids swimming pool. The beach by the hotel is very nice, however, the ocean maybe a little too rough if waves and body surfing are not your thing.",positive
"The food is good, the hotel is old but nice. The pools are beautiful. The beach is clean but the waves are to high for swimming. The only but very anoying problem was they started renovating the rooms and stairs next to us and wrote our travel agency there won't be any renovation when we asked. That's not possible in a 5 star hotel.",neutral
"I have stayed here several times and each time have been very content. The hotel is a beach front property with 2 large pools. It's a large hotel which is creatively designed to provide lots of areas to lounge and chill, including a small library. I would recommend for family get aways as there is additionally a table tennis table and a badminton court to keep occupied. The food buffet have a wide range of choice but the taste can be improved.",positive
"This is a beautiful hotel located designed by Geoffrey Bawa, beach side with stunning views. It's about 15 km south of Bentota, on the way to Galle. Lot of the original features have been restored after the Tsunami disaster. One gets a tremendous sense of proportion and to appreciate this have to get up early and stand in the hotel lobby and look across to the pool and sea on one side and the palm trees on the other side. On the plus side you have excellent staff, good food and service, with a pretty quiet beach. There are local vendors who are polite and not pushy. The coffee shop/ restaurant has a great snack menu. Unlimited wifi works well throughout the hotel. On the downside the bedrooms need complete overhaul and refurbishment. Tip is to ask for a room with a shower. May be avoid ground floor room. Room 308 is a great suite but no shower! Hotel is a ideally located for visiting Galle, Mirissa( about 1 hour) and the Tsunami memorial.",positive
"Really great resort style hotel close to Colombo. We chose to stay an extra day on our trip just relaxing by the pool. You can also visit nearby turtle hatcheries and donate money as well as see the turtles. This hotel is huge and has several restaurants, a gym, two pools. Quite a bargain really.",positive
Checked into heritance ahungalla a week ago to start my long awaited vacation and had an excellent stay here. From prompt front office service staff to the GM Mr. Peiris made my stay a memorable one. Highlight of the trip would be the room upgrade as well as the breathtaking pools to relax. Look forward to coming to the resort for my next vacation. A big kudos to the entire staff.,positive
"They say first impressions are everything!! We knew we were in for a rough time as soon as we arrived. On arrival we were shown to a scruffy bar area with tatty leatherette seats which were all torn and ripped. For the third time in 6 days in Sri Lanka we were taken to a really horrid room (No. 228)!! OMG what a dump - we had paid for a king-size luxury room and what we got was a prison cell twin!! It was filthy, pokey, run down and utterly horrid. Needless to say we made a fuss and were initially told we would have to pay for an upgrade!! We were finally upgraded to a suite gratis. Unfortunately this was not much better!! The hotel is in a terrible state and is in dire need of major renovation. One of the biggest problems in this hotel is the design. This hotel is celebrated for it's design and architecture but in my opinion this is misplaced. All the bathroom walls are simply skimmed concrete which gives them a horrid dingy, dirty prison cell-like appearance. There were no curtains - just these filthy heavy shutters which moved in filthy tracks. The blinds were broken, filthy and flaking!! Pillows were stained. The remote control for the TV was held together with sticky tape, the hotel guide book was covered in sticky dried food, the chair at the desk was filthy and the mini-bar fridge was rusty and leaking water. The final straw was the insect life living in the room!! We were tired, upset and ready to leave. By this time it was very late at night and we contacted our travel agents in UK and told them we wanted to return to UK asap. We were told there was nothing that could be done until the morning. We spent a very uncomfortable night and waited to see what would happen. Well; we had obviously stirred the hornets nest!! Next morning we were contacted by the front of house manager and within minutes we were surrounded by loads of staff members apologising and promising to make things right. After a short while we were upgraded again to a genuinely luxury suite which was lovely. Clean linen, clean floors, curtains and the biggest jacuzzi I have ever seen!! Throughout the whole process all of the staff at the hotel were wonderful and helpful and charming!! We enjoyed the rest of our stay. Once this hotel has been renovated it will be fantastic, if you are looking for a stunning beach resort. The location is idyllic. The buffet restaurant is good with plenty of high quality options - western and local cuisine. Make the most of the area - hire the bikes that the hotel offer and enjoy the amazing countryside. - we spent a couple of hours cycling through the local village. What a treat!! Giant Monitor lizard by the side of the road, buffalo wandering towards us on the road, local farmers working in the paddy fields surrounded by cattle Egrets and monkeys jumping through the trees!! It was very hot but one of the highlights of our trip. A day trip to Galle was very worthwhile as were trips to the local towns. The local Turtle hatcheries are wonderful but beware the 'Spice Gardens' - rip-offs aimed squarely at parting unwary tourists from their cash!! I was genuinely shocked at the number of people putting their towels on the pool-side loungers before breakfast and then obviously spending the whole day baking and drinking beer. Bloody long way to go for skin cancer and to not experience all the amazing sights, people and wildlife this wonderful country has to offer!!",negative
"This hotel is set back from a beautiful beach view and it is difficult not to relax in the setting there. My room was stunning with a huge rooftop balcony area. It was cleaned twice a day and I was left with beautiful towel creations on my bed each day along with flowers laid out (I loved the elephant!). The staff were very polite and always willing to help me out. I was at the hotel for my friend's wedding and many of us enjoyed their great facilities such as the lovely spa where I had a very relaxing hot stone massage, swimming in their two large pools with spectacular views and an aqua aerobics class and their restaurant and coffee shop. The breakfast buffet was enormous - you could have a contintental breakfast, a cooked western style breakfast or Sri Lankan food such as hoppers and curry. All the food was tasty and they even had a good selection of wine on offer (which you don't get in many asian countries). The only downside is that there were a few mix-ups with the rooms - some people didn't have rooms ready on arrival and the check-out process was quite painful. If there was any discrepancy with the bill it took so long to review that everyone just ended up paying the stated amount to avoid missing their transport connections etc which wasn't great. With such a lot of people checking out at the same time, they needed more staff on point for this process and a faster way of dealing with any arising issues.",positive
After I spent one day without any super delicious culinary works. On the second day I have experienced great improvement. Then I have noticed an arrival of a new Chef Mr. KAVINDA. He was personally looked in to every detail of the dishes & how the people enjoy the dining experience. I was truly impressed! I've got the opportunity to visit their kitchen which was absolutely super clean. I was really fortunate to visit their culinary carvings which helped HERITANCE AHUNGALLA to win many CULINARY OLYMPICS accolades for the past years. The carvings were mesmerizing. The latest culinary champ Mr. JAGATHSIRI was really helpful in showing us around.,positive
"We had a lot of trouble securing a room here before we arrived but then mysteriously some rooms appeared the day we tried to relocate from a nearby hotel. Lucky break! The location and amenities really are fantastic and the breakfast is incredible!! Definitely allow for some time to laze by the pool and maybe join in the water aerobics. We were in a large group and had a ball! The room was upgraded and was absolutely beautiful - very comfy bed (deal breaker for me) and a welcome basket of fresh fruit was a nice surprise. The bathrooms are starting to look a little tired (water damage on room etc) but overall we had a brilliant time. Infact, it was tempting to spend every waking minute at the resort and not go out adventuring. If you need cash, get your taxi to stop on your way to hotel as there are no cash point machines nearby to the hotel. And ask about the secluded seafood hotel (about 300m up the beach) for a really special treat. Amazing!",positive
"Since I stayed in the hotel for almost a week with all inclusive package, I have had enough time to examine every part of it. ROOMS. It can be seen that the hotel is old. So are rooms. Even though staff cleans them regularly, you can't hide things like mold or very old and severely used furniture. Bathroom was clean, but not in the best shape either. Our neighbours had some creatures coming out from bathroom sink, but the issue was quickly solved by staff (so be careful and notify staff if you see anything weird). Rooms are not soundproof at all, so you hear all the noise from the hallway and from outside (especially, from a wedding or a ""private party""). FACILITIES. Pools and theirs surrounding facilities are fine. The only annoying thing are beachboys (some guys offering you tuk-tuk rides and women selling clothes). These people might follow you and annoy from day to day, but a firm ""no"" is ok for them to go away. Be aware that prices are higher than anywhere else. Also, be careful with the tuk-tuk guys. Negotiate the final price and all other aspects right away, so you won't get fooled in the end. They will tend to bring you to their ""friends"" (places, where prices are super high and tuk-tuk driver gets his cut), such as local ayurveda farm/massage, gemstone mine, souvenir shops, and some tea shops/ spa's. Beach is not populated - guests are swimming in the pool (which I found weird, because the ocean is so warm). Some (and again, SOME) of the public bathrooms around hotel stink like hell. They were clean, but that smell... I can still feel it. Also note, that the hotel is located in Ahungalla, which is not that famous for its tourist attractions. New hotels are being built, but it takes time until the whole tourist infrastructure will appear around this place. FOOD AND DRINKS: Breakfast, lunch, and dinner buffets are fine. The variety of food is also fine, however, if you stay more than 5 days you will get bored with the food (it is different, but usually tastes the same). One great thing: desserts are marvellous! The barman at the pool bar is quite experienced and nice. A la carte menu is somewhat average. Be aware, that ""service costs"" are usually will be between 25 and 50%, which I found ridiculous. STAFF Friendly, as mentioned before. Not all of them speak proper English, so if you have a question or a request - try to use simple words. During the buffet, drinks are poured by waiters. From the day one I realized that you have to say twice if you wanted to have a drink, otherwise they would forget it. Some of staff saw my all inclusive bracelet and asked if I could get a beer/cocktail for them from a bar. if you want to use their taxi service, I highly recommend a driver named Nishan. Competent young man, who does not try to fool you. Overall, good experience. CONCLUSION. There are some positive things, but you can't say this hotel has five stars just because of friendliness of staff. Rooms, some facilities, surroundings, and other minor things don't make it a 5*. So, for this price you can find (I believe) something much better. But I wish good luck to Heritance and hope it will change to the better.",positive
"An impressive building giving access to a beautiful beach just a few yards away. There is a very open feel to the place especially when you arrive at reception. Our room just about had a sea view, but was certainly well presented, clean and tidy. WIFI worked well everywhere. We stayed two nights and had the buffet once. Although we were feeling a bit anti buffet, after having one virtually every day of our tour, this turned out to be a good one, with fresh prawns in particular on tap. The other night we ate in the a la carte restaurant but the food there was only average. All the staff were friendly and helpful. We sunbathed one night near the beach. There are vendors who are a bit of a nuisance and I would suggest you have nothing to do with them. Their prices are more than you would expect to pay elsewhere. Unfortunately my wife did have an issue with one woman who tried to cheat her and it had to be resolved by the hotel beach staff. Be careful to avoid a room over the kitchens because of the fumes. One of our tour had this problem but was moved promptly by reception. Overall this was a good stay in an impressive hotel.",positive
"I went with my family to spend a day to this hotel on 21st of February 2016. The architecture of the hotel is fabulous. From the gate to the hotel, the famous Sri Lankan architect Geofrrey Bawa , who designed Sri Lanakn parliament, has showcased his best skills and the entrance looks so green with trees of different families. The staff were very friendly and helpful. From the time we checked-in, till we checked-out they offered the best service. The lunch buffet was not the best but it was ok. They had a good spread but the taste wasn't that great. Salads, soups and desserts on offer were awesome. The bar was facing the main swimming pool and it is well stocked with experienced bar man. The hotel also features a second pool which is strictly for residents. The long meadow with well grown trees attract variety of birds and squirrels. It gives a nice sight and all birds and squirrels are very friendly with the guests. The guests can perform sea bathing but it is at their own risk. The rooms and common restrooms are maintained well and those are kept clean all time. It was also visible that the hotel was fully booked yet the staff handled the day very well. The day ended with a great coffee and a piece of cake. I would strongly recommend everyone to pay a visit to this hotel and get your self treated like an emperor. Key attraction: the beautiful architecture and landscaping",positive
"hotel and the view is very beautiful,bathrooms need to be refurbish,restaurant staff is very friendly with good service skills,most disgusting thing is a girl come to every table @ the restaurant and begging for good reviews on trip advisor so don't judge on those reviews ,please stop doing that.food is old fashioned ,cant expect these quality of food from a five star hotel.the good lesson i learned from this hotel is not to book any hotel by looking at the reviews.you guys put a bad image on the heritance name.",negative
"This hotel is a 5* for: size and quality of the rooms, facilities (big pools, big public areas to stay,...), cuisine (breakfast, lunch and dinner) and the well located at the beach with gold sand and brave ocean. We liked the hotel even we had 3 terrible weather days (raining dogs and cats)",positive
"We spent a couple of nights here after a tour of SL. From the moment you step off the bus and look through the hotel across the pool to the golden sand and sea you appreciate the great design of the hotel. It sits so comfortably in its palm gardens right by the beach that despite being a large hotel it feels calm and relaxed. BUT I did not feel that the detail lived up to the 5* billing. I get the minimal architecture - whitewashed walls, exposed concrete - but for it to work all the details need to be perfect. I could go through a list but one thing illustrates it perfectly. Sleeping in after a tiring trip, I decided to make a cup of tea without disturbing my wife. I found the kettle in its little cupboard. Square pin plug. Lots of plugs in the room but all of them round, except the one for the telly. Unplug the telly. Cable on kettle not long enough to reach the floor. Have to move the telly so I can perch the kettle next to it. Even a €50 B&B can get these things right! Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed our stay there. My rating is against where this hotel should be!",positive
Wonderful location with a lovely beach... food is awosome.... staff is very friendly and helpful.... swimming pools are amazing.. specially the green pool... but only thing is lights to be improved in the room..,positive
"We stayed for 10 in the luxury room during February. The room itself was large and clean, however the accommodation in general needs to up its game to 5 star standards. We were shown two of the newly refitted rooms which were beautiful, however planned works due to start in May have been delayed. What a shame! Other areas of the hotel are showing signs of wear and tear for example the gym with its old equipment. Now to the positives of which there were many. The layout of the hotel is stunning with two massive pools at either end of the hotel. The staff at the hotel are outstanding with particular reference to the pool boys and resaurant staff. Nothing was ever a problem and each request was greeted with a smile . I would advise to eat at the hotel as there aren't that many options outside. Although buffet fare there was always lots of variety, and we were pleased We had a couple of issues , however these were sorted out by the general manager. If you are not happy speak with him and the issue will be resolved. We had a super relaxing break and felt totally looked after with that personal service The hotel will be 5 plus after the refurbishment. We visit again",negative
the staff was perfect and the food is very goog and they are so friendly and the location also very good and the beach is very clean and perfect actually i like the staff very much specially shanikka is so candlly and friendly,positive
"I planned a day out two weeks ago and requested details from the Hotel. I got the confirmation on 10 Feb with the reservation number. Representative from the hotel called me and confirmed my booking also. When We went to the hotel, the front office said they could not give us a room since hotel is fully occupied and they give the rooms for the day use on availability basis(not informed at the time of booking). However, they agreed to give us a changing room (B Grade room as per the front office) on FOC basis and we said ok since we traveled 2 hours from Colombo to Ahungalla. However, we didn't get the changing room also which was agreed to give within 10 minutes. We were there for about 1 hour and we cancelled our day out and came back to Colombo. At that time the front office staff asked the confirmation number and he said the booking was in the system. :( I don't about the process of Heritance Ahungalla, but this was my experience with this Hotel.",negative
"Hard to fault this place as its defiantly got some class and style. Coming from Western Australia we did find the beach a bit disappointing and bizarrely very unused , most likely due to the hassle that the tourists get from the local hawkers. We got a suite upgrade for one of our rooms which was very nice and the other room was great too. Buffet breakfast was pretty good but had a very disappointing ala carte dining experience including a nearly 90 min wait for main course, which was pretty average. Pools were nice . The hotel really needs refurbishment which I believe is happening later in the year . There is also a monster new hotel being built right next door. Staff were lovely. All in all , a really good hotel just needing a facelift",neutral
"Great property , superb location, EXCELLENT HOSPITALITY! The property is situated right on the beach with 2 amazing pools !A special mention to Mr Pravin and Mr Gamini for taking special care in regards to food since we were vegetarians ! Overall a wonderful and comfortable stay for 3 nights !",positive
"We stayed here four four nights after a long and tiring tour of Sri Lanka and found it was a perfect place to relax and unwind after all the travel. It is a beautifully designed hotel with a gorgeous pool overlooking the long sandy beach. There are plenty of sunbeams and helpful pool boys who will place your beds in sun or shade as required. Plenty of shade in the hot midday sun offered by the palm trees and shrubs, and great fun to sit and watch the tiny squirrels playing round the trees and sunbeds. Staff are polite and helpful and the food is good. The rooms are probably a little dated but spacious and we certainly enjoyed fabulous views over the beach and sea. The beach is lon and sandy and great for long walks, many played and swam in the sea but I thought it seemed a little rough when we said there. I have read many moments complaining about the men and women who hang about the entrance to the beach trying to sell you saris , trips or whatever, they are persistent it is true, but usually accepting of a firm 'No' and being waved away. I had another advantage by speaking nothing but Welsh to them if they were too persistent and that utterly confused them. Their presence took nothing away from our stay and we would be happy to stay at the Heritance again.",positive
"I want to start by saying we had a gorgeously relaxing break here. Overall our experience was very positive. Despite being classed as 4 star the building looks tired and in desperate need of renovation. The promised deluxe ocean view room faced one of the pools and garden, which was pleasant enough but not the sea view that was expected. The bedroom itself was very spacious and accommodated 2 extra beds for the children without losing the sense of space. The children thought that their beds were very uncomfortable but the main bed was comfortable. As with all areas of the hotel the bedroom was sparsely furnished and decorated. The swimming pools (2) were both large and very clean and the beach was fantastic. The food in the hotel was good quality and tasty. They are no children's menus but enough choice to satisfy my fussy daughter! The staff are all polite and helpful. The other hotel guests consisted mainly of older (retired) couples and larger groups of Chinese people. There were only one or two other families there which made us very self conscious of any noise we made in the swimming pool. Next door there is a very large 5 star resort under construction (due to open later this year). I would recommend the Heritance to people travelling through the area wishing to stay 2 or 3 nights, there are some interesting day trips in the area and it's a lovely place to relax and unwind.",positive
"We stayed two nights with our supplier who came from China & they enjoyed their stay with full of fun...the staff were very kind & supportive in all the ways,the pool was awesome,A must visit place!!!",positive
"Generally I found the experience here more professional than in our other hotels in Sri Lanka. I had no negative experience at all. One small point - it would make sense to be able to print out one's boarding pass for the flight home - can I be the first person staying at this hotel to try to do this? There is a computer for guests, but why not link it to a printer? Other hotels I have been in do this. The hotel is on a gorgeous beach, with a lovely pool and all the loungers you need. The food is excellent, slightly more expensive than other hotels we stayed at, and there are fish restaurants along the beach. I'm not sure there is much to do in the immediate vicinity, but for two or three days of relaxation at the end of a trip, it is just right.",positive
"impressive driveway leading to the reception area and infinity pool looking straight out to the beach and sea. The hotel is a little tired and needs updating but was spotlessly clean everywhere. Special mention of our room boy Rashan, who was always very happy and greeted everyone with his huge smile. Our room was always spotless and nothing was too much trouble. Buffet style meals were good and the food was always being attended to and constantly being refilled by the numerous chefs. Vast majority of the staff were extremely helpful and friendly, there is always the odd one who is a bit sullen but they are a small minority. hotel is situated on a bay, and there were never more than 2 dozen people at any one time on the beach, excluding the traders. don't know why because the beach was lovely for walking, although the sea was quite rough with bad undercurrents so wouldnt recommend swimming. The beach traders were a bit of a nuisance, being allowed to offer their goods and taxi services on the edge of the hotel grounds. you had to walk through them to get to the beach, and majority were particularly persistent. We even became involved in an extremely loud and animated argument between two taxi traders on the beach, one accusing the other of stealing his business because he had spoken to us!! we had made no promises to either trader and just walked off leaving them to continue their shouting! we did receive an apology from one of them later but we said we did not want to get involved with any arguments from anyone. Appreciate that the traders need business but this is not the right way to achieve it. Plus by the end of the holiday we realised that the beach traders including the women selling beach clothes etc. were very expensive compared to shops and taxis outside the hotel. My advice would be to use the taxis, tuktuks, local shops outside the hotel.",positive
"We used this hotel for a four night stay after touring Sri Lanka and this provided an excellent place to recharge our batteries. The hotel looks great and is well designed. Perhaps a little tired but we could see that the rooms were being upgraded. As they are they are comfortable although in need of a bit of updating. The pool area is good with helpful Pool Boys ensuring you had a sunbed, towels etc. The pool bar is good offering good snacks which were delicious served by helpful staff. Overall service was very good. Food across a number of outlets is good with the coffee shop the best place to go with good good at a decent price. We did have one nightmare evening at the fine dining restaurant where service a food was well below standard. Our complaint was dealt with well. There is a good beach in front of the hotel albeit this is not owned by the hotel do there are no sunbeds. WiFi is available throughout.",positive
We were blown away by the service we received by the hotel staff. We were absolutely spoiled by them and didn't want to leave this place. We were there for 5 days with my family and it was an experience to remember. We were upgraded to a very spacious room and at the hotel restaurant staff went out of the way to make sure we got what we needed. Any kind of Sri Lankan food we wanted to try they made it available for us. This is the 2nd time I have been at this hotel and definitely will be going back again.,positive
"I have been to Sri Lanka last winter. I stayed in 5 star hotel Heritance in Ahungalla. I lived in big room with amazing ocean view. First day we spent on the beach, on the great beach! Second day we rented tuk-tuk, and went to shop to buy something, and visit turtle farm. And there, we bought rum! In Sri Lanka very good rum, i advice to drink Sri Lanka's rum. A few days late we went to river safari. Then we went to Safa Park. It's beautiful place with many different animals like elephants, monkeys, alligators, deers and so on. And I advice to visit city Galle, it's amazing city with great people. We went there in last day, and didn't have much time, that's why I want to visit Galle again. In Sri Lanka very beautiful nature. When we went to Sri Lanka, we thought Sri Lanka dirty country like India, but it's not true. It's clean. If you want to go to paradise, you must go to Sri Lanka. I fell in love with Sri Lanka.",positive
"As we pulled up outside the entrance to this hotel we were amazed at the view. We were looking forward to some relaxing days. We were shown to our room which was disappointing. It had a poor view and the shower was in need of some good quality cleaning products, with the grouting all black and the glass door was covered in limescale. We were so unhappy and disappointed (this was the third hotel in the group that we've stayed at on this trip) that we asked to be moved to a different room. This was facilitated but we had to wait almost two hours for the replacement room to be ready. This room had a much better outlook and whilst the grouting was cleaner, there was still the same issue with the shower door. Some good limescale remover used regularly would work wonders. That said, the overall cleanliness of the room was very good. The room cleaning service was always good and the guys couldn't have been more helpful. The pool and gardens are nice and the staff at the pool were very good. On one occasion a man was in difficulty in the pool having wandered out of his depth, and the lifeguard on duty leaped to his aid. A happy ending. Don't be too worried if you see chipmunks and land monitors passing by. Perhaps even the occasional monkey. We found the service at the pool bar to be friendly but quite slow, with some staff, on occasion, preferring to stand and chat together. We ate in the outdoor restaurant twice and found the food to be pretty awful. After those poor experiences we ate in the buffet restaurant. I wish I could be more positive but I can only be honest - the evening meals were not up to the level of that at the previous hotel at which we'd stayed. We found many dishes overcooked and almost cold. At the dessert bar, only half the items were labelled, and if you went to eat after the main rush it felt like we were being given the leftovers. The whole presentation was lacklustre. The staff though, were very nice and friendly and the service good, though some worked harder than others. I feel this establishment would benefit greatly from more staff training and motivation.",negative
It was my second visit to this hotel with family and it was great!!! AGAIN!!! The staff is well trained and you can just FEEL the sincerity in their hospitality. Its no surprise that the team won the culinary awards because the food it just AWESOME...We enjoyed our stay and the kids had good fun. Cheers to the team..,positive
the staff went that extra mile to make the vacation extra special to the kids and their effort should be well mentioned. the food and beach were nice. the property needs refurbishment and i learnt it'll be done by May 2016.,positive
"Spending out holidays at heritance ahungalla was one of the best decisions ever. The ""Captain"" of the fantastic kitchen crew Mr. Manjula gave us a very warm welcome and invited us to his kitchen. After dinner we were allowed to see the impressive cooking areas and also the chocolate production. After that we were taught to cook a real Srilankan chicken curry- wow!!!! Two days later we enjoyed an outstanding birthday dinner at the beach with very nice seafood and excellent service. Thank you so much Mr. Manjula - we enjoyed our time with you so much and will definetely return :-). Room, location, pools&garden, room service etc. highly appreciated as well.",positive
We stayed at this place for a business conference (02 days) and everything was fine from the hotel side. This hotel is another beautiful Geoffrey Bawa design blended with nature and exterior/interior spaces.,positive
I'm proud to say that I went again to the heritance ahungalle. Now its like my home. Their warm welcome always surprises us with three different drinks. Front desk is awesome.always help us to get the better view rooms.Geoffrey Bawa's architecture makes us relax. Thank you so much for giving us the best holiday!,positive
"Stayed for four nights in January with the family. Had a bit of initial hiccup about not getting the room on time when asked for it with many calls. We also were staying in a deluxe room and they kindly upgraded us. So, the rooms are aging. The upgraded room was not what I liked but I got it when the upgrade was conveyed to me. What I loved most was the reaction when I spoke to the GM. He came, heard me, took the feedback well. Takes a good gm. Once i spoke to him I felt the service lot personalized. Was superb and was well spoken to, taken care of. Especially when we stay four nights, we wanna feel home. The restaurants are fabulous. Buffet meal, fine dining and in my opinion a coffee shop with a to die for menu. A veg menu in the coffee shop is also superb. Cannot fault most of the food in the coffee shop. This hotel has a lot of crowd which comes in tourist busses and stay for a night or two. Somehow it irritates me. But then, no harm to us. The lobby area pool is open to day visitors also and the other pool only for residents. If the plan is to sun bathe, swim, eat, drink and repeat then ask for room on ground floor by the pool. The landscape of the property and the pool ate V well maintained and attended to well. Again, I had a tough time with the pool attendantz but then I'll forget that part. The beach which the hotel overlooks is beautiful to sit and spend the evening. The nights are quiet and nice, the food is well. I'll come back once the property is done up. But importantly for me, I would want a nice personalized service especially if staying beyond two nights. The GM has impressed again and he made sure things were sorted. Thats a sign to come back here. Start your breakfast early and before the tourist bus crowd with their long table reservations get to the breakfast area. Gt noisy. The pools are superb and come to this property and do swim. It feels good. Don't wrote off the coffee shop. The food is fabulous and try the veg food. You will like it.",positive
"The services was excellent, room was spacious, total privacy with a gorgeous view of the sea . food was good had a good variety of food. and Excellent services from the staff. We Will be back soon and I would highly recommend here if you want to have a break away from a busy life. :)",positive
One my favorite beach side hotels in sri lanka. Visited this lovely hotel last week and that was my 4th visit this heavenly place and I would recommend Heritance Ahungalla to anybody who love the beach side hotels. One of the best food you can ever taste!! They have a very good verity of food for you to taste. There is a magnificent view of the beach and enough walking space and kids get enough space to play on the beach. Both the pools in the hotel are lovely but the resident pool is much more relaxing and less crowded. The staff at Heritance was very friendly.,positive
"We booked to stay at Heritance Ahungalla for 2 weeks to celebrate our honeymoon, and overall it was an incredibly enjoyable and relaxing couple of weeks. If you are looking for a stress free and laid back holiday then it is ideal. The beachside location is amazing and the hotel in itself feels private and secluded. Situated directly on the beach, separated only by the large infinity pool, the transition between beach and pool is incredibly easy. What really made the holiday was the amazing staff and brilliant food. From the waiters and pool attendants, through to the chefs and reception staff, you do feel they really want you to have an amazing time and go out of their way to provide what you want. Some of the best services were cocktails delivered to your loungers, and having tuna and prawns cooked fresh for you at meal times, and the lovely floral displays left on your bed after it has been cleaned. The buffet in itself offered good variety, and we stuck to the local Sri Lankan curries and local meal options every day and did not get bored of it at all. A personal favourite were the breakfast hoppers, and it was a great experience to go into the kitchen with Chef Menjula and have a cooking class on how to make them. They even gave us the recipes. There were so many members of staff that got to know us and spoke to on a daily basis and we are not able to remember and list all of them, but special mentions need to go to Chef Menjula and Chef Sanjay for the incredibly tasty tuna and prawns cooked to order, waiters Dharshana, Nelka, Sanjay and Thursita. Rohana, Kalinga, Sudesh and the many bar staff, whose names were given, but forgotten after a steady supply of local Lion beer and Gin Fizz. And of course the lovely Giayathri was always incredibly happy and smiley everytime we spoke with her, and was a fountain of knowledge on the hotel and its history. There was also an abundance of wildlife around the hotel grounds which for us was brilliant. A family of monkeys often visited various trees and roofs around the hotel, and were more than happy to come and grab a banana from you. Numerous birds, chipmunks and lizards also wondered around as you sunbathed and swam in the pools. Anyone looking to stay here, we would strongly advise the all inclusive option. We initially booked just accommodation and breakfast, thinking we would be able to leave the hotel when we wanted to eat in local restaurants etc. The village of Ahungalla is pretty remote, and without many of these facilities for tourists to try. We ended upgrading to all inclusive to really get your monies worth, as paying for things as you go ended up being really expensive. The clientele of the hotel were slightly older than we may have preferred to have been with, and this was reflected in the evening music, which for our tastes, tended to be a bit on the slow side. The exception in this being the local live music they had on occasion. Another slight negative would be some areas of the hotel looked slightly tired. Whilst the pools and rooms were lovely, some parts looked like they needed a bit of attention. Saying this, over the last couple of days they had started to renovate he hotel, and a full renovation was due to get underway once the hotel closes for the season in April. It is for these reasons only we couldn't give it a 5, and would have liked to rate it 4.5. The staff and food were definitely worthy of a 5! It will be interesting to see what it looks like when it reopens next season!",positive
"We stayed for a week and enjoyed our time. Impressing view from the moment one enters the resort. Friendly and attentive staff. They did their best to make us feel comfortable. We got an upgrade to a corner-suite on the 2nd floor - very spacious, nice view. We could experience a wedding ceremony from ""the balcony"". A minor construction error in the bathroom caused some flooding while one took a shower, but we could adapt. And although the housekeeping staff was really creative and sweet with daily new arrangement of flowers on our bed, it caused also the presence of tiny ants, which we had to get rid of back home. The food was excellent - a good variety of native and western dishes - and amazing desserts! We were even invited to a guided tour through the kitchen by the sous-chef, and we could see some of the high standard guidelines the staff are challenged to live up to. The grounds around the pools were well kept and one could relax without any disturbing noise. The great beach invites one into the sea - but I had to learn the hard way how important it is to take the red flag really seriously. The current can be really strong, but the hotels lifeguards did a great job pulling me out of the water. The hotel offers a massage parlor, where we got high quality treatment. Being new to Sri Lanka we wanted to go for a round trip after our stay, and asked the reception for advice and help with the arrangements. We were referred to a tourist agent sitting at a table around the corner - without pointing out that he was not attached to the hotel staff. Our trip was ok., but the hotels he suggested were not even close to the level of the Heritance Ahungalla, something we expressly asked for. All in all - we enjoyed our stay very much, thank you!",positive
Me and my wife came to Heritance Ahungalla to celebrate our first wedding anniversary in last week end. Hotel staff warmly welcome us and they prepared an anniversary cake for us. Food was delicious and hotel staff is very kindly. Hotel is very clean and beautiful. This is one of best 5 start hotel in Sri Lanka.,positive

"Stayed for 9 nights in January (wish it had been more). This is not a Caribbean 5* resort so don't compare as such. It is half the price and in a way better, in that it has a rustic charm and a really chilled out atmosphere. It is more than ok and we thought the food, location and the people were brilliant. The two pools are lovely the beach beautiful and the Spa excellent. Yes some of the complex could do with an upgrade but that is just being picky. Thank you to all who made our holiday special we would have no second thoughts about returning. A special mention to the chefs who gave us a tour of the kitchen and offered to cook me (as part of my all inclusive) a special dish and cooked me the best curry I have ever eaten in my life. That's how personal this place is.",neutral
"Room was satisfactory at best. Few charger portals also phone kept going off at random times. Toilet was in a dire state. For a '5 star hotel', the toilet cleanliness was spotty at best. Dinner Buffet was expensive which was why we expected better quality food as compared to the hotels we stayed in Sri Lanka. There was limited variety and food lacked freshness. For a 5 star hotel with 5 star prices, this was a very terrible stay",negative
Wonderfull view of beach.clean and besutiful beach.....exellent service and care.tasty foods with verities.... We will come back again and recommend to anyone.... Thank you for everything...........excellent resort....,positive
After seven years living overseas decided to visit back to Sri Lanka for holidays I had the opportunity to holiday in Ahungalle Heritance by Chance .At the moment I cheked in I felt that I stepped in to a heaven with great location covered one side with Ocean and front viewed nicely with eco friendly pool. When come to foods cannot be compared to any other places that I visited during my stay in Sri Lanka .Rooms are spacious and well clean.Out of all most facinated thing is friendly staff with quality service /very hospitable and polite. Never foget about Yare Tea that was served by the excellent staff. I highly recomended to tourist to make visit Ahugalle Heritance for your dream holiday. Finally thanking for the management and the dedicative team giving us wonderful service,positive

The hotel is great. The beach is the best thing there. Not to mention the food and the diversity of the buffet. The bathroom in the rooms is a bit exposed. The curtains they are using to cover the windows of the bathroom from the inside can show everything in the bathroom which totally elimates the privacy.,positive
"We got into this by accident and are very happy !!! the hotel is very nice, the prices in the restaurant are expensive. but very zorosho staff. -Swedish breakfast table, a lot of food, delicious! I have never had a stomachache. many pools. Many animals. I recommend this hotel.",positive

Great hotel. Booked a delux room and got and upgrade. Spacious room with great view.Friendly staff. Beautiful place with two superb pools. Nice buffet with huge variety of food items. Had a wonderful stay. Definitely a must visit again.,positive
"The hotel is Nice, and that sums it up really, rooms and surrounding areas are immaculate , situated on a magnificent beach, the only down side we found the food was very repetitive with very little variation, if I returned it would only be on a bed and breakfast.basis.. The staff are very nice, and smiley, although reception was rather impersonal .",positive
Hotel property is very beautiful and big property where you can relax... Good two night spend... Food was not that great... But the service is excellent.....staff is good......................thank you... We will come back..... Mira from India .....,positive
"When you arrive at this hotel you cannot help but be impressed. There is a large water feature outside reception and a lovely pool just inside. The rooms were pleasant but not great. When I got to the balcony the sea view was not quite what I imagined, the hotel is set a bit further back than it may appear in brochure photos. Found the staff very pleasant and the buffet choices quite expansive. The major disappointment were the cocktails on offer on the all inclusive. A couple off the Arrack based ones were OK but the others were pretty naff. Other AI's I have been to have a better range, although sometimes there is a small charge for the more expensive ones. Here it is full payment for non AI menu.",neutral
We really like food n services in hotel Nd specially for superb location on beach Having too much fun over here ...v r really very thankfull to all members of hotel .. I hope v come back again .........,positive
The hotel us really good and well organized.... staff us very polite and helpful... We really enjoyed the beach... staff looked after us very well.... good hospitality.... we will recommend..... and if have to come back sri kanka again i will definitely come back...,positive
"We stayed from 18 to 21 January with a group of 13 family members. This was the second hotel in the Heritance group we stayed at during our 23 day holiday in Sri Lanka. Compared to Heritance Kandalama Ahungalla was a real disappointment. It looks great when you first arrive - the pool looks fantastic but everything else about it was disappointing - the tiles in the foyer area and along the corridors are stained, the bathrooms need a really good scrub, the food in the buffets was boring and many of the staff looked like they just didn't want to be there. Overall there just didn't seem to be the attention to detail we saw at Kandalama - we booked 3 double rooms, 2 twins and one triple room. On arrival the 3 doubles were all made up as twins and the triple had only 2 beds. One of the couples called reception on arrival to have the beds remade as a a double and had no problems, the second called and was told that it was not their practice to do that and in order to have a double bed the couple would have to be moved and that couldn't happen at the time because the hotel was full, the third couple then rang and was upgraded to a better room, despite the previous couple being told that there were no other rooms at all. In the triple room a small fold out bed was provided and most of the first evening was spent trying to explain to the staff that the tiny bed was not large enough for a teenage boy. Eventually after much conversation a better bed was provided. My parents have visited this hotel 4 times, however I would not go there again. In its current condition it is not worth the price charged.",negative
"The property is little interior from Bentota town. A well maintaimed swimming pools overlooking the Indian Ocean. Fine sand beaches welcomes the guest from their rooms and the Sun sets in to the ocean looks so beautiful. Sipping a cup of hot coffee sitting in the room balconies gives you so much freshness & pleasant feeling in the mornings. Restaurant serves Asian and Continental food. Service is very good. Rooms are good in size decently furnished.Over all, we had a refreshing and relaxing time.",positive
"Had a most wonderful stay. Really friendly staff. Clean, spacious rooms, really good buffet with a wide array of local and international food. The infinity pool was fabulous. Unique architecture in the hotel is mind blowing. Totally recommand it",positive
"Dined at the Mustard Restaurant while we were staying at the Heritance Ahungalla. Staff were very friendly through out our stay and the service was exceptional.

The hotel met all our expectations, good clean rooms with a magnificent views from the balcony. Facilities were excellent, the swimming pools magnificent, the beach to die for. Overall an excellent hotel, we'll run by efficient staff with a ready smile. Well wor th the visit, well recommended !",positive

"We visited on 19th December we were a group of 7 adults and 3kids we received a warm welcome and it was a very busy day to fount office. All three meals were very good kids also enjoyed as well as us and rooms are also good and clean... we have booked 2 double rooms and a one triple room, But they don't have triple rooms they only give a extra bed for the third person... Wen they fixed the third bed it was a tragedy! none of us can sleep on that bed because it was a very small folding bed. I have never seen a extra bed like that in my life. we have visited many star class hotels, and we always booking a triple room as we are travelling with our mother. I have never seen such a small extra bed.... When we ask about this from the hotel they told us this is the size of a extra bed they provide. That bed is good for a kid not for a adult... I'm very very disappointed...But I couldn't let any one to sleep on that bed I barely manage that bed so didn't had a good sleep... It was a sleep less night. But except the bed all other things were at the hotel is good... We enjoyed the beach as well as the pools...",negative

Specially service was superb and Thushara and Praveen has give the excellent services. I enjoyed candle light dinner at Jute Restaurant. There wasn't Ice Cream. But the restaurant staff went off his way and bring the ice cream and give it to my child. Definitely I will be back.,positive
"We have been traveling around south India and Sri Lanka for almost 1 month. This hotel is not the worst of the lot, but it missed only by one place. In general it looks an feels very tired and you don't have to look very hard to find the dirt, grime, dust, and sand, and that was just in our room and bathroom. The same goes for many other public areas. With the exception of a few staff members we got the same impression. Tired of dealing with tourists... The food was only OK compared to everywhere else we stayed. It's a beautiful location, but unfortunately a disappointing experience compared to almost every other resort or hotel we have stayed at on this trip. Can't reccomend.",negative
"I've been patronizing this hotel for about 10 years and its a must place that you should be if you ever come to Sri Lanka. It has beautiful sea view, especially at sunset, lovely swimming pools and offers delicious food. The rooms are very comfortable and about the right size for a couple or a family. The food was superb as usual but perhaps lesser spread and variety than what it used to be 2-3 years ago. But the service is excellent as usual. You can request any type of food, even very traditional sri lankan food, the staff will bring you promptly. If you are travelling with children ,infants even, do not worry the staff is there to serve you. If you are looking for real Sri Lankan hospitality, this hotel should be there at the pinnacle of it! I really love this place and looking forward to visit every time I get an opportunity.",positive

"We travelled to this resort in Sri Lanka, located between Bentota and Galle, Our main reason for choosing this resort was our daughter was keen to visit Jeffrey Bawa designed properties and resorts, as she was a student of the subject. The Resort is a masterpiece, and also has it's own flaws! The meandering drive-in from the Highway into the Lobby will build up your excitement BUT the view on alighting from your long drive will take your breath away! The Lobby blends in with the pool and the pool with the beach and the beach with the Indian Ocean, all in a seemingly undivided attachment. Literally, there is no dividing wall or fence, There in lies the beauty! Besides, the resort has several facilities for the visiting travellers, including a games room, billiards table, 2 swimming pools, 3 restaurants, 1 bar, room service, etc. Nearby attractions include the Galle Fort, whale watching, a visit to the many turtle hatcheries in the area or Bawa's Estate - Lunuganga (now managed by his Trust). However, the very very pricey water, wine list and food, as well as the poor service in the restaurants are issues that need to be seriously addressed to by the management, besides the quality and variety of the food, including vegetarian fare.",positive

"We are in this hotel end of last december 2015. This hotel has aged quite a lot, even including the rooms. In our washroom water was not draining properly. Complained but nothing happened. Food was very mediocre...mostly Sri Lankan cuisine. Hotel check out was quite haphazard...You need to get into a room to checkout but not at the reception, looks like government organization. Staircase is not kids friendly. There were no safety railing in the staircase; kids can fall through the staircase. Requested the manager to give a feedback, but he was unavailable and he send the housekeeping manager (even though I explicitly requested the manager). They say resort is due for renovation, mid 2016. Well if it is due for renovation why charge premium rate...hmm not value for money.",negative

"The Heritance saved our holiday after we left our original hotel after one night (it was terrible!). The manager gave us a personal tour of the property before we committed to the room and made sure that we were 100% comfortable in the room. The hotel itself is wonderfully designed to have tons of light, airy walkways, and in general present a idyllic, peaceful atmosphere. The staff was extremely attentive, remembered our names, and very well trained. Only complaint was that booze wasn't included in the $250/pp mandatory New Years Eve dinner. Would absolutely come back here.",positive
"A good hotel but it has it's flaws, I didn't enjoy the food and the room is a bit too small. But on the good side it has a nice view! good service also. The staff are a good bunch. They're very nice. There are pools which are pretty big and good the sea was full of small waves I enjoyed it so much.",positive

"We were visiting from Chicago, USA, and spent a couple of days at the hotel with my brother's family. And Wow! What an amazing time it was. From the time we drove in to this breathtaking site we were treated like Royalty. We received a very warm welcome from the front office staff. The staff was always very pleasant and were always willing to cater to our needs with a smile. It was a Bonus to meet with the GM of the Hotel Mr. Refhan Razeen. It was beautiful to see the Top Guy of the facility always being around, meeting and greeting his guests, and offering his services. It was obvious that he was much loved and respected by his staff. Mr. Razeen has put together a great team who seem to love and take pride in their work. The hotel rooms were very clean & comfortable, with great views. The food was exemplary, with so many choices prepared tastefully. It was truly a Five Star Experience for us.We look forward to coming back again when we are visiting Colombo at the end of the year.",positive

"This is a lovely beach touching resort. The beach is a lovely almost private beach. It has a lovely large pool just touching the beach. The rooms are nice but feel slightly dated, some have great sea facing views. Food variety is the only downer - especially for vegetarians, not that many items in room service menu and similar in the restaurant. Breakfast has a good spread overall. The Spa is good but bit pricey for Srilanka standards. Service is decent although we had a slight issue with our billing. Overall a very nice property and worth staying!",positive
I came with my wife to this hotel for my honeymoon.. It was really amazed to be here.. I got a nice room with a very good view of the ocean.. My wife was so happy..

"My family stayed here for nearly a week over Christmas 2015. The hotel location was excellent, being right on a beautiful sandy beach which was fairly private (apart from the slightly irritating hawkers etc). We had 3 rooms together (for 5 of us) and we found the rooms to be well equipped, with a large comfortable bed and plenty of amenities. The window shutters were very effective at keeping the light out, so we all slept very well during our stay. The hotel wifi is free in all areas and worked reasonably well, though the system for issuing separate codes for each device was a bit fiddly, some devices dropping off (thus requiring a new code), while others worked fine. We were on half board, so this included breakfast and evening meal, both of which were served buffet style, with a changing selection of dishes, some international and some local. We found the variety was excellent - there was generally something for everyone each morning and night. We bought drinks most nights, and they had a reasonable selection of wines from various parts of the world, though they ran out of our favourite Chianti a couple of nights (no big deal). The entertainment at the poolside bar was generally very good, and they served a good variety of cocktails which we all enjoyed. We even ventured to the Night Club one night (Saturday), but were slightly surprised to find we were the first people there. We were eventually joined by a few others and had a good enough time, but not quite what we expected. The pool staff were particularly helpful and we had a few days of doing not very much sunbathing (or in my case hiding from the sun) by the pool. The pool itself was very good - possibly the warmest water I've swam in, and we even ventured into the sea one day where the water was also pleasantly warm, though the currents were slightly scary. Generally speaking the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. We were due to leave at midnight on New Year's Eve and were a bit unsure how that would work, but we managed to agree a compromise with the hotel manager, whereby we took part in most of the Gala Dinner and also kept one of our rooms until midnight. Overall I would say the holiday was very successful - we did a couple of trips out of the hotel - one to Galle, and the other to Udawalawe (to see the elephants), both of which were enjoyable, if a bit tiring.",positive
"Heritance always has good food, Ahungalla is easier to get to with the expressway around. The service is always good too! I'd highly recommend it. The beach is not the nicest but it's cleaner than some other beaches, it's easily worth the money!",positive
"Had a great time with our family at Heritance Ahungalla. Great location, great facilities and the staff genuinely make an effort to ensure great service. Spa facilities here are excellent too! The range of dishes at the buffet was good however the quality of food could be improved. We will certainly come back.",positive

Perfect rooms with very nice sea view. Rooms are spacious. ..specially i should mention about the beach. ..it ist very clean and beautiful. ..food is really nice. All the chefs are friendly... Staffl is very friendly and helpful. ...,positive
"The hotel is old but well maintained. Garden is wonderful and night lighting also. With regards to the food and beverage, the buffet is ok without any plus. The chefs are very helpful. Buffet conditions are poor, chafing dishes are broken, salad buffet is basic. The Sri Lankan corner is quiet repetitive. Breakfast was up to standard, except the scrambled eggs. Service during breakfast needs to be looked after, as we waited 10 minutes before we were asked for our beverages. Pool bar : Beverage choice ok, but service is not a 5 star and cocktails quality is not up to what expected. Check in was very long but friendly and professional. One major point that the management needs to tackle is the beach boys and all souvenir boys that literally bother you once you go on the beach. Over all good stay, but certainly not at 5 star level. The hotel is extremely overpriced.",neutral

"Heritance Ahungalle takes the meaning of customer service to a whole new & higher level. The welcoming, kind nature which filters down from GM. Mr. Refhan N. Razeen, through to his staff, which is certainly second to none, makes you feel at home right throughout your stay. The rooms are beautiful & clean whilst the very obliging housekeeping staff member, Kularathne ensured our rooms were of high standard. The F&B team led by Mr. Thushara Gnanarathna always went the extra mile to ensure our dining experience was unforgettable & I must add the buffet selection for every meal was unsurpassed & not to mention amazing! Heritance Ahungalle is highly recommended!",positive
When my family and I first came to the hotel I was very excited and happy because I saw how big and classy this hotel is. I was also excited to jump into the pool! I think that Heritance Ahungalla has a very good first impression and very good customer service. Even the little things the house keeping and room service do such as making nice little animal shapes with the towels and putting flowers on the bed simply make your day. It is very nice that they take an extra minute of their day just to do that for us. The food here is very nice with a great variety of things to eat. I found them very delicious to eat. Overal it was a amazing stay here at Heritance Ahungalla and I was very happy.,positive
"Heritance was our honeymoon destination few years ago. Therefore Heritance has a very special place in our life with unforgatable memories. Nice beach, delecious seafood, hospatility and amazing beauty of heritance forced us to visit it again. Hopefully we are going to visit heritance again in our next visit to Sri lanka.",positive
Very good hotel Excellent food and good worker. Amazing lopy at night Clean swemming pool Recommended. ....truly it was a perfect holiday...we will come back in 2017....thank you for all the staff.....,positive
We had a nuce time at this amazing resort.... staff is very friendly and helpful.....specially at the front desk.. food is really good at the coffee shop... beach is beautiful.... thank you for the wonderful holiday......,positive
"Had a trip to Ahungalla just for 4 days, nice and quite place to relax. Only the fitmess center was poor. Kularathne the men who was in charge in our section was very friendly and kind. Also the foos in the restaurant wered mostly fresh and the fruit bar was rich. I love passion fruit.",positive
"When we entered the room, we complained about the smell of mould - the hotel did nothing. We had paid for this hotel nine months previously and we were now trapped. At dinner that night - we were asked how our soup was - and we honestly advised there was too much salt (another freshly made batch was produced). Twenty-four hours later, I was screaming at a lady from Guest Relations, the Food and Beverage Manager and the Housekeeping Manager, all standing in our room, (yes at this stage they were willing to change rooms - why I cried, you did nothing 24 hrs ago when I complained.) So they said we were being upgraded to Fine Dining - oh really, we had already paid for an evening meal, So we went for a snack, then slept. (The night before there had been a graduation - that's where the blood came from - and our future leaders had a wonderful noisy night). Upon checkout I was asked if I would like to complete a feedback form - oh dear, you really want me to write about our experience and state that we had to pay for our food. To her credit, she ran and my husband was given back the money he had just paid - and I received two bottles of water. The photos speak for themselves. Five star accommodation - I don't think so.",negative
"Had wonderful time with family, food was amazing & delicious my kids enjoyed very much. Ambience was beautiful (Restaurante, pool, room etc) and very approachable polite staff. Internet was powerful comparing to other 5 different hotels so far we already visited. Merry Christmas & Happy New Year :) Zeya & Aziz",positive

I loved the hotel and would like to come back every winter if i have the chance and the hotel management is very friendly and the feeling of swimming while seeing the beach and this feeling can't be compared to anything else,positive
This is an amazing hotel i loved the view frm here i would love to stay more and explore the area of the hotel. ... the pool here is also good nd very big.... the food here is also nice nd the service is also nice i mean the people here are soooooo polite 😇😇,positive
"The wonderful staff made it a very special for me and my family from the time we checked in. From food to room service and everything else was very exceptional. With so much more to do at the premises you hardly feel the day pass by. The rooms were in excellent condition and very comfortable. I will definitely be back spending More time here in future in my next holiday to Sri Lanka. If you are looking to spend time next to the beach , Heritance Ahungalla is the place to be.",positive
It.was an amazing hotel because it has a great view of the sea and the service is good and the people who work always have a smile.... The food is delicious and the spaghetti is very tasty.... The rooms are very good with great view... Sure we will come back,positive
I must say that the staff is very lovely specially Anushka & Dayal and the pool staff.. The rooms is lovely and we are staying in the cliff Richards suite... And the housekeeping is very good always decorates our room.. .. The food is excellent...,positive
"We stayed for 6 nights at the Heritance Ahungulla. It's a nice hotel, we had a luxury double room facing the sea which was spacious and comfy bed. The only thing that lets this place down slightly is the food as you get a bit sick of it after a while, so definitely venture out of resort. Also, watch the hawkers out on the street if you go outside the gates to go to the local shop across the road. They are on you as soon as the gates are closed, asking you if you'd like to see gems, have massages or see spice gardens etc. One even tried to get in a tuk tuk with us, however we politely told him to get out. Good staff, but our room cleaner was hanging around us too much after we had tipped him one day; like he wanted more. Just made me feel a bit uneasy. Apart from that it was somewhere good to stay.",neutral
Had a wonderful experience. Friendly staff amazing food and very comfortable rooms with so much more. From the time We entered the hotel to the time We left they made sure we were well taken care of. Want to come back for sure to enjoy comforts to the fullest.,positive
Being a Sri Lankan living away from my country I never miss to pay a visit to Heritance Ahungalla. The hotel is so relaxing opened to the beach and facing a lovely pool. The staff is so friendly with an excellent service in a timely manner. Recommend this hotel to anyone who would want to experience true local hospitality and relax enjoying the lovely beach down south,positive
Best Hotel I ever gone. The best service and very friendly Team.& very helpful for any issues. I also recommend the food as it was very tasty.also the rooms are very clean . I hope to visit every vacation as this was my best place to come.,positive
"I think this is most exciting experience in a hotel. The way people's are treating, caring about the visitors are fabulous. Accommodation facilities are fantastic very good condition mentioned by the hotel management, security also in very high level. No any word to explain about the meal what we had in the hotel. Those are very clear delicious and very healthy also no any doubt about the anything. Hotel staff also very helpful to any visitors no any separate treat to any local or foreign. This is a nice and warm experience. Keep doing good service what you are already supply. Best of luck to your every success Thanks you very much for giving us a fabulous services",positive
"We arrived at the hotel after almost 20 hours by plane and found out that espresso coffee is a special coffee and will have to pay, although it has the same taste and in no case was an espresso. I mention that we had an all-inclusive supplement and the coffee was included First Breakfast: i wanted an omelette I asked the chef to prepare ""well done"", but he became visibly irritated because I have explained in more detail. He said something in his language, evading after I asked him what he said. I inspected the room where I was staying and found that under the bed were traces of visible dust probably old before those who have been staying here previously, the bathroom is not the bathroom of a 5stars hotel. The towels are to used and have old stains. On the ceiling we discovered traces of mosquito / dead flies on the ceiling of the bathroom The beach behind the hotel filled with annoying vendors that are allowed by the security agents even inside of the hotel property limit. We found the waiters mostly unprepared, lazy and disinterested. At the pool if you order a drink lasts an eternity. In fact, if you order anything in this hotel last an eternity. The food at dinner buffet is an ordinary cantine and you can easily see that they recycle the food from evening to another or is the same food. The concept of all inclusive is a joke, because there are only a few types of local drinks and those bad. Beach towels are to used and have old stains. We chose the restaurant ""fine dining"", but the disappointment continued. We first drink comes after 15 minutes, and the food was brought after an hour of waiting and although you must have 15 / discount due prepaid package of all inclusive, we were charged 100 / requires that the next day to ask for explanations, explanations that reduced bill. However, the food is typical of a normal restaurant. Not bad, but nothing special. I have to mention that in the fine dining restaurant were only 2 tables with people. It was empty! The new years evening was ok, but we wanted to order champagne and they told us they are out of stock. We wanted Moet, they gave us Mumm. How can you not have stocks of champagne for New Years Eve? The food was very good. If this have been the food for all the holiday i could have forgot all the other things At 14.30 in the nect day the room was not cleaned in the context in which We left at 9 am the room. I ordered a soft drink included in all-inclusive package, it was added to the bill and replaced at the my request. Conclusion: if you're not careful pay twice. Wishing to relax at the beach we waited 30 minutes for the staff to find sun beds towels. Another breakfast: I asked two omelets ( for me and my husband) everything OK, I asked him and the third omelets for my son and the cook was getting nervous. The adventure continues... For sure the hotel management will have a respond to this post, but it will not make any difference , because my new years eve holiday was ruined, so I recommend you avoid this hotel that can be classified as no more than one 4-star hotel!",negative
Returned to Heritance Ahungalle after 7 long years. The quality of service was excellent and was reminisce of our past experiences of this hotel. The quality and choice of food has improved to a level that is on par with the famed Heritance Kandalama.,positive

"Heritance Ahungalla is blessed with some of the most experienced staff some of whom, have been working there for more than 10 years which may be the reason why we felt it like home during our stay.

"We stayed here, and It was an amazing experience. The staff was excellent and the service was remarkable. The issue we had, however was the pool. There were people in the pool wearing ordinary clothes. Which is so off-putting and unhygienic. You are supposed to wear swimming attire and wash yourself before getting into the pool. This made us feel very uncomfortable and surprisingly the hotel management didn't seem to take notice of it either. Then when we went to the second pool, there was another couple the lady was dipping with her clothes on! This is not the type of environment we expect from a classy hotel. I really hope that the management takes required steps and fix the issue. Other than that it was a great stay and an extremely hospitable hotel.",neutral
I really love this hotel.staff is amazing.. Food is outstanding..... Rooms are clean and beautiful view...evening entertainment is very relaxing.truly nice place to relax the holiday...... Thank you...we will come back for sure...,positive

We just returned from a 5 day vacation at Heritance Ahungalla. The architecture is beautiful and the building itself is of national heritage importance. We stayed in a junior suite overlooking the ocean which was extremely well appointed. The staff were friendly and attentive without exception and are led to an impressive and highly experienced management team. The hotel is due for an overhaul/refreshment in May-November and should be completely amazing when it re-opens. Be sure to visit the sea turtle sanctuary about 1km North from the Hotel. This hotel is on my 'must visit list' for our next Sri Lankan vacation.,positive

"We checked out from a another down South Resort within few hours of checking in due to very bad experience in service. We were a party of 10 and needed 4 rooms for the night desperately. Through friend's recommendation, we called ""Super Taprobane Tours Pvt Ltd"" while on the move towards Ahungalle from Koggala. Super Taprobane contact person Mr.Mohideen confirmed the 4 rooms within 10 minutes of calling even though it was high season and the hotel was almost on full capacity but we were lucky enough to get the rooms as we had no place to go. Thank you Mr.Mohideen for your prompt assistance and the surprised complimentary upgrades which we received due to your assistance. Reached the hotel as scheduled within 1 hour and was greeted by Mr.Lakshita the Manager. Not only we got 4 rooms next to each other we got 1 luxury suite as well for the same price as the other 3 deluxe rooms as complimentary upgrade. It was such a treat and wonderful feeling. Just few hours back we were miserably let down by one down south resort to find this resort with super customer service. Thank you Mr.Lakshita for the personal greetings at the reception. Rooms were wonderful and spacious. The restaurant was fantastic . We had the night buffet & breakfast buffet. There are plenty to choose from and certainly a very generous buffet spread. The F&B Manager Mr.Thushara was equally attentive to our every need at the restaurant as we had 2 young children as well. A big thank you also to Mr.Perveen at the restaurant who made sure my daughter had a freshly brewed hot lemon tea with ginger & honey at stand by as she was having a sore throat. Mr.Perveen made sure another hot pot of tea was delivered to our room before bedtime and again 7.30am in the morning. Was so impressed with the care given at this hotel staff I would come again and recommend to anyone who wishes to stay in Ahungalle. Unfortunately we had to leave for Colombo the next day due to other commitments or else this would have been an ideal place to be for rest of our vacation. The beach stretch is quite vast . Even though it was high tide at the time we went for our ocean dip, it was still fantastic to be in the waters and watch the sun set. There are 2 pools which was equally good and many other facilities which we could not explore . Will come back during summer 2016 for a longer stay. Checked in 28th December. Stayed 1 night",positive
"Very good hotel with very friendly staff!!Good food And good service.The new year eve was fantastic with a huge buffet, nice entertainment and an amazing firework!! Definitly a place to stay in when visiting Ahungalla.",positive
"The view of the beach and rolling waves from our rooms was awesome and overwhelming and has left enduring positive vibes that will always remain with us. The rooms itself were amazing and very comfortable supported by a very efficient service staff. The overall ambience was mind blowing and the complete staff were friendly, helpful, extremely courteous and above all very professional. We brought in the New year with such a bang with the whole hotel dressed for the occasion. The setting was most imaginative around the pool The food was delicious and had a vast variety of dishes. This lovely hotel is the answer to a family holiday. There is so much it offers that not only children but grown ups as well will enjoy Lastly I want to thank and complement the whole staff for making our trip so memorable Thank you and looking forward to returning soon Bobby",positive
It was perfect night every thing was.inI it's place and nice it was fabulous night for suite dance floor was so exciting the competitions was interesting particularity the queen one.the staff also were so helpful and friendly next year with family,positive
I stayed here for 5 days.. The hotel is excellent and the staff is brilliant and friendly. The two pool was the highlight for me. I wish I could stay longer but have to go back :( .. I'm already planning to return soon!!,negative
"The rooms were very clean. The pool of the hotel was huge and was maintained very well. However, when we checked in, the staff took ages to give us a room because it was not ready at that time. Even they took another half hour to bring out luggage into the room. We came to the hotel at about 7pm, and their normal check in time is 2pm, so they had ample time to prepare the room for us. We wanted an extra bed and so told the reception at the time of check in, but they brought the extra bed at around 10 in the night. At lunch on the second day, their was a live insect in the passion fruit dessert and when we told the staff they just took it away and didn't bother to apologize. Then at check out, they manipulated us to give 5 stars and write a good review on trip advisor. No wonder it has a rating of 4.5 on trip advisor. Overall the service was poor and not to our satisfaction.",negative
"What a theme for a new Year.... It was indeed a service beyond the horizon as the Heritance Ahungalla'd wish. We came to know they have won Sri Lankan culinary art competition for 3 times in 2010,2013,2015 and we were most fortunate enough to get our pictures at the photo booth where it was mentioned "" culinary Hall Fame "" on 31st night the hotel was incredibly decorated to suite their theme.superb illumination added small space shuttle came through their main pool. From the space shuttle a little chef came out and delivered their massage from the future , """" we are the future of culinary art in Heritance Ahungalla and we will be the champions in 2050""... And we saw few other little chefs dresser and prepared to take chief guests to open the Gala dinner..., This is the first time in our life , saw a main course of gala dinner with so much of verities and the buffet spread was laid over 25m length on the beach front. So many different food corners with action station and they have named each station as planets. Food was delicious and varieties were found from round the world. Just behind the buffet a whole new world with robots and of course we saw our solar Galaxy . Illuminated perfectly. Salad corner and desert corner was like the milky way Galaxy. Mouthwatering deserts to place the international palate was remarkable.main restaurant was converted into a feast and we had everything we like. Now we believe why the hotel won so many awards and been culinary champs in Sri Lanka.... What a surprise to see in this small paradise , a beauty pageant with international participation made a glamour and pride to the new year . Never forget to tell the entertainment and music . They did a superb job and everybody on the dance floor even past mid night . My self and my friends had the most amazing and best stay by far in this hotel. Their services were amazing , nothing to complain. Every staff member with a smile went extra mile to help you to be comfortable. It's an incredible service with homely luxury. They made me cry the way they greet each other at the dawn of new year with so much care, love and togetherness from the staff member to management team. A big salute for you all and I have never seen such in anywhere and we wish them all the very best for many years to come. It was truly a Hollywood film that I am sure will hit box-office records. For us it was a lifetime design,an amazing robotic service and we had a perfect new year eve and a first class pampering with Heritance. We will definitely return to this magical location and will recommend all our friends a must visit in Sri Lanka....",positive
"I spent the Christmas weekend at the hotel. An absolutely beautiful property with a beautiful clean stretch of beach and the most mesmerizing sunsets! The major failure was the room. It was quite small and old and definitely wasn't maintained properly. Cleanliness of the room was not up to par for the price I paid especially during the peak holiday season. From table tops to curtains to the wash room, here was dust all over as if it was not cleaned in months. I had to clean the blow dryer with a wet tissue to get the dirt out before using it! There was also a very old TV in the room. Food was okay, not great but the staff was very friendly and very helpful. It makes your stay a worthy one against all odds. There are two great pools and a garden with a lot of trees. Well maintained and the pool staff was very friendly and helpful. I would definitely like to go back if the room quality and standards improves in the future.",neutral

Even though the staff have been working around the clock for this event, every single one of them has a big smile on their face and are committed to making us feel special as we see out the end of 2015. I couldn't imagine being anywhere else in the world to see in the new year!",positive
Very Well organised party . Massive buffet with mouthwatering gourmet food covering every continent .

Every year we somehow try to visit Heritance Ahungalla for the vacation to experience their excellent service.

It is our home away from home. Everytime when we visit here we leave the hotel with lasting memories. At every touch point the service rendered is outstanding.

Heritance family is truly a service oriented entity where memorable impressions are created assuring the guest to come back again and again. Keep up the good work going!,positive

"We spent our one year anniversary at Heritance Ahungalle on an impromptu night away. Upon arriving we were greeted with a welcome drink (from a selection of wood apple juice, fresh pineapple juice and cordial) and a wet face towel. We filled in some paperwork and after a bit of a wait they said that they upgraded us to the junior suite as it was our anniversary. Heritance is quite a large resort and we were shown to our room. The room was pretty good, clean and well-appointed. They had made up an ornamental thing with the towels. Cute. The bathroom was a bit disappointing to be honest - made up of smoothed concrete and dark tiles, it just didn't look that pleasant. More a design opinion I guess. Otherwise it was clean. The resort on the whole is a bit dated and can show it from time to time as the various facilities were either unused or looking a bit shoddy. Wifi was free, reliable and available everywhere. One thing I can't fault is the service which was impeccable. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff and they were very helpful and made sure we were having a good time. They had prepared a small cake for our anniversary dinner which was also a nice thought. The beach was really nice with firm and fine sand that felt like you were walking on clay. Overall a nice stay, with some refurbishment work it could be even better.",positive
This hotel is very beautiful and it's a lovely place ... This hotel has a relaxing atmosphere... The food every item was delicious... The soups was the best out of all... The rooms are very comfortable and felt like home ... As a family we enjoyed a lot... The staff and the service is also good... The Christmas decorations are also very beautifully done and the kids event like making faluda with the chefs and was awesome... Loved it here...,positive
"We have stayed at Heritance Ahungalla several times, and find its a lovely hotel with excellent food and great, courteous, helpful and friendly staff. The kids loved swimming in the pool, table tennis, badminton and the gym. As teenagers, they spent all their time outdoors. The live music at the bar had us on our feet dancing away! The wide range of food in all the buffet meals were delicious and we were even given a tour of the kitchen which was very interesting. We have enjoyed our stay here, I would recommend it to all my friends in Melbourne :)",positive
Very good hotel it has good food and it is clean .the stuff make their best to serve the guests as best as they can .the Spa in it is good You can take a nice relax in its huge gardens .the location of the hotel is good. In general it is a very good choice we have made,positive
"Relaxing ambiance. Very Clean, variety of food, very friendly staff. Direct on the beach. Lovely and cosy hotel . Great hospitality. Also some activities areavailable like diving, billiard... Thank you",positive
Environment is very good and there are friendly staff. But food is not good as I expected compare to the other heritance hotels. Good place to play beach sports. This is a good place to have a family or business vacation stay.,neutral
This is one of the super gorgeous hotels I have visited in Sri Lanka... The food very very delicious and has a wide variety ... The rooms are very beautiful and has a wonderful view... Love the ambiance and the environment... The service is excellent and the staff is very good toooo......,positive
Very nice place. Great ambience.The room is very good and service is very good. Arrival service was great.The swimming pool and the beach are the best part of it. The staff is good. The breakfast today was amaZing. Dinner on arrival was not that good,positive
"Great ambiance ,excellent staff and great architecture. Over all a superh experience. Must visit!! The room was also very airy and erll maintained. Clean beach and clean sorroundings as well. Many earing options insidr the hotel which make it difficult to leave the hotel",positive
"We walked into Heritance on a Christmas day, after a drive from Colombo. The place gets your attention, right from the main gate, the extended green and the water body which seems to extend all the way onto the horizon! The front desk and check in process is extremely courteous, a couple of notches higher than most places I have experienced in Sri Lanka. Which takes some getting to, considering Sri Lankan hotels are among the friendliest across the globe. Rooms were spacious and well maintained, we had a set of three sea facing deluxe rooms, with ample balconies to laze and watch the sea and sun. Food was good, not extraordinary, but definitely above average. Breakfasts were centerpiece, a good balance of Sri Lankan and Global cuisine. Though I did feel, there could be some more tables on the lawns. The insides, especially during this time of the year, does get a little crowded. Enough for families to do. Two pools, a sand volleyball court, two tennis courts, a badminton court, a table tennis table tucked in a corner and a large number of beach chairs for those that are horizontally inclined! There were social activities to keep the kids busy. Conveniently located enroute to a Galle, Bentota and other places of interest in the Southern province. There is little that you can do in Ahungalla itself. A couple of beach shacks a few hundred meter on either sides of the main gate takes care of times when you want to just step out for a bit. Definitely, coming back some time in not too distant a future.",positive
This beautiful hotel is located at southern coastal area. Beach is very clean and safe. Restaurant is very clean and it's staff is very supportive and friendly. Meals are great. nice friendly staff on the help desk Very clean room and wash room is very clean. Beautiful clean swimming pools,positive
"Wow, don't hesitate to book! We had a terrible time with hotels.com who's room info is incorrect and who are so so bad a dealing with problems, avoid them at all costs. Heritance is a gem though. My first time in Asia meant the style of the place was not what I am used to, but after a day here the beauty of the place became obvious. The building and rooms, although not in pristine, are clean and nice looking. The staff are exceptionally friendly. The Sri Lankan buffet is off the scale amazing!! We ate this morning noon and night and still can't get enough! The grounds and pools are great and there's no issue with getting a sunbed as the 150 odd rooms share 2 great big pools and ample grounds. The Christmas Eve dinner they put on is magical, seriously delicious food and the grounds where you eat at night are full of white fairy light covered trees - for our honeymoon I can't imagine anywhere more romantic. Ahungalla is a small village type place with nothing to do but we just had our own personal taxi drive us to hikkaduwa market, Galle old town and back, and the whole trip cost £30 odd. Brave a tuk tuk and I'm sure you could do it for half that. Can't wait to see what New Year's Eve has in store, we've heard it's another fantastic night like Christmas eves feast. I can't compare this hotel as its not the same as European western style hotels, but I can tell you it's romantic, relaxing and the Sri Lankan food on offer is outstanding! And b******y hot.",positive
"We had a lovely family break over the Christmas vacation. A good hotel with friendly and helpful staff. That with the always good 'Spence hotel' food, you have an excellent experience. Spacious and comfortable rooms. Good amenities which include a large pool. Lovely beach.",positive
"For last 20 years we have been in and out of this lovely place. Their service is superb. Wonderful, friendly and caring staff who are dedicated to serve the guests at anytime of the day. A must visit hotel in Sri Lanka. 👍👍👍👍👍",positive

The place is really nice and the service is good. staff is friendly and very attentive. Food is really good and have a good variety. It was a hotel that maintained good hospitality. The treatment did not differ from foreigner to the local.,positive

"Lovely property, quite sprawling.. You can wander around the gardens, the beautiful beach, groves of coconut trees or swim in their two big pools. The hotel itself is quite a lovely sight specially when u enter n see the pond flowing into the pool flowing into the sea. The rooms are nice and their 5 bars are stocked well enough with great views. The only drawback with this place is the sub par food, though their buffets are quite good they can't really run an a la carte service from a perspective id device or food quality",positive
"Spacious rooms with nice balconies and large buffet. Nice beach and a clean pool. Beautiful Christmas decorations and perfect lighting. Has lots of we'll kept courts eg- table tennis, tennis, badminton, etc.",positive
"The rooms have great views. Housekeeping needs to be improved though. Soaps and shower gels, and basic amenities should be replaced daily. Otherwise a terrific venue and get away. The beach is on the doorstep and really great.",positive
"Heritance is easily one of the most beautiful and spacious hotels in Sri Lanka. We visited with a family group of 12 people, recieved rooms together, and were shown to our rooms as soon as we arrived. The service and quality of the hotel is incredible. Stunning rooms and a lovely beach, it really lives up to it's ratings. The pool is one among many highlights, but all in all, Heritance created an experience we truly loved during our christmas holidays. Not to mention the gorgeous christmas decorations. 5/5.",positive
"Great facilities and friendly staff. Very nice pools. Plenty of extra activities such as table tennis, badminton and the gym which are enjoyable to use. I highly recommend coming here and bring your family also. Very enjoyable place to be, large, nice room.",positive
"The place is very beautiful staff are friendly and mostly helpful good cocktails nice sunset and full programme for holiday. Rooms are spacious and with a wonderful view, very good evening buffet Recommend for family vacation. Very nice decorations, too",positive
"Checked into the hotel on the Christmas Day. The hotel has a very nice feel but just don't carried away with the ambience. Our first couple of in room dining orders were very disappointing. The food was served cold ( real effort would have gone into that given the tropical climate) it had no local flavor, I mean the chili chicken was sweet. Anyways I have another couple of days to go hopefully will get some good food close by. I am not trying the hotel kitchen again.",negative
We feel like home in the Christmas time. Enjoy the excellent service and the delicious food. Our children got fun with the magic man it's a good experience to them. Location of the hotels is very nice and the garden very beautiful and relaxing. We love this place and hope to come again.,positive
enjoyed a lot .thank u heritance for the excellent service.enjoy the delicious meal.hope that we spend the christmas happily with herritance. we will recomend this place to our all friends... come and experience the hospitality of heritance ahungalla...,positive
"On the positive side the hotel complex delivered everything its website claimed. The location on the beach gives it an added attraction. The staff were very friendly, pleasant and efficient. Going out of their way to help guests. The dining areas, for the all inclusive guests, provided a range of cold and hot meals from a wide range of cuisines. The deserts were also extensive. The room (deluxe sea view in my case) was spacious and had all the facilities you required, including mini bar and TV. The on suite was also spacious with a walk in shower. However a couple of points down graded this review from an excellent to a very good. The interior walls of the end suite were unfinished plaster (whether by design or unfinished) and would have benefitted by a coat of paint. If the unfinished surface was meant to add to the design, it failed. In the bedroom area the brass light fittings were hung very low and did not give great illumination. Difficult to read at night. Lifting the light fittings would be a simple solution. One light fitting was so low over a desk area that it required dexterity to access the kettle or the power points. The pools at the complex were both excellent catering for both splashers and serious swimmers. I am unaware if there were any water sport facilities on the beach area as during my stay the red flags were displayed. All in all a pleasant stay which could be improved by minor changes to the room.",positive
"We had a Great time with heritance ahungalla... We came here with my family...from the arrival to till departure we got excellent service from lovely staff...

"My family and i stayed at Ahungalle for a couple of days starting Christmas eve. Even though we do come here frequently this was our first stay for Christmas It was fantastic. To start with the Christmas decor was vibrant yet unique it featured robots lit up and some in bright red hues ! The entertainment was very good and the kids enjoyed the sing along Carols, the party hats and bon bons.The food was sumptuous and the buffet included everything conceivable from oysters to Christmas turkey, lamb and lobster. The staff was friendly, accommodating and the rooms were classy and comfortable. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and firmly wowed to come back.",positive

"It was my first time at all-inclusive resort and I wasn't disappointed at all. Great place in great location with great, friendly and helpful staff. Place is big enough to always find something for to do or just get away from crowd: two pools, gym, library, tennis courts and snooker table. First time saw rooms serviced twice a day! I also used spa; it was bit expensive compared to other things but good quality massage. (It was grad trip so many things were organized in advance)",positive
"My very brief stay at Heritance Ahungalla was a great one. I arrived at the hotel with the intention of having Christmas lunch with my family and I must say, we were all very satisfied. We were greeted by the staff who treated us with great hospitality. Lunch was absolutely divine. My favourite was the roast pumpkin soup. A must have if you are here for the weekend. We will surely come back in the near future :)",positive

It has been a pleasant experience staying here. The service staff were very helpful and courteous. Would come back for another stay for sure. The beach is clean and very private. Two pools with great views and very family friendly.,positive
"This hotel lived up to its reputation of excellent food, typical Sri Lankan hospitality and true comfort. There could have been a few more activities for small children, but the two pools and easy access to the beach made up for it.",positive
"It was a great experience and it was in fact a wonderful and pleasant atmosphere. Facilities, hospitality and food are superb! Above all overall cleanliness is also highly admirable. Cordial and well mannered staff is also commendable. All in all I gladly give 5 stars and a thumbs up for everything! I strongly recommend this resort to spend your valuable vacation!",positive

"What a wonderful place to stay. The service was very good, the rooms were great, the view spectacular. The management went that extra mile to ensure that we had a memorable and very comfortable stay. Everything was perfect. From the exquisite a la carte private dinner on the beach; where we dined on a delicious 4 course menu, handmade chocolates and a cake specially made for our guests. To the welcome that we received and private tour of the kitchen, museum and incredible chocolate carving by the extremely talented and lovely sous chef. I highly recommend Heritance Ahunghalla. Thank you to Refhan Razeen Executive General Manager for ensuring that we had such a memorable stay. We will see you again I'm sure.",positive
"It was a pleasurable stay from the begining.. Had a Warm welcome on arrival with quick check in under nice lobby that has the view of indian ocean over the infinity pool. Fascinating christmas decorations make the feeling of season. Room is large and clean with all amenities with fabulous ocean view. Out of the door step of the room was the pool, that is covered by a large tree with branches touching the water made the feeling of dipping in a natural pool. Dinner and the breakfast was Excellent with good spread and taste. Should specifically thank the Staff, All are well trained, friendly and willing to go for a extra mile anytime..!!",positive
We were in Heritance Ahungalla with our family... There services was fantastic. Specially in the restaurant. Good varieties of foods was very nice. We all enjoyed. two swimming pools we like too. We would like to recommend this nice hotel to our friends.,positive

"Great hotel, all facilities were excellent. They are very eco friendly and accomodating to special requests such as dietary restrictions. Staff are very kind, thoughtful, and seen genuinely passionate about their work. Definitely recommend",positive
"This hotel scores immensely on its location and environment. Being situated right in front of a beautiful southern beach of Sri Lanka we got to witness some of the most picturesque sunsets ever while also being able to quiet strolls along the beach around dawn. The two pools in the hotel are quite spacious and very clean. One pool named the ""green pool"" provides an excellent area for relaxing as it is shaded by a tree that grows above it. The rooms are very clean and comfortable. The housekeeping staff is also very friendly and efficient. When talking about the restaurant, the food is superb in taste and quality. Though there is a lot of room for improvement in the service in the restaurant the food pretty much compensates for that. Last but not least the staff at the front desk and guest relations were awesome. Very friendly and efficient, and quite skilled in convincing me to write this review and give 5stars.",positive
"Perhaps the best hotel stay I've ever experienced - ALL of the staff were extremely warm, friendly and service oriented to the point that we were perhaps too well taken care of! They vastly surpassed any expectations I had, to the detriment of all hotels I shall stay at again. We ate at each of the outlets the hotel has to offer, from the 24 hour dining option to the fine dining restaurant, and the food quality was phenomenal at all of them. I would strongly recommend their Sri Lankan dishes, as the hotel has been directly responsible for my newfound appreciation of their cuisine. Egg hoppers and curry for breakfast. Not my usual fare, but truly fantastic. I stayed in a suite overlooking their landscaped areas, one of their two large pools and the ocean. Marvellous. Very well appointed, with sun-loungers and a dining table on the balcony, so you can read, have a nap or a snack / meal in seclusion and peace. Dining on the beach was great, and although on one night there was a slight tropical shower, the staff made sure we could still enjoy the experience. Super troopers. The spa was also excellent, and although the jacuzzi is not warmed, it was perfect after a while in the sauna. We took daily treatments, and the therapists were very good. The easiest way to get there is to walk along the grass past the buffet restaurant parallel to the shore. The beach is directly in front of the hotel, and perhaps the best part was that it was not crowded. Perfect to unwind, which was our objective on this trip, and was definitely achieved in no small part to the staff of this wonderful property. Thank you all. P.S. There are some squirrels that hang out in the trees by the pool. Get some pineapple from the barman, and they will come to eat out your hand!",positive
"We picked this hotel to go for a family vacation during the December season and stayed for 2 nights. I had been to this hotel a couple of times before and the one thing I will say that has remained consistent over the years is the food. The food was superb with a huge selection and the Sri Lankan food especially was out of this world. Apart from the food, it's worthy to mention the great service given by the staff. We reached the hotel a bit early, but 3 out of our 4 rooms were given to us 1 hour before the check-in time. Being the peak season, this definitely came as a pleasant surprise. Chathuranga the manager was especially helpful to us with a few requests as we were traveling with a 1 year old baby and nothing we asked for ever seemed to be too much. The 2 pools are situated in an ideal manner, with one out in the sun and the other under a low hanging tree with a lot of shade. We loved the pool with the shade as we could keep the baby in there for a long period. The beach near the hotel is private and lovely. Will definitely visit this hotel again.",positive

"Being one of the flagship hotels of the aitkenspence organisation, this hotel meets the standards that one would come to expect from a hotel of such stature. Though under staffed in some aspects of service, the staff are quite humble and friendly. The rooms and over all architecture of the hotel displays the class. The food speaks for itself, the hotel boasting the best variety I have come across so far. While there is room for improvement, the hotel has a very bright future and i wish the staff and administration all the very best.",positive

We were visiting family in sri lanka and were looking for a nice beach destination in December and were very happy that we found the Heritance Ahungalla. Very friendly staff that went above and beyond to keep us happy. We were traveling with a 15 month old baby and the staff made a fresh meal every time with and also sent food to our room a couple of times as the baby fell a sleep during dinner. Very clean and family friendly beach. Rooms and bathrooms were well kept and clean. Will definitely revisit. Thank you to everyone at Heritance that made our stay extra special.,positive

"We had our staff trip here. Kind and friendly staff. During our stay we experience kind hospitality from most of the staff, be it reception, Restaurant(The best I must mention) pool staff and the security.The good thing about this hotel I noticed was the prompt service. It was a pleasure meeting Mr. Thushara Gnanarathnam(A senior staff member),who was apparently a reality TV star in Sri Lanka not so long ago, and his kind hospitality. - Family friendly, specially if you are travelling with kids. - Two swimming pools and a Jacuzzi close to one pool.",positive

You don't feel like leaving this place once you come here! The food it's amazing.. There's a variety of food and desert you can select and the rooms are so nice and perfect! We hope to return soon!,positive
"The service presented by the very friendly staff,was indeed wonderful. however I would have preferred if the evening tea was served to us, along with a snack. There are several activities. One cannot get bored at Heritance",positive

It's a terrific place for a family vacation. Service is excellent . The staff is extremely friendly and helpful in every possible way. The ambiance and the atmosphere of this unique hotel makes you feel so calm and relaxing. They take extra special care to provide you the most amazing experience during every meal that you cannot help but fill your stomach to the fullest. This is yet another wonder by one of the worlds most renounced architects Mr. Geoffrey Bawa that one has to visit and stay and enjoy .,positive
We feel at home every time we step in to this lovely hotel. Breathtaking architecture blends with human touch of professional staff makes everything beautiful. Sumptuous international and local cuisines are up to the world class and the warmth of staff makes you feel so good. Lovely place,positive
"It was a wonderful stay. However we would have preferred to have more varieties for the buffets. The main courses mostly consisted of rice. Other activities should be available at least till 8 in the night, including outdoor activities.",neutral
This wasn't my first time to heritance ahungalla but every time I come here I experience the same thing. An excellent service. From their food to accommodations to their staff. They ensure that we have a very good time when we come here and also makes sure that we are satisfied and content when we leave.,positive
"Have been to the hotel regularly over the last ten years, now it's almost like coming home. The senior staff recognise us and always make us feel welcome. Especially good for families, two great pools and right next to the sea as well as great buffet for adults and kids. I believe the hotel is being refurbished shortly (in 2016) which will make it even better. Would recommend this as a relaxed and homely resort by the beach.",positive

Beautiful venue. Very nice staff especially the restaurant crew. Unique pool. Friday night cultural show was amazing. Beautiful sandy beach. Approximately two hours from Colombo. Worth the visit. Although we experienced two power cuts it didn't affect us as we were out on the beach most of the time. Rooms are reasonably good but I'm not sure it's 5 star quality as they say.,positive
"Had a great time staying for one night with my family. The location is great, right on the beach side with beautiful views. We got deluxe and premium rooms, there was not much difference between the two types. The pool was amazing! Had two to choose from and the residence pool which had beautiful trees surrounding and above it. I have not been in a pool like this before. The Cultural show on Friday night was also very entertaining and made the stay better. Would not recommend if you want access to power constantly as we experienced short power cuts in the rooms. But it was not an issue for us as we spent most of the time outside.",positive
"Rooms - Room was big but not ocean facing. Food- vegetarian options very disappointing. Location - Long walk Beach- amazing and beautiful Ambiance - very nice Staff - friendly Thank you.......,,,......",negative

"We have being frequent visitors at this hotel and have stayed pretty much in every room in every floor. All deluxe rooms are fitted for the comfort of the guests. A wonderful service offered by every single employee of the hotel from the moment you step into the hotel. Not to mention the view, the pool and the amazing buffet they provide. No matter the amount of guests they always manage to provide a buffet that caters to all. If you need a time out of colombo this is the hotel to stay. We always choose Heritance Ahungalla. Be ready to be dazzled by the great service. Thank you for being amazing from the moment we checked in.",positive
"It's an amazing place I recommend to everyone, a family, a couple, group of friends,...etc to have a great time. A very beautiful hotel that's built in an eye catching way every corner. The food is also really good and the staff is friendly. Have been here about 10 times and will never get sick of it. Also, has many photographic opportunities and sites. Can't think of any negatives honestly. Enjoy xx",positive
This is our first visit to this amazing beach resort.... perfect location.. pools were nice. Gym is excellent. Even in the hot sun you can enjoy at the green pool and we really enjoyed at outhe side jacuzzi. ..food is great and staff is friendly...,positive
"As the Heritance is shortly to undergo major renovations I won’t comment about the room. The staff were excellent going above and beyond what was asked or required. Our check-in was very slow and not what was wanted after a long day of travelling – I’m sure this will all be remedied once renovations are completed. The two pools were very clean and delightful to swim in. We had the all-inclusive package and couldn’t fault the food, drinks or service. The food really was amazing – different dishes featured at all buffets and as we stayed six nights can honestly state the variety was excellent. Our week at the Heritance was a lovely way to finish our very busy and action filled holiday. I’m sure once those renovations are completed the Heritance will be even more enjoyable. Coming from Australia I probably will not return to Sri Lanka but certainly appreciated everything we saw and did.",positive

The place is nice and the worker at the hotel as well as the local people are really kind and enjoy service. There is a few options of trios around the hotel But It always takes a while To move from one place To Another given the level of infrastructure In the country.,positive
"We had our wedding at Heritance Ahungalla in May this year, and it was an experience that our friends and family have not stopped raving about! Our stay at the hotel was amazing, the staff were exceptional in their service and the location is breathtaking. The day of our wedding there was a monsoon storm that destroyed our marquee as we were having an outdoor wedding on the beach, which almost didn't happen. The staff, especially KK, helped pull this together before we ever knew what had happened and made this one of the best days of our lives. I can not rave enough about this hotel. We had family and friends stay here from all over Australia and all around the world who have been left with the best of memories . Well done Heritance Ahungalla, we can't wait to visit you again!",positive
"The food, the services and the attitude of the staff was truly amazing! The staff was so polite and friendly and capable. The ability to be able to handle huge groups is an added advantage. I can definitely recommend Heritance Ahungalla to anyone......",positive
The architecture of this hotel is very beautifully done that special credit goes to Goeffry Bawa .... the environment is sooo beautiful very calm and a very cool atmosphere .... the rooms are fantastic the food is even more fantasticc and the staff and the service is excellent,positive
"This is absolutely not a 5 star resort - not by international or Sri Lankan standards. Everything from the small room to the aged gym and very basic amenities was a disappointment. The food is admittedly excellent but the restaurant staff have absolutely no sense of how to host more than 100 people. On the whole, the staff are friendly but typically clueless. Basic hotel processes such as charging drinks to a room or booking a spa appointment have proved very trying. Their cashier desk is simply a joke - patrons have to go to a little room in the back of reception to make small payments, as if they are in some bizarre 1950s public administration building. The overall impression is in fact an insult to guests who are paying a significant premium for their stay.",negative
This is a very very beautiful hotel the atmosphere and the environment is sooo beautiful.... And most of all the beach its so fantastic.... And soooo clean.. The rooms are very clean and my room had a great view and a private balcony.....the staff andvthe service is excellent tooo. Food is awesome.... We eill come back definitly ... Best ever,positive

"Amazing resort with a nice sandy beach, great view, and an awesome pool. Nice friendly and helpful staff. Would recommend it for very large groups - we were a few hundred of us, and the resort managed us very well - both operationally and in terms of food and activities.",positive
"Fantastic service and food. We were a group of 400 visitors who did graduation trip in Sri Lanka. Definitely a great choice because we had every thing that we need in this famous resort, from great food to great alcohol and awesome facilities!",positive
It's a nice place to live. there's very beautiful view in the hotel especially for the sunset. we came here for graduation trip and really enjoy the stay. The employees here are very nice and helpful. The small welcome ceremony is quite unique and full of local elements.,positive
from the time we walked in heritance ahungalle blew our minds away. from the staff and their beautiful smiles to the tasteful fusion cuisine. our days spent by the pool overlooking thr beach was pure bliss.. hands down i could safely say that this experience was one to remember in sri lanka. great hospitality by heritance :),positive
The hotel stay was just simply amazing. Hands down it was my best hotel stay in Sri Lanka. The staff was just so helpful. Even at like 3oclock in the morning they were on point! The food made me travel back in time simply amazing. All in all I could just say I loved every minute of it.,positive
Wonderful service and staff. The food was amazing! Will definitely visit again :). Was here on a business trip for a short while and received great hospitality from the staff. Will definitely recommended. The hotel is right on the beach...,positive
"Arrived late following delayed flight and driver getting lost so we weren't in the best of moods. Felt we could have been offered some food instead of relying on the mini bar but I suppose we could have asked for it. Shown to a room which had a view of a tree right outside so changed that to a much better one overlooking the pool with a sea view. Much better but why are the bathrooms left with bare plaster? Don't get that one. The good times then began because Heritance is a wonderful hotel with excellent staff in a glorious position on a beautiful beach. Felt like Robinson Crusoe whenever I walked on it with waving palms behind me and my feet in the warm Indian Ocean. Only problem are the beach kawkers who don't take no for an answer and pester you to death. The big pool is awesome and the pool attendants outstanding at providing towels and mattresses very quickly. Food is a bit hit and miss. Breakfast is really good if you go in early; not so good if you go in late and food has not been re- refreshed. The evening buffet was exceptional on barbecue night but a little bland on other nights although there was always something to attract you. Desserts are very good as are the soups. Tried the a la carte restaurant once and the lobster was really good but took an eternity to come -odd with only two of us in there but great value for money. The hotel is made for relaxing and the staff go out of their way to help guests to enjoy their stay. We only had four days and we were really sorry to leave. When the sun is out and you're on your sunbed by the pool overlooking the beach, it just doesn't get any better! Will come again for a longer stay.",neutral
"Very friendly staff, good and fast service. I see friendly people all around. Nice view of pool and sea. Food is okay. Room is okay, but not ver impressed. The hotel has gym facility and table tennis.",positive
"Staff is good and friendly... Service is great.... The access to beach is easy.... I think the room is a bit old but it is still fine.... From airport to hotel is Abit far, about 2 hours but it is probably one of the nearest hotel resorts that is of such quality....",positive
As a family we enjoyed this hotel so so much..... My kids enjoyed the pool so much.. the rooms havre a very beautiful view... With lot of fascilities...the food is very delicious and has a variety of food tooo.... Will come bsck again...,positive
"We have stayed in this hotel for 4 days with a large group of students, and literally everybody loved the experience. The hotel went the extra mile and organised all kind of activities for us, such as beach sports, night activities and even a night rave. Also all the other guests that were not part of our group loved the hotel a lot, as the staff was so attentive to organise special activities for them as well. The food was delicious, the pool fantastic, the beach is of the nicest we have seen in Sri Lanka and the view on the east allowed for beautiful sunsets from all rooms. Thanks for these great four days!",positive
"We visited the hotel for 3 nights as part of our Honeymoon tour of Sri Lanka. The lobby with view through to the pool is amazing! Great to see when you arrive! The rooms are clean and well maintained and housekeeping kept them spotless throughout our stay. The variety in the buffet restaurant was good and we always had lots and lots to eat! The staff are amazing! Friendly, helpful, always doing everything they can to make sure you have everything you need or want. We would definitely stay here again if we were ever to return to the area.",positive

"We enjoyed our stay at Ahungalla Heritance with family. The food was great, the staff friendly and all amenities excellent. The beach was beautiful, not crowded at all when we went which made it even more enjoyable. A kids pool (or more shallow areas in existing pools) would be ideal. However, this didn't have a real impact on our holiday.",positive

Heritance Ahungalla is a wonderful hotel with spacious and clean rooms/baths. Stayed at a room overlooking sea. Balcony is ideal for an evening tea. Buffet spread is huge and mouthwatering. You get all kinds of dishes you could ever expect from a Sri Lankan hotel. It has two large pools. Very friendly staff and their service is excellent.,positive
"Two night full board stay. having an awesome time. location is fantastic, beautiful setting great pool and beach. What really captivates us the friendliness of the staff. As we arrived we are greeted very warmly and were checked in very promptly. short while later we realised there was a small problem with the door lock of our room. The staff promptly attended to it. The meal spread had a wide variety and the dining room staff have been exceptionally helpful (we were holidaying with two kids) - smiles all the way. We have stayed at many hotels in Sri Lanka (we are locals) and this is by far the best experience we have had. the friendliness factor is unparalleled in our experience.",positive

"Overall was a good experience. Stayed for two nights. Dinner was really good the second night. Unfortunately the beach was not clean. It's a public beach but the staff should probably make an effort to keep the surrounding area clean. Service was excellent except for the slightly annoying habit a few members of the staff had, of forcing guests to review the hotel on trip advisor and give a 5 star rating.",positive
We were warmly welcomed by hotel staff and arrange the check-in smoothly. The buffet was mouth watering and the spread was suitable for both vegetarians and non vegetarians. Nothing to complain about service from the time of booking till we check out. Staff was attending to details to make our stay a pleasant experience. Residents pool was a chill out place for all of us. The sea was in the vicinity and was clean and calm. I would recommend this hotel who is looking for good food and excellent service.,positive

"We chose Heritance Ahungalla as our wedding destination and have not been disappointed. Having looked at other hotel packages we felt the Heritance offered the best wedding services and surroundings for us as a couple and to accommodate the rest of our wedding party as we were a total of 18. We were greeted on arrival and upgraded on check in to a suite which was a nice first surprise. That evening we met with Shanika our wedding co-ordinator who assured us all was in hand and made final arrangements for flower styles, timings and general order of the day. Nothing was to much to ask and we felt totally confident that our day would go to plan. We had chosen to have a morning ceremony and unfortunately the rain was in full force at 10 am when we were due to start but we were assured they would wait until the rain stopped so we could have the beach ceremony we wanted. Within the hour the rain stopped and the ceremony started. We had traditional dancers and drummers to walk us through the hotel grounds to our decorated arch area on the beach. The ceremony was beautiful and concluded with cocktails and sparkling wine on the beach while we had photographs taken. We had a relaxed afternoon enjoying the glorious weather and were again upgraded to the top suite in the hotel which is just amazing!! In the evening we had arranged to have a table on the beach for our wedding party to enjoy a 5 course meal including perfectly cooked lobster! the table was surrounded by lanterns and really was the perfect setting and the service was impeccable. We followed our meal with a firework display which was the perfect ending to our day. We really cannot fault the hotel and the staff they have all been amazing throughout, they have done anything and everything they can to accommodate us and give us the perfect relaxed wedding we desired. Shanika who co-ordinated the wedding and Ranisha the trainee were both amazing and we are so pleased we chose the Heritance as our wedding destination.",positive

"Myself and boyfriend stayed here for a friends wedding. Having just travelled from a 5 star hotel from Malaysia we had the same expectation regarding the service from the hotel. The positive- the hotel rooms and views were fantastic, the swimming pools were so inviting and were visibly cleaned everyday. The hotel wasn't too busy so it there was space around the pool area and the food was good. The room cleaner always left us petals in the room which was a nice touch. The negative - even though we would be more than willing to give a tip after exceptional service it felt like a tip was expected for doing the basic job. For example when we first arrived we were ushered to the lobby and our bags were taken off us. A few minutes later we were showed to our room by one of the reception staff, as we all got into the room, she simply wouldn't go, she was there for a least 2/3 minutes and was very obvious she was waiting for a tip.1) we had no physical money on us at that time 2) she should have never assumed we would give her a tip for doing her basic job ( bad customer service) it just felt really uncomfortable. Our bags then arrived 5 minutes later to our room brought by 2 bell boy whom also waited for a tip- but my boyfriend kindly but forcefully ushered them out of the room. Great first impressions of the staff. Before we arrived we thought we could eat in the local area and booked b+b. We were advised on our arrival to avoid restaurants as we could get very sick eating at local restaurants. We then enquired at the reception to upgrade to all inclusive package and we would pay the extra supplement, my goodness that was a struggle. The person that could do this wasn't in that evening but we could see the reception staff writing notes of our conversation. We then came the following day to talk to the reception staff and they had no idea what we were talking about even though we gave them our room number and told them someone wrote this down - so we had to speak to them again upgrading. Finally we told we had to speak to someone else later that day and again repeat the conversation. The hotel scenery is great but they should protect their customers from locals calling out and trying to sell scarves , excursions and produce. You could be on a sun bed and you hear ' hello hello'. Going to the beach just in front of the hotel is the worst because it's a public beach. I actually was chased down by a local trying to sell something to me. It's sad you have to be rude for them to get the message that you're not interested in a overpriced excursion. The beach area in front of the hotel should be private as I felt so unsafe. Finally if you prefer drinks from behind the bar at the hotel expect a 15 minute wait time. There could be 5 people behind the bar a few customers in front of the bar but the wait time will still be 15 minutes on average The Heritance Ahungalla management should realise great customer service is key to the hotel market. Not only smiling staff member ( which they were) but those that go the extra mile. Whether it was one person from reception contacting us after the upgrade conversation and not us trying to speak to a relevant staff member eveytime we walked pass reception.",positive
"Hotel ambiance itself was very relaxing. The check in process was taking bit of a time, but that was not much of a problem as we had time to lool around the property. I would say that the staff were not too open to help. They mostly replied with a negative sense. The buffet spread was amazing. They have a separate vegetarian corner that is easy to figure out. Nothing to be blamed of the taste.It was amazing. The main pool is a bit too opened to the lobby. The second pool is lovely. The highlight is the warm water jacuzzi that is there near the pool. The rooms were too clustered and badly need refurbishment. In one of the rooms we had the lock was broken. The water pressure in the shower was too much. Lastly I would say that the guests must have their freedom to review the hotel after their stay. I feel it is very wrong to force a review. May be they can suggest to leave a review on tripadvisor, but it is not required for the staff to download it on the guest's phone and wait till the review is posted. If this happens please get a moment off and tell them you will go back and post a review.",neutral

"I'm from Kandy. We (myself and my wife) went to Kandalama in dabulla and had a great time So we wanted to take our parents as well. It's pointless of going to the same place (Kandalama) twice therefore we decided to go to ahungama heritance since it's all from the same family. There's about 220km from kandy (up and down both about 450-500Km) it was along trip. by the time we got to the hotel it was 5.00pm on 05/12/2015. We told the reception we have 2 bookings, one double room and one triple room. The welcoming lady was a fat girl and she was very rude to us she did not support at all even when filling the forms during the check in. and she took us to our rooms Double room (215)was ok but the triple room was very small (216) and fully packed most of all there were only 2 beds, so when i inquire about the 3rd bed from that girl we said "" Ah.... ok i will send a folding bed for you"" As if like we are servants/slaves. I told her politely. I request for a triple room and I have already done the payment by visiting to your headoffice at aitken spence colombo. Her reply was ""all our rooms are this size there is nothing we can do"" I said if you put another folding bed here, there is no space even to walk in this room. Her reply was ""Sorry"" she said it in a way either you take the room or go home, and she went away saying she will send someone with the folding bed. My mother said ""don't be mad putha we all came here to enjoy not to fight the other room(215) seems to be a bit large so we shifted to the next room. Then again I thought I already paid for a triple room and I don't get the service I wanted. If the hotel has only double rooms, they should have told me when booking. they never told me that. I got mad. I called the reception and requested to connect with the manager. Unfortunately manager was not there and an executive officer was available named ""Chathuranga"" I told him about my situation. I have child about 10 months old. Myself mywife my child and my mother all are staying at this room, and the room is too small. he quietly listened to my situation and he asked me 5 mins and call back. then he called me and say ""sir we have a large room vacant you can shift to that room"" I was delighted we all went there to enjoy not to suffer and stay in a room like in a prison cell. Then again I called to chathuranga and appologised him for getting mad and raising my voice what he told me shocking. he told me ""sir it's better you told me now rather than checking out, if so we couldn't have done anything for you.",negative

"I visited this property for a destination family wedding and while the rooms, all beach facing and the property was great with the really nice swimming pools, the service levels expected for this category of hotel was severely lacking. We were 3 of us staying in a suite and we were categorically declined to be given another cinamon gel soap (they only give one for your entire stay) and we had to fight for extra drinking water, considering there was an extra person in the room. We had a housekeeping guy who was downright rude and hellbent on proving us wrong. Apart from this even refusal for giving us food from the buffet since we were late or allowing us to sit in the restaurant and eat. The point is that the staff blindly followed rules and did not care about customer service at all. Not once have they gone out of their way to help us feel comfortable.",negative
"A friend and I stayed at this property for 4 days. It was absolutely wonderful, from the property and its location, to the rooms, facilities and the beach. The staff were amazing, went out of their way on every front from the house keeping staff, to the waiters, front desk, restaurant managers and the GM of the hotel, who is always available to meet all guests on the property. Their service was 5 star and definitely the best hotel in Sri Lanka by a mile. Highly recommend to those looking to celebrate an occasion, travel as a family, couples or group of friends.",positive

It has been a beautiful stay. We were greeted by the reception staff who were very welcoming. We arrived at 8 am and they were very understanding that we had a long flight and ride from the airport and offered us an early checkin upon arrival. We were greeters by fresh cold towels and fresh juice. The room was nice as well. The shower is very nice and hot water is always available. The room service is quick and laundry can be done within a short period of time compared to other places. The beach is amazing and very relaxing. The hotel is relatively close to Galle as well. The staff were always very friendly. We had a trip to Kandy on one of the days and the hotel arranged a to go breakfast for us that was ready for us at 5 am. They also provide wake up calls. I would suggest to get a room with a sea view to benefit the most. The hotel can help you to arrange everything as well. The shampoo and shower gel provided by the hotel had a very nice smell as well. There are two pools amazingly located within the property. We loved that we swam under the rain as well. The beach is very clean and had an amazing view. We had an amazing time especially with the traditional night in the hotel where we saw the traditional show and dance. You won't regret visiting and I would love to visit again. It is a romantic place but also very suitable for families and friends. You can find international food in the restaurant as well. At night the view of the fishermen boats in the distance was so beautiful as well. It is a beautiful safe hotel with amazing staff who will not hesitate to assist the guest. Thank you for the lovely stay.,positive
The hotel is very nice and calm . They have a great service and friendly stuff. Recommended for travellers who want a peaceful and calm trip to relax at the beach and enjoy the beautiful nature of Srilanka.,positive

"My first impression as I drove into the driveway and into reception was quite good....then downhill.I picked the hotel as it was ranked a 5 star property,but by European I would give it a low 3.....I was in a luxury room...half the lights did not work,a damp smell lingered despite spraying,the room was old dated the shower over spilled and the water was not warm....I have to say the worst room I have slept in.The public areas and dinning room pool area also very dated.I was informed the hotel was closing in May 2016 for a full re fit....avoid until then....The staff need service training ...I found them lacking direction ....overall totally disappointed.",negative

I don't want this stay to end! Will definitely visit again soon!",positive
"We had previously stayed at this resort in 2011 and naturally, happy with the service the first time, we came back. I am glad to say that the service has not only simply stayed the same but improved. The service staff are friendly and very hospitable and are always willing to help. But I thought that the buffet service was fantastic and there was a variety of foods guaranteed to satisfy all tastes and preferences. The rooms were beautiful and had a desirable Earthy quality which perfectly matched the traditional service and atmosphere exuded by the hotel. Very relaxing. Overall a wonderful place that I would highly recommend for all looking for a comfortable and pleasing stay in Sri Lanka. Certainly looking forward to returning here and experiencing the Heritance Ahungalla magic again!!! Neil Jayasuriya And Family",positive

"This is our second time here, the staff are consistent in their courteous costumer service. Location & view brilliant. I thought the 0.97m pool was ideal for families with little kids like mine. Very safe and lot of fun (there is a separate deep pool, a second pool and even a jacuzzi if you like) Food. Wow. My wife loves the baked cheese cake which is possibly the best in SL. Facilities. Its endless. We thoroughly enjoyed the games room. But the best part for me still is the staff. Friendly & constantly checking whether we are ok and enjoying. Specially wish to note Anushkaa from the restaurant who was so nice to us and was so good in looking after the little children which was a homely touch of hospitality. Much appreciated. Supuni at reception also served us very well. Brilliant ! Thanks. Weak point :- the Google maps/navigation didn't tag the hotel properly. It lead us up a wrong road (since we travelling at night)we were mislead by it.",positive
"Property : Beautiful architecture, bright outdoor spaces and two amazing swimming pools and a useless beach. Rooms: Needs an upgrade to the really bad lighting system. Rooms are very dark and not at all child friendly. Beds are comfy n pillows are great. Room cleanliness is not all satisfied. Cigarette hash underneath the bed looks as if it had not been cleaned for ages. Food: The Salads are not at all up to the standard. Soup was a good start. Main course buffet was a bit messed up. Potatoes burnt while the cuttle fish left raw n the crabs too sweet n also uncooked for dinner. Lunch was way better. The positive point is that the staff after informing made us an ala carte dish of crabs and prawns and it was amazing. Desert was spot on delicious. Variety was also another plus point. Staff: The happy smiling faces and welcoming gestures by the overall staff make you want to come back again to this property. Thanks to Mr Thushara the Food manager and the head Chef and also all the other staff for making our stay a pleasant one. We look forward to coming back to heritance Ahungalla with a better expectation. Imran Hinghora",neutral

Located not too far from Colombo and gives you a great view of the beach from the get go. The hotel itself is very nice with a spacious pool facing the beach. The food had a lot of variety and were nicely prepared and well presented. The staff were polite and accommodating. Had a great overall experience throughout the day and would be back again for a longer stay for sure. Highly recommended for a beachfront getaway within only a couple of hours drive from Colombo!,positive

"Fantastic Experience right from the time you drive in, to when you are greeted by the staff to when you are taken to your room and when you get to see the breathtaking view of the ocean. Simply outstanding. The place is designed very well by renowned architect Geoffrey Bawa, blending the outside with the inside elements. Really brings in a whole of freshness. To top it all, the staff are very warm, friendly and helpful. A really hospitable team who make it a point to personalise their connect with the guest. Instantly makes you feel at home. I am glad this is my first place of stay in Sri Lanka, as it has made it a lasting memory. However, it has definitely raised the bar high for what is to come next. This place is a must experience.",positive

Pool is great but the wide access to the beach is more enoyable. Enjoying the sea view from the balcony. Dont miss it.",positive
We had an awesome time with our Friends. Best things about this hotel is the nice pool. Food was average. Received an excellent service from the entire staff. I would recommend this hotel for a nice relaxing stay.,positive
I entered the hotel with a lot of hesitation....wasn't sure what to expect especially since I was confident that the photographs on the web were like most hotels an exaggeration...playing with the lights and angles. But was pleasantly surprised. The hotel is nothing fancy it is simple with polite and forever smiling staff. In fact since we had booked on line for sea facing room...but our confirmation did not mention anything so I had called them in advance requesting for sea facing room ... When we reached the hotel not one question or excuse given ... only request was to wait till rooms got ready as we were early. The staff at the restaurants were extremely nice and pampered you like you were the only one there...but be careful of what you're eating...one of the days they offered us some snacks at the bar ... But the snacks were infested with red ants they had to change the snacks three times before we were given non red ant / non infested snacks. Now to the room....they were brilliant...big comfortable rooms with equally big balcony and for view we had the trees / pool beach and the unending Indian Ocean...loved the view .... This hotel would get 5 stars only for its view. ... The ants ate away a star. We had shortlisted the heritance and jet wings light house ...am so happy we picked this one...totally worth it. Thank you for the super hospitality. Highly recommended.,positive
It was great to be back at my favorite beach resort Heritance Ahungalla with my family members. Very relaxing and comfortable stay.

We have visited to the Heritance Ahungalla on Sunday afternoon with my family. We have reserved 3 dbl rooms for a night. We had a chance to get a room with sea view. Room was very comfortable & they have provided tea/coffee making facilities at the room. Other than that there was a mini bar in the room as well. Food was AWSOME & had lot of varieties in all menues. Staff was really HELPFUL & FRIENDLY. free wi-fi available through out the hotel where as we didn't had that opportunity in other hotels we visited. This was our BEST Resort experience in down south. Simply Excellent Property with LOVELY team... Highly recommended for others to have a visit in your life time.,positive

The Management and Staff were excellent and they went out of their way to ensure that everything was perfect for us. We had every need taken care of and more. Having been in other resorts around the world this was easily our very best experience and i wouldn't hesitate to recommend and go back there anytime i visit Sri-Lanka. Well done guys. The meals, and accommodation at top notch, you'd be hard pressed to find another resort that offers so much value and service, not only is it beautiful to look at but the people are genuine and we had an awesome time.",positive

"Words fall short in describing this huge property ,an awesome stay at this hotel made my trip to SriLanka. The hotel is set on a beautiful private beach and a lovely swimming pool by the beach makes a stay here irresistible. The staff is very polite,hardworking ,the room service is slightly slow but the food service is the best here. Variety of restaurants here,the breakfast menu list is exhaustive and the quality of food is superb. The Indian veg menu is very good comparing with the Srilankan Standards. Has various facilities-Badminton,tabletennis,Billiards ,Carrom,Spa and what not. The room lighting can be dull here but the room and balcony view of the beach is the best!

"My friend and I stayed at this hotel for the last 4 days of our sri lankan tour. We stopped off at the turtle sanctuary beforehand which was very cute (15 mins ish from hotel) we had a lovely greeting at the hotel- staff very pleasant. Our room was sweet, we got a complimentary upgrade. Spacious room, lovely sea view. Room a little old, could do with a bit of a spruce up. Poolside and beach were very quiet, got a sun bed every day. The ""beach boys"" were quite annoying and pushy but on the last day we bought something from the ladies and gave them some of our stuff, they are poor so appreciated it. Weather in late April Was ok, very very very hot, slightly cloudy, a little rain. Beach was beautiful but didn't venture into the rough sea. Stayed on the hotel complex as it's a little out. Food was ok, nothing special but staff really helpful. 4 days was perfect wouldn't do anymore. All in all a lovely stay just could do with an update.",neutral

"Big buffet but flies on table and crawling crabs under tablecloths in airconditioned dining room. The tiles in the shower area had never been cleaned. Dull resort as very little to do beside swim in their pool. The beach is unsafe, no water sports. Only one table tennis table and one carrom board. Very warm and friendly staff but housekeeping and reception leave much to be desired. Not worth the price.Ground floor rooms are dark and dingy with blinds that need a tug of war to open and close.",negative

At night there is a live music by a man with a saxaphone and it was truly a novel experience. I loved every bit of my stay and I would recommend it to anyone who is seeking a peaceful escape.,positive
"We visited this hotael for one week after doing safaris just to relax. I must say its been one of the stays that gave me very mixed feelings at the beginning. The hotel looks quote nice and delivered excellent quality in foods, the rooms are clean. Even though the hotel puts a lot of effort in pest control we had a bug problem in our room on the first day. After mentioning this our room was gladly upgraded and the previous room closed for very thorough treatment. It is always possible to have something like this when traveling to tropic countries. But we didn't experience any more problems after that. The hotel more then compensated our discomfort and that says a lot about how they want you to feel after your visit. If you're afraid of bugs its always better to get a room on higher floors. The food was of good quality, also the drinks. The main dining area didn't feel very cosy to us but this is easily solved by eating outside in the garden. Also try the vegetable pati for snack, its awesome. The chef showed us around the kitchen (we made mention something was labeled as vegetarian which contained fish) but they took this small mistake (we saw it before eating) very serious. They showed us around in the kitchen which also was very clean and they also have a small atelier where the do food / sugar sculpting of which they won many international awards. It's a shame they didn't give this more attention in the hotel. The garden has nice areas to sit but we were confronted with another pest the hotel was working very hard to control, local sales men. The beach is public and the sales men bite hard and don't let go. For us this proved to be very irritating since they sometimes became really aggressive (I almost got in a fight with one of them after I didn't agree on a price he started calling me out, even when I was further on the hotel grounds). A mention to management about this and since then we saw police patroling the beach. Notice that you'll have this problem at any hotel because all beaches are public. This hotel at least tries very hard not to let this be a negative factor for their guests. So in short the hotel is good with the potential to become awesome. There are a lot smaller details (as everywhere) they can still improve on, but never have I been to a hotel that was so eager to get feedback from their guests and implement it. Just make sure to talk to them if something is bothering you and they will be very grateful and make sure you walk out with a good experience. Don't just put it on TripAdvisor after you go. Maybe we had a bit of Murphy at our side during our stay but the hotel and very friendly crew and management went out of their way to make our stay memorable and they did in spades!",positive
"Checked in for staying the night. The staff were very courteous and helpful. Rooms are well furnished especially luxury suite with a Jacuzzi ( there was a trouble using it because of a technical failure nevertheless) and tv area with comfy sofas.

We were a group of 10 who visited this Hotel in Bentota. We stayed here for 2 days... Though the hotel is a little old and we had issues with our electrical plugs in our room not working. Overall we were very Happy with our stay here..... Almost all the rooms are facing the sea......,positive
"We were in bentota for a night and we'd chosen this resort for our stay.. my my... what a room and what a view!!!it open onto the pool and directly into the sea... you actually feel serene and peaceful and just don't feel like doing anything else but laze on the beach!!! Too bad that we stayed only for a day!!! If every person stays there for at least 3 to 4 days, I'm sure that stress won't exist in life anymore!!!",positive
Very hospitable. Super service. Keep it up. Hoping to come back very soon. Very comfortable rooms. Keep it up.food is very delicous and the breakfast and the desserts was outstanding .....atmosphere and the environment is breath takingly beautiful.....will definitly come to this hotel again.....the conference was held perfectly well toooo....the staff is very friendly and courtious....,positive
Had a nice time.warm welcome and friendly hospitality....the rooms are in condition .... the food is delcious and there is kore variety and we loved the main dishes....the atmosphere and the environment is nature friendly.....the conference was also good ...good place to carryout a conference....will come back to this hotel again...,positive
"The first thing that hits you is the chaos that reigns at the reception. It takes 30 mins to check us in . We were desperate for lunch.So at 2.30 the coffee shop seemed like a good option. But instead of quick service we were greeted by rude staff and poor service. The rice n curry we ordered was cold. Took them 25 mins to serve cold food. They did try n make up for it at their main restaurant. We were told ""you just name it and we will make it"". The buffet spread is vast.Vegetarian dishes they are yet to master.what they cook up as Indian fare falls woefully short.A quick rethink is needed here. Being a resort by the sea side, Heritance could have been exciting but alas the only thing that they provide is the sea! No water sports.No beach based activity. The staff is overworked. Its a mela out there. Bentota could be a better option with many hotels and resorts to choose from.Also it is the hub for water sports.",negative
"Heritance Ahungalla would be a great location for a couples retreat, provided they make a few improvements. The hotel is situated in a slightly secluded area (15-20 minutes away from Galle city), is a heart-warming relic of colonial era architecture, and has a marvelous private beach and other relevant amenities. However, it can become even better if the service quality is improved. I had a bitter experience checking in as I waited for almost half an hour before anyone attended me, and even then it took the staff forever to complete the formalities. One would generally expect the staff of a 5-star hotel to be more competent and efficient. Moreover, the staff seemed confused when I asked them for advice on travelling around Galle. I stayed in a twin sharing room (I was there on a conference). While the room was nice, the bathroom seemed a little worn down and I felt needed to be revamped.",neutral
Heritance ahungalla is one of best beach hotels in sri lanka where you can relax and enjoy your holiday. Food is really nice with lots of selections..... staff is very friendly and willing to help always.... our room was 203 and it has a nice view..when you go to the balcony you can sea the beautiful and clean beach........... Thank you.,positive

It was a wonderful experience for us at the resort. I had been there for the yearly family holiday and must say it was worth it. The staff was extremely hospitable. The vegetarian Indian food at the Coffee shop was indeed lip smacking. It is indeed a very well maintained property and I would recommend it to everyone who is planning at trip to Bentota !,positive
We booked the property by reference of someone who stayed at this property before and we absolutely loved the place! The property is right on the beach and we can see the ocean right from the hotel lobby. All the rooms overlook the sea and have a stunning view. Food was absolutely delicious and there is plenty of things to do on the resort itself.,positive
The hotel is laid out beautifully and at a beautiful location. The rooms are nice with a nice view but the rooms need more light. The services are prompt . the food is also good .but the service could be faster. Overall the atmosphere is very nice and the stay was enjoyable.,positive
Hotel which is beach facing....😄 Gives Pleasure; The Hotel is most enjoyable with family and friends. Doing Beach Photography was awesome. The Rooms are very spacious with Free Wifi all around the hotel.😇 Tv ma jarmariya bov aave che krupiya Tata Sky nakho.😜😂,positive
My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights at the end of our honeymoon and had a very nice time. We were in a corner room on the 2nd floor and have no big complaints. The staff were very friendly and made a real effort with us as they knew it was our honeymoon. The general decor of the hotel could do with being refreshed and the food was good but not great. I'd be happy to recommend the hotel but I wouldn't class it as luxury.,neutral

"We spent 2 nights at the heritance ahungalla and we had a wonderful stay. Beginning with the heartwarming welcome to the beautiful clean definite 5 star worth room with a nice view on the ""blue pool area"" it all turned out to be even much more beautiful than we expected. Beds: comfortable, clean, large enough to get a nice sleep Room: deluxe room with balcony nice and clean Bathroom: djungle shower!! :) very modern and all in top quality Room service: very helpful, fast and accurate Pool: perfectly temperature and clean The best at the end: The food: what a big choice, changing daily, fresh fruits, several different meals in best quality, rich in diversity, grilled seafood, fresh fish, curries .... See for yourself - we loved it and already miss it !!!!! If we ever return to Sri Lanka, we stay here again Martin/Christina from Munich Nov 2015 Ps: written in English so that anybody can read it ;)",positive
This is the one of the best hotels I have visited recently... the food here is very delicious and has variety of food and i loved mainly the sri lanka food ...the taste is truly authentic and of very high standards and I have to thank the chefs of this hotel a lot the service and the staff is also excellent...the rooms are also good ..I recommend this hotelbti everyone...,positive
"loved our stay here... we had a perfect relaxing family vacation thanks to hesitance.. just didn't want to leave the property!! we arrived little late in the night and ordered burgers for everyone.. the hotel was generous enough by not charging us for the meals,since we had opted for buffet dinner in our bookings... it was sweet of them to do that!! must try is the colorado bulldog cocktail in the ac bar (i think it is called bacchus bar..not sure)..!! no frills in decor.. but great ambience to chat and sip your alcohol ;) the breakfast has a HUGE variety of live preparations option.. if u are a non veggie, then its like heaven.. but despite being vegetarian, i enjoyed the fruits, the dosai, the breads and muffins... would request them to add something more indian veg in their menu.. the swimming pool is HUGE and beautiful... the hotel boasts of 2 pools.. the spa personnel were very sweet to help us with our queries... the rooms are huge, bed quality is excellent.. the bathroom is decent.. however, i wish their toiletries were better. they were a major disappointment. The library is the far more organised and beautiful set up i have come across.. if u want to read in peace, this is it!! the beach is at your footstep... neat beach... my family had a super time!! cultural evenings are organised on weekends and its a nice experience.. we found many foreigners in the hotel and ended up being friends with few...!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for chilling your brains... time away from work/stress and rejuvenating yourself... it is a 2 and half drive from the colombo airport.. you are indulge in mangrove river safari and water sports nearby... bentota is just 20 min away.. enjoy!!",positive
"It is a good beach front property but it needs renovation rooms are quite old furniture is old and there is a particular wet Smell from the rooms that comes all the time,though plus points are that staff is courteous and is always ready to help food is good with a huge spread and very nice swimming pools with a jacuzzi as well.overall a very ok experience for the price paid.",neutral

We had a suite overlooking the Green pool which was really nice and quiet. It is a good place to relax with beautiful surroundings and very nice beach. The room was clean but needs updating. The food was average but they had quite a variety at breakfast. We really enjoyed our night swim in the pool.

"It was our third stay at the hotel. We travel quite frequently and stayed in 10-15 different hotels around Hikkaduwa, Benotota, Mirissa areas so far. I choose the hotel mainly because I knew what to expect and also did not want to disappoint guests who accompanied us during the visit. A good 4 star hotel with a good (not excellent) 4 star service this time around as well. Few suggestions that could further improve overall experience and ambiance/ We opted for a half board and where pretty happy with the spread and choices offered during the breakfast as well as dinner. Some dishes where quite good while others not that tasty. For example: morning porridge as well as a dinner soup where on a cold side. It looked like that the overall cleanness of rooms and hotel grounds (like last time, curtains where stained in the rooms; some trash scattered around till noon time and seeing hotel staff passing by and simply ignoring piece of dirty paper on the floor was quite annoying) were not on hotel's priority list. Not that bothersome but still somewhat uncomfortable smell in the main dining hall. It’s the “small” details that could be improved with such a little effort and make overall experience so much more pleasant and comfortable.",positive
The environment and the location and the surrounding is very beautiful and attractive.... The rooms are very comfortable and clean.... The food was excellent and there were many dishes the soup and the dessert was great.....the pools was big and beautiful... Will definitely come to this hotel again,positive

Pool was stunning, comfortable loungers and beach on your door step. An amazing hotel and would highly recommend staying, close to the turtle sanctuary, spice garden and other attractions.",positive
"A lovely place to unwind and relax after a busy visit to Sri Lanka. All the staff are extremely friendly and willing to help whenever we need them.

"A very warm, welcoming, beautiful resort. Our family spent 6 nights at the Heritance and will more than likely book again for the location and price. We booked online for a suite at a really good rate. As there was no way to book a luxury suite, we were hoping to be upgraded at checkin. As we are a large family, the benefit of the luxury suites 2 bathrooms would have been great. Unfortunately there were no luxury suites available when we arrived. Our room was clean and comfortable. We did notice the shower/bath combo would not drain properly and also collected a lot of water on the tubs edges which would spill onto the floor. We made do with towels placed in strategic locations. The food was very good and we absolutely loved the huge swimming pool. We even swam during a thunder shower. The location served as a great base to see all of the other sites Sri Lanka had to offer. Every staff member from the waiters, to the lifeguards, to the lovely gift shop employee was fantastic. Our kids were treated to a magic show, played pool and foosball, and loved the way our towels were folded into different animals upon arriving back to our room each night. Great stay!",positive
Excellent service and great hospitality you provided all the way..... thank you do much for giving nice rooms with a lovely view. We feel like home away from home.. food was fantastic.... we will recommend...,positive
We were there on the 23rd October and when we're having bf in between of our bf we were asked to get up because the place was reserved for a foreigner. Then we asked a glass of water and the hostess denied that too. Her name was anuskha. When asked her for apologies she dint even do that . So I warn some indians going there no proper bf dinner also available for indians . No action was taken after I complained the management too.,negative

"I have visited this hotel with my family & my staff. I'm giving this rating, strictly for the superb service offered by the HERITANCE STAFF. I was truly stunned of the QUALITY OF SERVICE. Mr. LAKMAL @ the main restaurant offered an OUTSTANDING SERVICE, not only for us but also for all the people who dined at the Restaurant. He is a DIAMOND for the hotel. He was everywhere satisfying the customers. He has offered a personalised service for everyone. It's like having a personal Butler. Mr. Praveen also did a good job. Mr. CHAMILA who worked for the Dinner Service on 23rd October'15 & Breakfast Service on 24th was absolutely fantastic. He was working really hard to satisfy the customers. Miss.MADHUBHASHINI & Miss.ANUSHKA were SUPERB.Though They were working tirelessly to satisfy the customers they were full of Smiles. That's a Wonderful quality I really appriciate. Me, my family & my staff have thoroughly enjoyed some tasty Hoppers which were made by Ms.RANJANI & Ms.CHANDRANI. They were handling the Uppers counter effortlessly. HOPPERS were the ONLY FOOD I've enjoyed here. Overall food were NOT SATISFYING & NOT UP TO THE STANDARD. Room which I've stayed with my family, Room No.345 was badly needing a refurbishment as well as the whole hotel. The TV was not working properly. Actually the lodging also was not up to the standards. Though we made the booking before almost TEN MONTHS ago & clearly mentioned about the kids we are having, they offered me a room far far away from the main restaurant. I was told that room was really good & promising, but it WAS NOT. Truly I wouldn't be thinking of coming here again. But I hope the SERVICE the staff offered will make a difference in my mind. Mr. LAKMAL Mr. CHAMILA Mr. PRAVEEN Miss.MADHUBHASHINI Miss. ANUSHKA Ms. CHANDRANI Ms. RANJANI Thank You All for your Kind, Graceful, Helpful & OUTSTANDING SERVICE!!!",positive

"This is one of exciting experience had out of all my trips I had so far .... Amazing staff support . We also had a friend and his family with us in this trip in fact they have just visited US just before this visit . This resort and the service of the staff could excite them like any thing. The staff are supportive to the extend that we have missed out our camera cover some where and forgot about that , but they came to us and said we have missed it out and asked us to pick from the reception. The food is another reason why should visit again to this restaurant. Specifically one Ms.Shanika among the staff supported us out of her way and we recommend this hotel to everyone without any hesitation and this is a real memorable experience in our trips.",positive

"We arrived here nearly a week ago to torrential rain. This is the end of the monsoon season in this part of the island. First impressions of the hotel were lovely. The staff are what makes this hotel a pleasure to stay in. We were shown to our room which was a little dated but clean and cool. The rain Showers in the room are great and the shower gel smells of a tropical fruit sensation. Food here is amazing. The head chef Manjua runs a great team of chefs who are more than happy to cook you what you like if what's on offer isn't to your taste. They sure know how to make curries here. You must try every single one as they are divine. Our ever expanding waistlines are proof of this. There is plenty more on offer if curries are not your thing. A myriad of fresh fruit is available and bananas taste amazing, nothing like what we eat at home. The weather was good most days. Towards the early evening rain clouds gather and a heavy downpour follows. Perfect time for a G&T at the pool bar. Sunsets are incredible and worth waiting around to see. The beach is vast and deserted. Just a few hotel guests walking along taking in it beauty. There are however beach guys who nag the pants off you to sell you sightseeing trips. Be aware they usually don't have insurance so best to book with a reputable company. They are harmless just a few no thank you and they get the message. There are a group of ladies who sell sarongs and trinkets on the beach they are lovely and friendly, don't forget to barter here, start low and then usually meet in the middle. Be careful of the sun you burn very quickly and don't forget mozzie repellant and bite cream. We used a guide for our trips LASI TOURS LASI was great and drove safely through the traffic which is another world in itself. He is very knowledgable and will arrange bespoke tours according to your needs. Sri Lanka is beautiful. Made even more special by its people. The temples, turtle sanctuaries, elephant retreats are fab. Unfortunately we didn't have enough time to see everything so a revisit will be on the cards. I hope you find this review of interest",positive
i was with my wife in this hotel from 12/10 to 18/10 it was the best hotel i visit before ..very good service very friendly staff ...the food is good especially the sea food..just if you want go to this hotel need chose the best time for good weather ..i hope i will visit heritance ahungalla again we will miss this tme,positive
"Gorgeous hotel in the perfect location on the beach. It's in its own complex which gives the perfect amount of privacy, exactly what we were looking for after travelling around Sri Lanka. They presented us with a chocolate cake for my partners birthday, such a lovely gift. The staff are very helpful and the food is delicious. Hope to return again soon.",positive
"We have loved our time so far at Heritance, the staff are lovely and the hotel is equipped with everything you need for a great stay. Situated right on the beach makes for a beautiful setting, we are staying for 4 nights and would highly recommend longer.",positive
"A new experience, extraordinary and a classy hotel I'd say. The service staff is very good and kind...... The rooms Service is good and friendly.....

"Great place to stay with the best hospitality you could ever receive. The staff were friendly and were willing to go beyond their call of duty to serve customers. Excellent amenities which includes a clean pool, a pool side bar, gym and extra activities such as beach volleyball, tennis and cycling. Our room had a balcony facing the beach so we were able to enjoy the sun rise in the mornings. We celebrated two birthdays during our stay. The hotel staff arranged a cake within a very short notice and delivered it on time. I would really recommend this place for the warm and pleasant hospitality.",positive

"Must try Chef Manjula's seafood platter and executive Pravin's hospitality ,kindness and efficiency.. Srilanka hospitality at its best!!!!!! Two beautiful swimming pools one feels like it's an extension of the sea. The architecture is Jeffrey Bawa's and it's sprawling without giving a concrete look. nature had been unhindered.",positive
Lovely hotel designed by Geoffry Bawa. With beautiful spacious rooms. The hotel staff are friendly and are always around to help with a smile. The food is splendid and up to international standards. The hotel staff work tirelessly until your requests or suggestions are met and you get a very personalised memorable experience with your stay. Will visit this hotel again.,positive

Food was good and front desk was very helpful. Good follow up on any matters discussed at the time of checking in,positive
"We are glad that we selected ""Heritance Ahungalla"" for our honeymoon stay.. We arrived a bit late, but the staff at reception was very helpful. The gentleman who checked us in understood our tiredness as we were exhausted after an eventful day. We were offered with nice cool fruit juice as we were filling the check-in forms. As requested, they offered us a nice room with a clear view of the sea. We were given wifi access immediately and internet was fast and stable. Staff at the restaurant was very friendly and energized to serve us, regardless we were the last to enter the restaurant for the dinner. Because we were very tired, we were the last to leave the restaurant after breakfast and lunch as well, but I can clear say that either you come first or last you will be greeted and treated with same fresh smiles and same very friendly manner. Also, we were kindly informed that they will be closing the buffet soon and if we were like to be served anything else before they do so. Really appreciate that. As we were on honeymoon, we were suprized with nice decorated cake before the breakfast. Thank you very much for that... The pool is the main attraction of this marverllous hotel, the large pool near the beach is a place that you can never get enough of.. Finally, the check-out process was fast and easy without waiting for anything.. We were gifted with bottles of water for our journey in a nice little bag made from 100% recyced items.. Looking forward to visit again...",positive
"*Nice and warm welcome to the hotel. Beautiful vieuw from the hotel lobby. *Our room whas on the ground floor with a nice terrace to sit outside. (Thanks to the gardner for the fresh flowers! *Room whas spacious and cleen, with comfortable beds and pillows. *the bathroom was nice with a good hairdryer and nice complementary soaps and such. Every day fresh towels and around 17u a new round of towels if you neededthem. *one downside to the rooms was the lightning.. it was a bit too dark. the pools where nice and refreshing. enough sunbeds for everybody with dry towels if you need them. *the beach whas nice with a stunning view. Unfortunately, the beach was often washed up with trash. *and also some lokals that were trying to sell some sun dresses. Thats fine by me, but they keep on calling you ""madame madame"". You have to be a bit harsh and say NO otherwise they keep on calling you. Hotel Security is strict and chase rhem when they get too pushy. When you have a sunbed against the pool you are fine. *The breakfast, lunch and dinner where so good. Everyday different and fresh choices. Also try their upper room dining! That was just excellent! (Not included in the all in package) we whould recommend this hotel to everybody! * be aware of the squirrels, they are verry friendly but they ate through my man's shirt to find some nuts in our bag 😁! *****",positive
Beautiful hotel we had a woderful time in time .The hotel is perfect. Only one suggestion If u can include Indian Menu it will be great. The rooms are awasome especially with sea facing and pool facing.,positive
"We stayed her for 11 nights at the end of September to celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary and this was our third stay here. We were married here (when it was Triton) in 2000. The staff are extremely friendly and really do want to make sure every aspect of your stay is perfect. I’ve read some of the reviews about the food which seem overly critical but there is something for everyone. There are chefs on duty during breakfast, lunch and dinner and if you can’t find something to suit your palate from the varied selection on offer – just ask they would be more than happy to make arrangements for you. We were very well looked after from the moment we arrived. We had made a specific room request which was met and we weren’t disappointed. We had a suite overlooking the Green (residents) pool which in our opinion is the quieter end of the hotel and this was important to us. The room was extremely comfortable, very clean and maintained twice a day (including turn down service) so fresh towels, water and anything you need is never too far away. I love the creations that the room staff make of towels and fresh flowers. During our stay we received a complimentary dinner in the fine dining restaurant. The chef on duty was TSM deSilva and it was an incredible culinary experience. All aspects of the meal were well flavoured and presented with such care. It was obvious to us that Chef de Silva has a passion for creating amazing flavours and he was keen to receive feedback on the dishes he creates and he chatted with us to make sure we were happy with all aspects of the fine dining experience. We enjoyed it so much we went back again during our stay and we weren’t disappointed. The second meal was as incredible as the first. They have a lot of talented staff here at Heritance and together they make a great team. We were lucky enough to be given a tour of the kitchens and the Chocolate factory which was absolutely mind boggling. The creations they create have to be seen to be believed. Keep up the good work and please don’t change too much of what makes this hotel a special place when you close for your next refurbishment (which we understand is due in 2016). The one thing I would say is if you are planning to stay here, all-inclusive does not include please and thank you to the staff. I was astonished at the attitude of some guests towards the staff – as I’ve already mentioned the staff want to make your stay the best it can be – saying please and thank to the staff does not cost you anything so remember to take your manners with you. Thank you to all the staff who looked after us so well. We can’t wait to return again.",positive
We came to spend the Sunday at heritance for a buffet and a swim. It was a beautiful experience as the staff were very friendly and helpful. Only drawback we came across is that there is no kids pool. Will surely come back again. Thank you for the awesome hospitality and pleasant experience.,positive

Best hospitality so far from a five start hotel. The staff is exceptional . The food is good can do better. The rooms and other facilities are all good. The architecture of this hotel is a key factor and creates that ambiance for a relaxed getaway for anyone .,positive
"We (6 of us) chose Heritance Ahungala for our day out. It was a great experience for us, the hospitality provided to us by Ms. Raneesha was fantastic . She was very kind and Very helpful. As for the food we think it can do better and the varieties was poor and refilling of the buffet items was slaw.",positive
"I came here with my family. I'm really satisfied with here service. They have organised special birthday cake for my wife's birthday. I speciali mention guys how help us kk,praveen and chef pujitha... We will come back soon!!!!!@",positive
"Wonderful warm property. Plenty to do with a family. We were two families with 4 kids ranging from 5 to 12 years of age. The rooms are a touch old and lack contemporary furnishings. However, what the rooms lack was more than made up by the staff, who are fabulous. Anything you need is available or will be catered for. Nuwan and Ranisha deserve a special mention. Nuwan is the restaurant manager and Ranisha is at the front desk. That said somewhat unfair to not cite the warmth and customer centric nature of the rest of the staff, which was just as good The game room was fun for an afternoon when we were caught in the rain, though the kids club really needs a make over! Take the suite if with a family. Big rooms and really comfortable. All in all, we would recommend the property.",positive
"Had a really nice time at our vacation in this hotel and i must say overall it was a really pleasent experience. Nice food and the staff was really helpfull in attending to the needs.if you are planing a vacation here, well ur money is worth spending. All the best to the hotel and keep growing the positive momentum! Cheers!",positive
Room was good however the television had to be changed 3 times. Food was avarage but a lot more room for improvement. Staff is the main reason for the guest to feel well come and happy during there stay. One of them in perticuler Ranisha very plesent and helpful. Night club was also avarage however the collection of music could have been and it was empty.,neutral
Beautiful hotel and wonderful ambience. The view is breathtaking and the architecture of Geoffrey Bawa is stunning as always. But the stand out feature was the great staff and service. Special mention must go to Ranisha who was so friendly and helpful. Thumbs up!,positive

We arrived here at 9:00 a.m and got the room within an hour irrespective of the 2:00 p.m checking standard. Rooms are clean and nice with a good AC system. In room dining service was a good option after the long trip. There are no places to go and eat outside the hotel but most of the guests take All inclusive here and for BB plan we went to hotel restaurants with clean, tasty and good service. The best things we liked here were the ocean, green scenery and friendly personnel at the hotel. Special thank you to Ranisha and Thusara!",positive
"It was a 'wow' experience from the start! When myself & my wife arrived at the hotel, we were greeted warmly by the hotel staff & given refreshments, & started on the buffet (we were pretty hungry!). The buffet lunch was AMAZING! The variety of food was nothing short of exquisite, & the ambiance was perfect for a newly married couple in the dining area. The variety of food consisted of delicacies such as duck among so many others, & the desserts were absolutely delicious too! Afterward, we went to the beach, & I must admit that the view is awesome! Would I recommend this hotel to others? WITHOUT A DOUBT! It's an amazing experience that will never be forgotten! The friendly hotel staff even took some awesome photos of me & my wife, & I must admit that I felt very impressed with the quality & personality of the staff! This is definitely worth a visit. To all newly weds: your visit here will be memorable & mesmerizing, I can promise you without any biase.",positive

"My wife and I, along with my brother and his family, spent two days at this wonderful hotel this week. The facility is very spacious and the layout is well planned out. The food is excellent with many options. The one aspect that immediately stuck out for me was how every staff member we encountered, from the doorman to room service to restaurant wait staff to the front desk, all were so very much in sync with providing the guests an outstanding experience. There was no difference in standard or attentiveness amongst any of the staff we encountered--each greeted us pleasantly, spoke politely and clearly, were well groomed and dressed and made the experience memorable. Credit should be given to management for the emphasis placed on training and for making superior the standard across the staff.",positive
"Having read great reviews of this hotel and noting its Sri Lankan 5 star rating we had high expectations. We were certainly not disappointed. It's impossible not to start a review of this hotel with the food which was simply superb and beautifully presented. Something for everyone, loads of local curries, (not for the feint hearted), wonderful oriental food and even plenty of options for those with European tastes. Every dish had its own unique flavour, the choice was endless and the quality of the meat, fish and seafood was exceptional. Our room, overlooking the resident's garden pool, as spacious and functional without being special, but the beds were very comfortable and the rain shower was ideal with endless hot water. There was also a wide balcony to sit out on and watch the world go by. Room service was spot on each day. The private resident's 'Green Pool' was one of the most beautiful I have seen with overhanging low trees to give you shade if required. The hotel's bar/cafe, where there was gentle live music each evening, was spread around the main pool with wonderful views of the beach and Indian Ocean. This area also included the imposing reception area, an additional A La Carte Restaurant, a rest room and Bistro type restaurant. Impressive trees, vines and other sub tropical plants grew within the hotel with holes in the ceiling to accommodate light and rain. All in all very peaceful and very relaxing. Finally the staff. We have found that all the hotels we have stayed in in Sri Lanka are made by the efficiency, helpfulness and friendliness of the staff. The Heritance was no exception. It has to be said that we did have an issue with the restaurant service early on, but our complaint was dealt with immediately and the service from then on was faultless. We would like to say a special thanks to Nelka and Jananjaya for looking after us so well. Yes, my wife and I certainly fell in love with this hotel.",positive
"Visited the hotel almost after 25 years(then Triton), it has been a great holiday at Heritance. The room was amazing. A must visit is the Tendulkar Suite. The service and the staff has been beyond expectations. The food has topped it all and just checked my weight and the scale in my room just proved it.😉 My kids who are usually fussy eaters were pampered by the staff and was given special treatment. Will be back soon. Thank you for a lovely holiday.",positive
The service was good specially by the senior staff Mr Pravin. The location on the well maintained clean sea beach is excellent.Good hotel for relaxing. Hotel needs some improvement in north Indian food.Overall its good hotel to stay......,positive

"Love the room, recreational activities above all the food..... The swimming pools were marvelous for my kid. The service of the restaurant is prompt and friendly.... Love the touch of Geoffrey Bawa... It's an amazing experiance",positive
"The biggest highlight during my 2 night stay was the exceptional service demonstrated by the staff especially those at the restaurant. Lakmal, Nuwan and Nelka were always around to serve and take care of our meals. They even went to the extent of asking if we wanted anything outside the buffet. The ice cream yet brought to the room was a nice touch! Given my toddler nephew (of less than 2yrs) was not in a position to enjoy the buffet, Lakmal and Nuwan approached us with their pragmatism of offering mashed up food for the baby. Quick thinking and awesome service once again. The two hick up's were in relation to the room #253 1. The door lock wasn't functioning efficiently as it should. 2. A ceiling leak left a puddle just outside the bathroom. Nonetheless Nihal came to the rescue and sorted it out quickly. All in all a very good 2 night stay. Cheers",positive
Heritance hotels has been my favourite hotels...stayed at Kandalama and now at Ahungalla. The rooms are very good and clean ...the food is delicious and had an excellent variety of choice .......the black and white show was very beautifully done by the animators ... the pools are large enjoyed the sea breeze ... we recommend this hotel to anyone who would like to enjoy the best in the southern coast of Sri Lanka...,positive
People truly look for an excuse for a getaway from the busy schedules they have to deal with every day. Looking for a place to have that relaxation and comfort can be a bit of a difficult task. For me Heritance Ahungalla is such a getaway. True relaxation at its best.

"Came with some friends for the day to relax and had a great time. Was surprised by the attentiveness of the staff. Food was good but not up to standard, and a wide selection was available. Rooms were tidy and spacious.",positive
"The atmosphere was relaxed and our every need was catered for. The variety and quality of the food were outstanding. We cannot speak highly enough of this amazing hotel. We took a two day tour to Kandy visiting a spice garden, tea factory and gem museum/shop on the way. Our hotel was good and the following day we spent time at the botanical gardens before visiting the elephant orphanage. We had nothing but kindness all the way. One evening after dinner the sous chef Roshan Pujitha showed us round the kitchens where he explained about the number of meals that were prepared each day. We were also shown some amazing sculptures made from salt dough, butter and chocolate. We shall tell all our friends about this hotel!",positive

We are counting down the days!,positive
"Had gone with my family and had two rooms. Heritance is a hotel which grows on you. Everything......food, service, pool and the rooms. were just awesome. Want to thank Mr. Denusha Kularenjaab from the front office who made sure my family and i enjoyed the stay and even walked us to our car when we were checking out. Only negative point was the check out which i found slow. Otherwise .......everything perfect!",positive
"We spent 3 nights at the Heritance Ahungalla in August this year. We were upgraded to the suite room, which had lovely ocean views, but the room itself needed to be maintained better. The bathroom particularly needed an upgrade and the tub into which one needs to climb into to have a bath is a disaster waiting to happen. I believe the standard rooms are well maintained. That said this is a great hotel for the price you pay. The main swimming pool facing the sea is fantastic as is the other one under a gorgeous tree. The restaurant buffets are extensive and the food is really good. The staff are very friendly and efficient. They have many activities planned for children. Would I stay at this hotel again - definitely!",positive
"We stayed in Heritance Ahungalla for 16 nights. I want to structure the Review in positive, neutral and negative things and because everyone seems to tell just the positive things i start with the negative ones. Negative: - Dirty beach; the Hotel does not care about the litter on the beach. Of course it is a public beach but there are only Hotel guests. Thats why they should clean it more often. - Beach Boys: they wait in front of the beach and even whistle or shout for someone. You always feel observed when you lie on the pool - Rooms are in poor condition. In the shower is mould, the curtains are dirty and the furniture is old (i enclosed some Pictures). This is definitely not 5-star-hotel-like! - The Hotel customer Service asked if we could give them a good tripadvisor-rating and they want to see if you give 5 points. Thats certainly the fact why there are so many good Reviews. - The Prices in the Hotel (if you dont have AI) are quite high. A 0,3 Liter Diet-Coke is about 3 Dollar, the dinner 26 Dollar. Very much for a Country like Sri Lanka. - When you leave the Hotel there are some Tuk-Tuk-Driver who want to bring you to the next herbal-farm or wants to sell you drugs. After our second try, we did not dare to go out -The Bar staff was quite slow and we had to wait almost 15 minutes till someone cared. That happened many times. Neutral: - Loud Room: We had a room over the bar and the bass was quite loud till 11 p.m. But most other rooms which are further away are certainly quiet. When we told this to the front desk they immediately offered another room Positive: - The architecture of the Hotel and the beautiful pools. - The Housekeeping and almost every Hotel employee was extremely friendly - The animals in the Hotel. There where cute chipmunks, funny apes, lovely ravens taking their bath in the pool, a lizard and even a big snake (i dont know if it was poisonous) - great Food. I dont think that you can find any better Food in Sri Lanka I just rate the Hotel with two out of five because it is made much better on tripadivor than it is for real. In my opinion it is not better than a european 3-Star-Hotel and i know that sri-lanka-standard is far lower than european but unfortunately the Prices are not like Sri Lanka (Massage 1 hour- 100 Dollar!)",negative
The hotel has an excellent service... amazing beach view.. tasty food with a delicious buffet breakfast.. the rooms are very clean... with a great staff.. we expect to visit it again.... Reception staff is very friendly.. shanikaa is the best....,positive

I'm not afraid to say that heritance Ahungalla is the best resort in Sri Lanka. It's marvellous architecture made us surprised. As we entered to the hotel we were warmly welcome in their style with traditional mouth refreshments and also with a trolley of 3 welcome drinks.. . It was delicious. The view was likely to welcome us with the infinity pool.. I should mention the hospitality of the staff. We didn't feel that we were at a hotel and it was like our home. Wish we had more days remaining. Love this hotel a lot. Highly recommended!,positive

"An amazing stay. From the moment we arrived, I felt totally relaxed in the beautiful grounds here. The staff here were amazing, Very friendly and very attentive. Our room was clean, bright and comfortable with a beautiful fruit basket to greet us on arrival. The rooms are only steps from the two gorgeous pools or the soft beach sand and waves. We ate breakfast and dinner both days of our stay and the food was delicious. All of the dining areas have a lovely ambience. I look forward to returning again one day xx",positive
We really enjoyed our time in this hotel. The staff were very kind and helpful. As we were on honeymoon they paid special attentions to us. The hotel and surroundings are incredible. The room was big and comfortable and the restaurant had a huge variety of dishes.,positive
"We had a lovely weekend at this hotel. The staff is really friendly and helpful and ever ready to go that extra mile to help and make your stay special. The food was great and well presented. I must specially mention the lady who made the hoppers. She was very friendly and chatted as we waited to get a hot hot hopper. The hoppers were delicious and crisp. The pani appe (honey hoppers) and the kiri appe (milk hoppers) were out of this world. The rooms were comfortable and the beds were soft and we had a very restful time. We also enjoyed the night club all though I would have preferred a variety of music rather than there very techno music played. Some times we do need to slow down to catch our breath!!! The games bar was a super place for us to gather and play cards and we enjoyed chatting there. Being six ladies chilling out, it was a great meeting point. The downside - balcony was flooded and the water did not drain away, we went during rainy weather. Also the corridors were wet and needed to be mopped ore often.",positive
Thesis one-night magnificent hotel because it is very big spacious natural blends wishbone environment.. The rooms are of very high standards... The housekeeping staff cleans it very well... Also the food is very delisious there is excellent service here... The pools are very big.... you should visit the spa because it is very relaxing and very good... I enjoyed it a lot.,positive
Wonderful location with an unbelievable ocean and nature views .... ecxellent services with fast and lovely stuff .... I will surely come back again.... tasty food full of choices and international kitchen .... pool is one of the best I ever seen ....,positive
We have always found the hotel hospitality to be fantastic and the food presentation and quality was second to none. The pool was excellent. Thanks for going the extra mile and making our stay memorable.,positive
"We Have been coming to Heritance Ahungalla for over 15 years. We experienced the same warmth and hospitality right throughout. The food was of a very high standard, accommodation was very comfortable and the staff always made a special effort to make our stay memorable.",positive
Your hotel hospitability is very nice the environment is very lucrative and gorgeous the food presentation and quality is very good... The childrens day programme was very nice and encourages for the kids and as parents i appreciate it ... Thankyou,positive
"It is with great pleasure and enthusiasm,we joined hand in hand with Heritance ahungalla to celebrate world Toursim day on September 2015 as one of Geoffrey Bawa architecture lovers.We actually came here to relax and forget the busy time for a moment.There we always find the amazing hospitality extended by wonderful staff of ahungalla. The weekend was super busy.But the excellent staff did not forget the 'world Tourism day'.Sunday when we come for breakfast,the windy lobby was decorated with the theme '1 billion tourists 1 billion opportunities'.I saw lots of Europeans were taking shots of that wonderful creature.They have done the creature for the last whole night. even though the weather was rainy and gloomy,they have organized a Mangrove planting ceremony at Madu river with the help of community and neighbors.They took us there with extra care and explained the importance of such kind of activities which leads to sustainability among the nation.We had a boat ride and went to the other side of the river and there the Engineering team of the hotel had done a great a job to make the event success. It has brought to the notice,that They have done a series of events related to world tourism day.awareness programme to the staff.beach cleaning campaigns and poster and essay competition to the students are few. It is with much pleasure my family also get involved with this celebrations and for a moment we came to think about nature and the spring of country where we live.Our special thanks goes to management and wonderful staff who always try to do a different thing to the nation as I have heard. Because this kind of events depict the cooperate social responsibility that a sector must do.thank you for remembering us,such a momentous moment. We Love heritance ahungalla and the staff!!You are doing brilliant!!",positive
"Having stayed at Heritance Ahungalla many times previously, we experienced the same warmth and hospitality right throughout are 4 day stay.. Check in was very fast, the food was of a very high standard, accomodation was very comfortable and even though it rained continuously we had a very peaceful and restful stay. Full marks to GM Rifan and his team for maintaining such high standards. Will definitely be back! I would recommend Heritance Ahungalla to all those who wish to visit the beautiful south coast of Sri Lanka!",positive
One of the best place to stay your vacation. Great hospitality shown by all staff. Great food with vast variety and nice view with the beach aside. Came with my lovely wife after a one month of our wedding. Hope to come here again soon.,positive
"After 2 nights at Centara Ceysands we came to Heritance for another two nights. i had called to the resort before hand reporting to them about our bed bug problem at Centara telling them we were apprehensive that another such experience mustn't spoil our holiday further. the reservation department put in a request at the front desk for upgrading us, the gentleman at the front desk went out of his way to make sure we got a fantastic suite. the staff at Heritance is extremely friendly and prompt. Truly hospitable ! we were given a fantastic 1 bedroom suite with a huge balcony that overlooked the beach. the rooms are very classically done. they used cinnamon oil as fresheners and glass bottles for toiletries as opposed to the plastics that the other resorts use. very eco friendly! the house keeping was prompt and very helpful, they provided us with two extra beds without any charge for the children in the living room. the resort has two lovely pools, a gaming area with carrom , pool & fuze ball tables. they also had organised activities for children. the restaurant that served buffet was the only thing that needs slight improvement, the food was not as tasty as most other places. however the variety was surely enough. they even had a cultural performance at night which was delightful!!!",positive
"Everytime we visit here, the service is extremely good. Enjoyed the food very much; specially the masala dosai we had in the morning was the greatest I've ever had, really liked the sweet hoppers (pani appa) too. Lovely hotel to relax with all the comforts. Will definitely visit Heritance Ahungalla hotel again in future. Truly, this is the only hotel out of Colombo in Sri Lanka that we never got disappointed about anything it offers, everything is perfect.",positive
Best guest service ever..I liked everything. The rooms here are very clean and of very high standards ... the pool is very big and beautiful... I love the infinity pool. I felt like I entered into one of the prestige hotel. The music in the pool bar was nice.. overall its a lovely hotel.,positive
"Stayed at room 359 from 26th to 27th September 2015. It was a wonderful experience with the staff ever ready to offer their services whether it be reception, restaurant, or house keeping. They even had organized a mangrove planting event yesterday to commemorate the World Tourism Day, such is their contribution to preserving nature. Thank you very much TEAM HERITANCE AHUNGALLA for your uncomparable hospitality during our stay. We would definitely visit you again.",positive
"Loved everything about the hotel - great beach, food, rooms, perfect setting, amazing and polite staff. Would definitely be coming back :). The breakfast and dinner buffets were both delicious.

"We spent six days in this hotel from Friday 18th September 2015 to Thursday 24th September 2015. Overall, we were very pleased by our stay here and it was a welcome break as we had been touring Sri Lanka for the five days previous. The hotel itself is very stylish in its design where the architecture is blended in with the surrounding environment. We particularly liked the wall along the main ground floor corridor which was open air with creepers coming down. Our room was on the first floor. It was a generous size with a massive double balcony overlooking one of the infinity pools and the beach. It was stylishly furnished and it had good air conditioning. It had all the features you would expect such as a safe, tea and coffee making facilities, a good amount of drawer space, mini bar and plenty of free bottles of water. The main down side to it was that it got pretty noisy, especially between 09:30 and 11:30. It is directly above the pool bar, close to the reception area and every night, there was some entertainment there. Any chance of having an early night was scuppered because you would get daily renditions of ""Lady in Red"", ""I can't help falling in love with you"", ""Wonderful tonight"", ""Yesterday"", ""Strangers in the night"" and other modern classics in various different musical arrangements. Saturday night was really bad. The room shook for two and a half hours and you could hear every word of every song played. We were on the verge of demanding a different room but decided that we didn't want the hassle and ended up putting up with it as some nights were a bit more subdued than others. Looking back, I think we should have demanded a different room. I think that the rooms further away from this area are probably very quiet and peaceful but if you ever get given room 226, this is what you will get. The amenities are very good but perhaps not of a five star hotel. The spa was excellent. My wife had a Balinese massage which she thought was fantastic although the spa prices are equivalent to salon prices in the UK. The gym had some reasonable facilities, including rowing, running and cross trainer machines. It had a reasonable weights section. The infinity pool and resident pool were beautiful. The resident pool is quieter and has a beautiful tree which stretches down almost inside the pool - pure genius in design. It also has a jacuzzi. The hotel is in a fairly remote area and you need transport. There is a resident taxi service and we were told that you can take a public bus or train, or even a private rickshaw. The hotel did not give out much information about local transport (such as timetables) and you could not book any excursions through the hotel. You were asked to deal individually with the resident taxis (which demanded prices nearly as much as UK taxi prices). We found the financial amenities we a bit limited. My advice is to take plenty of cash with you to Sri Lanka. I was hoping that the hotel would have an ATM but it doesn't. It offers a money exchange service but will not accept card transactions - it's cash only. The nearest ATMs are a 10 - 15 minute drive from the hotel. Furthermore, we decided to pay our final hotel bill a day early and use up our remaining Sri Lankan Rupees for drinks on the last day. Unfortunately, the hotel doesn't accept cash for food and drinks purchased. The hotel overlooks a beautiful beach although the sea is too rough and you are advised not to go into it for safety reasons. The main issue was that there were various hawkers who stayed just the other side of the hotel boundaries. As soon as anyone stepped out of the perimeter to go onto the beach, they would get hassled by these hawkers wanting to sell them anything from garments, excursions, meals at their own restaurants etc. The hawkers would employ typical marketing methods, such as following you, shaking your hand, calling you from a distance , beckoning and enticing the children of hotel residents as a way of getting a sale. The staff were excellent. They were very attentive and provided a great service. The hotel customer relations managers worked tirelessly along with the rest of the staff. We felt very pampered. The food and drink was exceptional. The main restaurant laid out buffets for breakfast, lunch and dinner and they were of a very high standard. There was a large range of choice: salads, Western food, Chinese food and Sri Lankan food. I would say that on the whole, the hotel is more suited to large groups and families.",positive
"This is the 3rd time we have been here, specially because the hotel looks lovely, the wonderful buffet & the great service. The service is excellent as always, staff is very attentive. Would like to visit again in future..",positive
One of the best hotels i have been tooo the fasciitis in the hotel are very good and alot the service here is so good specially kausalya at the reception one waiter at the pool bar.

Surpurb customer service and attention to detail; welcome drink and nothing too much trouble - broad sandy beach and dramatic and expansive Bawa designed pool with a magnificent vista looking out to the ocean. Rooms big; beautifully designed with sea views wide array of dining experiences. On a major bus route half way between Colombo and Galle ease of access. Nice library for holiday relaxation.,positive
"The buffet was great, like the one at Kandalama, clean rooms, large pools, plenty of space to walk around, great for couples; but beware of the locals near the beach, they will rip you off, offer tours and extort you in the process, Hotel staff ignore what goes around so your on your own",neutral
"That was my holiday from maldives and I really wanted a change and time to spend with my kids and wife.i selected you ""Heritance Ahungalla which is a proud product of Geoffry Bawa.I am surprised getting the history of that great architecture. My room was excellent and Special thanks goes to Chathuranga in front desk who took all my troubles. Then my one night stay even though short.. U all made relaxing and comfortable. Should mention Thushara and Praveen whom gave best service in dining.It is a pleasure even sampath said 'hi' to me and my family though he's busy.my family is happy like never before.. Pool is amazing where my kids enjoyed lot.I should mention piumi the girl who always familiar to me and my family. Even Though she's silent in appearance,she came out of her way to give the best. My stay with you is actually a five star.if I can rate more...will do to the end... Highly recommended the property!!!",positive

Superb Hospitality. Good food. Pure Vegetarians face no food problems. Beach facing view from the room. Worth a vacation. Peaceful. Beautiful scenery.

The service is really great and what is expected from a 5 star hotel. This was my second time here and the hotel is very beautiful and has a very nice pool area. Unfortunately I thought the food variety was poor and should have been much better from a five star hotel. Apart from the food I do not have any complaints.,positive
"Had an awesome stay in the resort. The lobby view of the sea after the pool is breathtaking.The staff is very friendly and warm. Food was good, many restaurants to choose from. Loved the other swimming pool with tree almost inside the pool. We had taken a sea facing room, the view was good but partly blocked by the pillars. The only issue was that the washroom walls were damp and didn't have the 5 star feel. Rest everything was brilliant. Would return again :)",positive
The beach is clean and the sand is very soft. The service is excellent.. The food delicious and the people very good and kind. The pool is very clean. The hotel structure is nicely done i will definitely come to this hotel again . I tell you to come too.,positive

"Having had our honeymoon at the Heritance Kandalama 6 years ago, during this years' vacation to Sri Lanka we decided to experience another Heritance Hotel with our families and we are more than happy over the stay at Heritance Ahungala. The pictures do not do justice to the beautiful landscape and ofcourse the highly commendable team; the excellence of service by the Aitken hotel staff is something I always admire. Very smooth checking & checkout with special thanks to the Front office Manager Lakshitha who was very informative about the services offered and organized everything for us. Tharindu we will never forget your sincere smile and the service. We were offered a lovely cake congratulating for our 6th wedding anniversary. The surprise birthday cake for my brother in law was also well presented and special thanks goes to the Restaurant & Bar Manager Thushara, Madu, Panditha and of course Chef Thilakaratne you are doing an amazing job to make sure the team is serving the best food and tirelessly looks into making a happy dining experience. We really loved the food and the variations (makes me wanna go back!) The ""yare tea"" at breakfast was something to remember and loved the variety of hoppers (yum ""pani appe"" after ages!) Of course we will come again. You will not regret a long stay over here with delectable food, easy access to the beach, 2 beautiful pools (loved the green pool), outdoor sauna, well equipped gym, and within close proximity to attractions like madu river safari, turtle hatchery, & less than an hours' drive to Galle.",positive

"I used to visit this hotel from a long time for and every time I came, every moment is unforgettable. The service, find, the location and very specialy the staff really fantasti, super, friendly. Every time they went beyond their limits to help and serve all their guests. Yesterday when I was about to go to hikkaduwa to see my friends I found my vehicle was broken and it was very disappointing to me. The hotel general manager was courteous enough to provide me his vehicle with a driver and told me time is not a problem and for me to spend as much as I want. I have never come across so much of hospitality anywhere else. When I came back it was surprised to see that a carrier from auto mirage was on the way to take my vehicle to repairs. This morning the front office manager asked me to relax at the pool and that they will look after everything. This type of caring, hospitality where can uou get ? Being a cricketer we all talk about heritance Ahungalla and all love to be here. It is true that this place is about home away from home. Thank you all for all the services and the help given to me, of course I wil recommend this hotel to everyone, I am writing this all to know that this is the best place in sri lanka to be at.",positive

"My husband and I were here for our honeymoon, and everything was superb! From a friendly greeting at the entrance, to an upgrading of rooms, to celebratory cake and munchables, and absolutely friendly service till the very end, they went out of their way for us. The food was out of this world too! We ate heartily on both days. The rooms were quite beautiful and spacious, and opened out to a view of the pool and ocean. We both loved it so much. Would definitely stay here again. Oh, and the view of the main pool and the ocean as you enter the hotel is to die for!",positive
"Great rooms, friendly staff, beautiful location, tasty foods , lovely atmosphere. Nothing to complain about! Enjoying a lot at this lovely place. Would highly recommend this place!! - Chathuri and Sajith de Silva!",positive
"We stayed here from the 6 September 2015 for 12 nights on a Mercury holiday on an All Inclusive basis.We were 4 persons in 2 double rooms.The resort is superb from the moment of arrival in a huge open lobby area looking out over a large pool to the sea,you are escorted to a seat for checkin,provided with a choice of cool drinks and a cold towel.We had requested 2 adjacent rooms on the ground floor sea view and were given 2 excellent rooms,very spacious with A/C,fan,TV,safe and very comfy beds.There was a large shower room with lots of hot water and toiletries.The rooms had large patios with furniture leading onto a grassed/garden area then direct onto the beach.We had all our meals in the Jute restaurant which was buffet service,the choice and range of food was amazing with a mix of Sri Lankan,Western and International and in particular a never ending supply of delicous prawns,cooked in front of you and other chefs cooking specific dishes.In addition there was always a friendly chef checking at your table to see if all was okay or to prepare you something more selective to provide you a unique and special personal dining experiance every time.We also had a great waiter Waruna who ensured we were well supplied with drinks.Also the Senior restaurant staff visited your table to ensure all was okay to enhance your dining occasion.There was also a 24hr snack service restaurant which we used a number of times when we had been out and missed the regular meal times.There was a very nice bar and seating area by the main pool which had an open or covered area where we used to enjoy drinks during the day and in the evenings there was always live music with a show on Fridays and Saturdays.Also in the evenings at dusk before dinner one of the workers played a flute sitting on a boat by the pool as the sun set,again a nice experiance.Also the senior staff of the hotel would circulate and chat with you to ensure all was okay,to mention a some in particuar they were Shymalee,KK,Ranesha,who were all hardworking individuals,we all felt KK was extremely talented and an asset to the hotel.Also all the staff throughout provided superb friendly and efficient service.The hotel has 2 very large pools in landscaped gardens so you had plenty of privacy.Throughout the hotel there was free WIfI service available as well as a nice quiet library ,which had a free computer to use,a great service.We can all say please ignore the earlier negative reviews about poor food,service and especially ants, as thats just not the case.Its truely a great hotel to enjoy a superb wonderful holiday experiance.",positive

"Great hotel set on very quiet beach. Rooms are spacious and comfy beds, pillows help you to drift away after a relaxing day. Food is amazing and caters for all different pallets. Chefs will cook to order and even offered me boiled egg and solders. All the staff are really friendly and go out of there way to make your stay as pleasant as possible. You will feel valued. Be aware that if you do trips out that the roads are not the best and you may have some very early starts. Also airport transfers take 2.5hrs to airport and you need to be there 3 hrs before flight takes off. 5hrs added to your journey time. Relaxing holiday in good hotel.",positive

Had a good time with my wife in this hotel. The hotel has designed in a beautiful structure and swimming pool and front pond brought a marvelous scenery to my eyes. Very calm and quiet environment. Rooms are comfortable and service was up to the standard. Foods were delicious and the staff were friendly. We were really enjoyed and will definitely come again in next year.,positive
"We have stayed at the Heritance Ahungalla very recently, as our initially booked hotel was closed for refurbishment and we were relocated to the Heritance Ahungalla - at the end, the best thing that could have happened to us. We arrived around noon at the hotel and were greeted with fresh juices directly by the pool. Our rooms were not ready upon arrival, which was no problem for us, as we opted to have lunch first. As my husband and I got married at the Heritance, we were given a complimentary upgrade to a Luxury Room and my parents were given an upgrade as well to Premium Room. Our room was lovely, having a huge terrace overlooking the sea, as well as a lovely bathtub with sea view. The food in the Main Restaurant is good and the waiters were always friendly. They could however been a bit more attentive, as some of them were rather slow and did not notice when guests were without drinks for more than 15 minutes. The desserts were a delight. My husband and I got a Candlelight Dinner on the beach on our wedding day, which was lovely, despite the rather heavy wind. Our waiter (I unfortunately forgot his name) was very attentive and made this evening even more special for us. We took a trip down to Galle, as well as to the River and both trips were pleased and can be recommended. We booked those trips however not with the hotel, but with the guys on the beach. The wedding itself was fabulous and the decoration was beyond words. We were given a tree planting ceremony as well and will surely never forget this special day. We would also like to thank Shanika, the Guest Relations Executive, who took so special care of us. I had annoyed her with several Emails prior to our stay and she was always polite and ready to help. All in all, I can recommend this hotel to anyone, looking for tranquility and friendly staff. The infinity pool, as well as the beach are simply amazing and hard to describe in words. We will surely be back one day to check on our wedding palm and to enjoy the hospitality at Heritance Ahungalla once more. Thank you all for making this stay so memorable for us!",positive
"I had read so many great reviews about this hotel and was really looking forward to staying here, and I somehow feel like I have stayed on another planet compared to the other people who reviewed here. I will comment that the Chef Sarun was fantastic and made the best meal we had in Sri Lanka, the gentleman who was serving us was very good. Now, the hotel is getting very tired and could use a renovation, I was first taken to a room with 2 single beds, being a couple this wasn't good enough, but also laying on the bed it was comfy, the second room had a double bed but was uncomfortable, so we left it to the young man who took us to the room to try and sort out something else - either putting blankets under or a pillow top, anything, we gave them 2hrs and nothing happened. I went to reception, spoke with the executive gentleman, who apologized and said we could look at other rooms, apparently they only have 1 type of mattress which I don't believe. In the meantime I had ordered food from the restaurant and was told it would still be another 15mins away, we proceeded to the next room, same, next room same, so I said I would settle just for the twin singles as we were only staying one night. He then said he would get a new room sorted out and have our luggage moved. When I got back, my food was waiting and it was cold, less than 15mins. I advised the waiter and he said thanks- what for ????? We waited 1hr for no key, went to reception and collected our new room key. Went to the room, located at the end of the hotel, and our luggage was not there yet. Next thing I'm looking at the table and there is ANTS EVERYWHERE, now I'm talking about 1000+ all having a little party on the ground and under the table, walking down the walls etc. I have plenty of photos which I will put up when I have better Internet at home. I rang front desk and we got moved again 2 doors down, we went for a swim for 1hr again, come back and there was more ANTS in the room. We didn't get offered another room, but got dinner which is the only reason this gets a 2 star and not 1. We didn't sleep very well and the band / music was playing very loud well into the night. We had to check out at 7am, I had ordered a breakfast, but when I went to check out, I was hauled to the cashier office, and they kept me there for 10mins arguing about the meal from the afternoon which was cold and I was told would be taken off the room, and, they also tried to charge me for a phone call from my room, which was the executive ringing the manager about the ANTS. The lady who apparently was guest relations needs to be sacked, the cashier needs to be sacked for trying to rip me off. This left the worst taste in my opinion of Sri Lanka and I cannot believe this hotels staff would act like this to customers. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone, hopefully management looks at this and takes action.",negative

"We visit there as out department annual trip. From the start the experience was terrible. General check-in time was 2.00 p.m. Be we waited for ever to get our rooms. We were at tjhe lobby and we had to check every 10 minitues for the room availabity. After great difficultly I manage to get my room around 4.00 p.m. Room condition was not that satisfactory either. to get the hot water after turning the tap it took considerable time. First time I thought there was nop hot water. Bidet shower was made awful loud noise. In the restaurant if the table is not prepared it took some time to prepare it. I still missed certain items like napkins, I asked for severral times and eventually continue witho out it. Food was average in both lunch and dinner, but the brakfast was better. Inside the rooms the cellular service was poor, sometime absolutely no reception. I can't find any reason for this but all my friend experience this issue.",negative
"This is the second time I've take my team to Heritance Ahungalla and would do it again! Very accommodating, flexible and helpful management team, with a special mention to Mr. Gamini who went out of his way to make this a special weekend for the guys. Thanks again for everything from Team Virtusa",positive
We stayed here for two nights and the hotel is good though it is quite old now but still the food is good and staffs were friendly. The pool was great.

This is a hotel that has been beautifully designed by the great Geoffrey Bawa. It has recently been renovated by Channa Daswatte. We stayed in a very spacious and comfortable luxury suite. The food was excellent with a very wide range of local and western dishes. The staff was attentive and looked into our every need from the moment we arrived in the hoteo. I must make special mention of Thushara the F and B manager who helped us in numerous ways. We will definitely return for another holiday and I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel for anyone looking for a holiday destination on the Southern coast,positive

"We stayed th Sep. 7th Night at Heritance Ahungalla and it was a superb stay. We checked in a bit late around 8 in the night but from thereon to today the service and the staff had been absolutely helpful. The Food and the Cleanliness is also at an excellent level combined with the astonishing architecture. We reserved a Luxury room but it was upgraded to a junior suite by the Hotel itself for the reason of having a bath tub in the wash room was one of the priority for our reservation of a luxury room, and not having one in luxury rooms they upgraded us. The view also pleasant and top pf it all the staff is really friendly and assertive in their very own way.",positive
Great stay and very friendly staff particularly Ranisha at check in and check out. Good choice of kids activities and complimentary warm milk for the baby from room service.

"This truly is an amazing place. Everyone is so friendly, helpful & nothing is too much trouble. We have never been to a friendlier place where everyone greets you with the biggest smile & always asks if there is anything you need. My wife chose to celebrate her 50th birthday here & her choice couldn't have been better. I had liaised with the team at the hotel to arrange a few surprises & they pulled out all the stops to make our special celebration perfect in every way. They decorated our bed when we were out & provided the most delicious cake which added to the wonderful experience before whisking us onto the beach for a gorgeous meal. The food is delicious in every restaurant. From a quick delicious snack to their amazing buffet or absolutely fantastic fine dining experience. To have Michelin quality food served on the beach is something special. It has been a pleasure to see & meet the chefs responsible who are so proud of what they do & boy do they do it well. The bars are as welcoming & the big smiles & friendly staff make you feel so welcome that you never want to leave. The rooms are beautiful. Spotlessly clean & the room staff work tirelessly to ensure you have everything. If you're thinking of going somewhere but don't know where, come here. You will not regret it & I am sure you will come again as we most certainly will. Thank you to the staff who we now class as friends. You know who you are. Best regards Dave & Maria",positive

"We stayed 3 nights in a deluxe room - extremely comfortable and well appointed. Slept like a log every night. The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful at all times. The hotel itself was designed by renowned Sri Lankan architect Geoffrey Bawa, with great attention to detail - it is in a tropical style with lots of open space and courtyards/gardens within the hotel. Two huge swimming pools, and of course the beach (ocean swimming seasonal though). This is a great location for exploring the surrounding area - lots of other Bawa designed hotels and gardens to visit nearby, and of course the Unesco world heritage old town of Galle (Fort), which is a gem.",positive

"If you're looking for a calm and relaxing stay on the sri lankan beach, heritance ahungalla is the place for you ! The heritance chain of hotels hasn't ceased to amaze our group, each one very integrated into it's surroundings and has a unique architectural carasteristic proper to their respective regions. Our room was on the ground floor and had direct access to a nice isolated pool, and in case you get bored you could always take a dip in the indian ocean just a few meters away. Service was very good, staff very friendly and welcoming and the food extremely tasty. However the gym was a bit too small for me and lacked machines and weights...",positive

"The room overlooked the sea, and was comfortable The amenities were good -as expected from the Heritance group. The food and beverages department went out of their way to make vegetarian food for us. I would like to thank Shyamalee, Gamini and chef Chaminda for all the tasty meals we had. The beach is not a private one: so a place should be earmaked for keeping footwear. My new pair of slippers (fortunately not very costly ) was stolen.",neutral
"A great hotel to stay. Staff are very friendly and helpful. I would like to specifically thank Mr Thushara, Restaurant manager. He was very humble always and very friendly. All the other staff are very friendly and always smiling and willing to help. Some hotels only treat foreign guests well and ignore Sri Lankan guests.

"We visited historical , Ahungalla heritance hotel with our family members in the month of August and we were immediately embarrassed by the warm welcome and thospitality that SriLanka always known for. The hotel equipped with two large swimming pools including the (green pool) , beautiful garden which connects to the beach in front of the Hotel. Delicious as well as the variety of the food , ambiguous of the resturents, hotel premises and the most friendliest staff made us falling love with the place and one of the most enjoyable trips for us. However, to mention I would suggest that the property needs a bit of a renevation due the old look , and the cleanliness of the rooms and the bathrooms in peticular. Nevertheless I still recommend this wonderful property for couples and families and even for individuals who like to relax and unwind and experience the beautiful warm SriLankan hospitality.",positive
"The staff was very friendly, welcoming and very helpful. We really loved our room that opened up to the swimming pool and enjoyed our stay here at the hotel a lot. We stayed at a few hotels this holiday and our best highlight of the Ahungalle Heritance was the pool and great hospitality of the staff. We enjoyed our morning walk on the beach followed by breakfast which had a great spread!",positive
"Recently we had a enjoyable family holiday at this sea side holiday resort. The hospitality we received from the time of arrival until the departure was excellent. A special mention must be made about the staff at the main restaurant who provided a stellar service despite the week-end crowds. The food was really good and there was a wide spread of international cuisine ranging from Indian, Chinese and Western to Sri Lankan food catering to visitors from all over the world. The housekeeping staff also provided a very good service by keeping our rooms clean and providing new linen on a daily basis. We will surely go there again.",positive

"Booked over the phone for 3 nights which was ok enough. Nice enough hotel with a decent location though the beach was not as nice as you'd get in the east coast or even some Other parts of west coast of Sri Lanka. Most of our time was spent in the 2 pools as were the others from what it seemed as the sea was too rough during our stay. Food was ok, mainly buffet type of food with a decent variety though the fruit selection seems to be the same everyday (melon, papaya, pineapple & guava) Rooms and the hotel was a little dated to be honest and not worthy of 5 or even 4 star, especially compared to some of the other hotels we've stayed during this trip to SL. I do admit though that I have high expectations usually and wouldn't mind paying for it but this hotel was rather less expensive compared to the others and kind of explains why you get dated room & decor (get what you pay for right??) One things I should mention however was the price of food and drinks. It is an absolute rip off when looking at the cost of drinks. All the menu prices are expensive enough , but they add a mandatory service charge of 10% and government VAT 12.5% on top of the final bill which make you pay about 800 LKR (about £4) for a bottle of Corona. Note that local beverages are not cheaper either. A small bottle of water is about 225 LKR which is little too expensive compared to other Sri Lankan luxury hotels. The location itself is not close to Galle so not much to do outside of the hotel. We did do a boat trip on Madu river (about 10 miles out) which was as well worth it but I'd suggest you don't book through the hotel and go directly to the Balapitiya bride where you can see many tour operators and get a boat for a ride. Takes about 90 mins and cost us 2000 LKR (£10) which was well worth it. There also is a turtle hatchery that you can visit which is nice. I probably wouldn't come back to this hotel to be honest as I wasn't overly impressed but could be a decent location for the average, budget conscious traveller looking for a bargain, as long as the price remain cheap.",neutral
"Had the most wonderfu holiday. Good food, great staff and service. Food is excellent. Staff is amazing. This is our 10th visit. This is our favourite place. Every time when we have a free time we love to come here.",positive

We have just come back from a very nice stay at heritance ahungalla..!!The hotel is great & staff very friendly & helpful. We had all inclusive here which probably was a really good idea as there are not many restaurants around the hotel. The buffet restaurant was absolutely yummy ! We ate Sri Lanka food the entire time. It was really good & so much choice. We love curry so much which Tusara served us..really went for it .me and ma wife had conversations with him every night..he was from heritance kandaalamaa he said us and show photo of it to us...I loved all the veggie options & my partner the meat. We tried so many different dishee ! Breakfast was great too..thank you Gamini especially the egg hoppers & dosas. The beach is stunning & still However we found a very good jewellers called Gemtruste..our room was 203...& left hotel on 27-Aug-2015..Greetings from Kevin ..!!!!! hope to come again..!!,positive
This is an amazing hotel in a fabulous beachside location. The room was excellent and the benefit of two pools meant one could decide which to be in depending on how busy the other was. Food was very very good with action stations at every meal and it was obvious the management aimed to go a step further with the food. Staff were very friendly courteous and again went beyond their call of duty to provide a first class service.having visited many beach hotels and we were asked to select one....it would be Heritance Ahungalla!,positive
"Set on the beach Ahungalle, from the moment you set foot in the hotel - and are offered traditional fruit drinks and tea, you can tell this is a special place.

"Had very nice views, Got the best service from staff. Should mention that we experienced the best pool in SL & delicious meals, comfortable sleeps & comfy sanitation.... this is one of the best places where I would visit again in future...",positive
"OMG....if, you are planning on losing weight avoid this hotel at any cost ;) The food here is an absolute treat to any palate! The prices are quite reasonable for a hotel of this calibre. # ALL staff members are: friendly, pleasant and very helpful. # The rooms are spacious, cozy and neat. # bathroom is very clean & smells quite heavenly with a soothing cinnamon fragrance. # try the spa....worth it, especially moms; feels energised n relaxed ! # library : take your own book into that comfy shelter, nothing much to read there (in English) # there are two pools. The one as you enter is the noisier n lively pool. The other, is for the more relaxing types....or...that's what it looked like? :( no changing rooms; that's a bit messy if you visit the beach. # all restaurants are good. Very obliging staff. # try the cocktails they suggest -i cannot remember the names, but was delicious! Thank & bless all at heritace ahungalle especially the GM, Mr. Refhan for making our holiday a memorable one :) best regards, Smith family..xx Ps: Try the ice cream sandwich - yum!",positive
"Awesome holiday and a super amazing hotel (one of the best hotels in Sri Lanka) Staff is extremely friendly and helpful especially Mr. K K, Anushka and Ranisha. Felt like home away from home. Will definitely coming back. Keep it up Heritance Ahungalla!",positive
"Wow!!!!! This is the perfect place to stay for your holiday... The food was mouthwatering and well presented... The amazing Staff...They are very friendly and always with a smile especially Mr. KK, Raneesha, Shanika and Anushka.... We will definitely visit Heritance Ahungalla Again and recommend for my family & friends...",positive

Best hotel ever... I recomend this hotel to everyone.,positive
"Very nice hotel. What stood out for me is the attitude of the staff. All were friendly and service was prompt. The hotel has a beautiful beach and pool. Entertainment was available for kids too, So parents manage to get some me time. The only downside was the food. It could have been better...but the look and feel of the hotel combined with friendly staff made up for it.",positive
Thank you for the wonderful stay! Great food and service. The staff were very friendly and attentive. We especially enjoyed the spa! Wish we could have stayed longer. If we had only one room for improvement that would be to ensure that a strict no smoking policy is adhered in all rooms as one of our rooms had a strong cigarette smell which the staff did their best to remove.,positive
"Heritance Ahungalla is an excellent hotel, the staff is awesome in the restaurant and reception. I enjoyed every moment here. The rooms are very clean and good and there is nothing to complaint about. The food is very tasty.... There are 2 pools in this hotel. I enjoyed both pools.",positive
"Very accommodating, the service was exceptional, food and accommodation was also upto standard. The hotel interior was well decorated and it was quintessentially SriLankan We will definitely Visit again.",positive
"The stay was very refreshing excellent view, there was a wide spread of food. Excellent service and friendly staff always waiting to assist... Thanks for the rejuvenating time we had. Manoj and Dilrukshi.",positive
"Heritance Ahungalla is a great place to visit if you want to spend your leisure time enjoying the view of blue ocean. Staff is very keen on fulfilling requirements of guests and their service should be appreciated. Comfortable rooms, two large swimming pools and other facilities made our stay full relaxing and enjoyable.",positive
"Good service. And so beautiful view. Good choice for your trip. Food is delicious. Clean and comfortable room. Stuff is so friendly. In a word, love this hotel so much. Big swimming pool. Blue sky. Whit sand. Clean water and so on.",positive
"Room was average considering we had told them it was our honeymoon. Food was not up to par when comparing with other hotels in Sri Lanka until we spoke to one of the chefs who made us a traditional Sri Lankan curry and brought it to our table. Think they try to cater for far too many people instead of sticking to traditional dishes. We were told that it would be good for snorkelling but the sea is too rough all year round. Better snorkelling a few miles down the coast. Staff were useless at bringing drinks. Could take an awful long time waiting. We got bored with the bar and mundane entertainment and walked along the beach to a ramshackle hut called The Sunset Bar where we were given a warm welcome by the locals who run this place. Ending up dancing on the sand. Soooooooooooooooo much better than listening to polite, elevator music back at the hotel!! Wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone and wouldn't go back. There are much better hotels around.",negative
"A gorgeous resort, fabulous buffet. A place I would return to. Great room, very clean, the beds are awesome. They serve breakfast and dinner in a beautiful garden. The beach is very close to the pool. They allow to bath in the pool during the night.",positive
Excellent accommodation with rooms overlooking the beach staff friendly and helpful. General Manager and Executives set the bar for the quality of service. Entertainment was a mixture of western and Sri Lankan. The entertainment provided by a group of staff members was of a high standard. A variety of food both western and eastern was offered.,positive
"This was my second trip to Heritance and I have nothing but good to say about it. A group of 5 couples including my husband and I were looking for a break from Colombo and we chose Heritance based on our first experience back in Dec 2013. The GM Mr. Refhan saw that our needs were taken care of and we were left in the very capable hands of the F&B manager KK who truly went out of his way at every meal time to accommodate any requests we had. We thoroughly enjoyed the buffet at every meal and especially enjoyed our last dinner which was set up beautifully outdoors for us upon request. The staff were helpful in showing us which food was halaal and have clearly marked out any items containing pork to avoid confusion. I'd also like to acknowledge the friendly and helpful service of Tony and Nelka at mealtimes as well as the lovely lady who welcomes guests to the buffet with a big smile (whose name I didn't catch). I was also pleasantly surprised at the other friendly lady who welcomes guests at the entrance with sugar cubes who actually recognised me even though it was almost 20 months since my last visit! Unfortunately the sea was too rough for swimming while we were there but we had the pool and games room as well as library for entertainment during our stay. We also went on a boat ride nearby on the recommendation of the hotel. We got to see some temples located along the water, cinnamon being peeled and experienced a fish pedicure! It was a nice outing particularly in a group. Overall we were all very pleased with our stay at Heritance and would recommend it to others looking for a comfortable and relaxing stay about 2 hours out of Colombo. The last thing I'd like to add which I forgot in my first review - I don't know where they get it from but Heritance has the most luxurious toilet paper I've ever come across! The little things all contribute to a great stay :)",positive
This a best five star hotel in sri Lanka where you can relax and enjoy your holiday. Service is excellent. Rooms are clean and beautiful. swimming pools are very big and clean.food is superb. We will come back again.,positive
My family and I visited for two days and we were happy with the hotel. We were impressed by the kindness of the staff and the beautiful location. We will definitely recommend this hotel to our friends. The rooms might need a little updating but over all we had a great stay !,positive
"I was able to celebrate my 21st birthday with my family and friends. Needless to say the staff was very hospitable. They catered to every need and set up the beach side to celebrate the evening. Beautifully lit up with lanterns and later in the evening surprised me with a cake brought by three pirates. It was like none other. The whole ordeal was done beautifully with the help of the careful craftsmanship from their in-house animation team. This was an experience like no other and I highly recommend this hotel for its hospitality and ever-so readiness in catering to their guests, whatever their needs or occasion. 5 out of 5 stars.",positive
Excellent hotel for honeymoon. Nice location for photographs. Staff us very good and helpful. Service is amazing. Clean and beautiful beach. We received fruits and nice cake with decorated room. Thank you fir everyone.,positive

Our family and friends were also very well looked after by Praveen and by all other members of staff. They simply can not do enough for us. We will all visit here again definitely. Dr Lenora, family and friends.",positive
"We reached this hotel on a sunday morning, it was around 11am, but it was crowded and appeared to be chaotic in a not so appealing way. But, the recpetionist tried to welcome us properly, within their current crowded circumstances. But, the second day, the hotel became a little bit calmer, less rush, and we enjoyed our time on the pool. The rooms are nice, but the balcony and terrace needs retsoration and maintenance. The breakfast is good, we had lunch twice in the hotel, it was good. we had dinner once and it was good too. Overall, it was a good place, not astonishing, but it was good.",positive
"Every year my family visits Sri Lanka we make it a point to take a trip down to ahungalla and stay at the heritance hotel. The service is truly five star and second to none. The buffet, especially the Sri Lankan spread is unbelievable and so delicious. The hotel is very well maintained and the staff is courteous. Special mention has to be made of Thushara, the restaurant manager who personally overseas that all guests are happy after each meal. We will definitely go back next year! Very family friendly and our kids (age 6 & 4) loves staying here.",positive

"A beautiful hotel with large and nice rooms, tasty cuisine and great service. The territory is gorgeous with nice palm trees and huge sandy beach. Ocean is very shallow and warm with amazing colors.

NIAM~~ The staff is amazing, very hospitable and caring. The stay in this hotel was absolutely enjoyable!",positive

We stayed at the Heritance Ahungalla from 08 August to 11 August. I must say the service at this hotel is outstanding. We are seasoned travellers having stayed in numerous hotels from the carribean to the middle east to Asia. Every request we made was promptly dealt with and the staff went over and beyond to exceed our expectations. Being foodies the chef even cooked us up a special Sri Lankan meal on our last night - Bravo Heritance team! Thank you from me and my family!,positive

"i stayed at Heritance Ahungalla for 2 nights on my honeymoon. it was the last hotel in our Sri Lankan tour and it was one of the best. upon arrival we were greeted and offered refreshing juices while waiting for our check in. our wait went a bit longer than usual but this was only because we were upgraded. thanks to Kasum, and our room was being prepared. the hotel has 2 pools which was nice, and a very nice view over the beach.",positive

"This is our 8th visit to Heritance Ahungalla. We are returning visitors every year as we are extremely pleased with the highest quality of service we have received and this has been consistent throughout all our stays. We are frequent travellers having stayed at many 5 stars hotels around the world, but this hotel has been outstanding and hence our return here each year. We would also like to thank the GM, the front office manager Indika and all the front office staff and special thanks to Chathuranga who organised kite flying for our 2 children. The food at this hotel is beyond words, it really is amazing. Compliments to the great chefs, Dimuthu Kumarasinghe and junior chef Dayananda. The chefs have recently won awards and we can totally agree that these awards are very well deserved. The hotel restaurant service is excellent and special thanks go to Mr Gamini and Thushara. Special thanks also go to Chamith and Raju the 2 Animation staff who entertained us with a variety of sports and activities for our children. Chamith and Raju are an asset to this hotel, they are both hard working with great personalities. The rooms we have had have always been super clean and spacious.

We have visited this place three times within this year and on every visit we have left with big smiles and plans head of returning soon. Our daughter celebrated her 4th birthday here in June and she was treated like a princess, and everything happened just as she expected, it was her wish from our last visit to come back for her birthday. We would like to thank you all the loving staff for making this place truly amazing with their friendly and welcoming nature, they always have smiles on their faces.",positive
"We stayed there during middle of off season. But the hotel and the staff didn't seem to be like that, they had the liveliness that others lack during mid off season. Even the buffets were filled all the time and the varieties of seafood offered during that particular period was really good. Other than the infinity pool which has a breath taking view the hotel also has a resident only swimming pool that is partly covered by a tree and with a bar next to it.",positive
"We stayed in room number 136 for one night with my 3 boys and husband. It was such a memorable stay. The view of the Hotel is breathtaking. We fell in love with the pool instantly. Overall the staff was excellent. Mr. Indika from front office, went out of his way to make our stay a memorable one. The staff at the main restaurant made us feel like home away from home. Thushara from main restaurant was so helpful and attentive. Unfortunately, we couldn't stay more than one night...but will definitely visit this beautiful resort in near future. Forgot to mention about the diviyan Spa. I recommend anyone to try the Balinese massage from Mey. She was such a professional therapist. Thank you all for making our stay a memorable stay.",positive
Execelent very well. Resturent is very good.pool is really nice.its very nice because of the beach & the view also nice . Room service also very good.its is good to spent in lessure time .

We would like to mention some names. ..nuwan sasanka and kitchen sadun all so Thushara. We would like to visit again. And we can recommend this hotel for anyone .,positive
"Spent one night near the beach. Got nice looking spacious room in front of the pool. Room service was really good and they have delivered the order within 10 mins that's something to consider when ur really needing it. Courtiers and best staff u would find and also we had a wonderful calypso session near the beach till midnight. staff given us their fullest cooperation. I would say a wonderful place to checkout if ur on the move and finally many varieties to chose from, food was good and loving it.",positive
"From the time we arrived to the time we left we were treated with excellent service. Our kids were treated with food that they wanted (fish and chips with nuggets), which were not even in the menu. All we had to do was ask and made it happen. Also they did not charge for these services. Ask for an upgrade and sometimes the management gives it, which is well worth it. hotel facilities were really good, the pools were the best. Keep up the good work, see you again during Christmas.",positive
Heritance Ahungalla is situated in down south and if you are travelling from Colombo the easiest and fastest route would be the southern expressway.Hotel is beautiful and the location is very attractive.Food is great with a wide variety of seafood.Staff is not as friendly as in heritance tea factory but they are helpful.We stayed in a deluxe room and it doesn't have a bathtub.All rooms provide full or partial sea view.Beds are comfortable.All rooms have a private balcony.During the weekend we stayed there it had rained and the balcony was not properly dried .Hotel must allocate a person to clean the balconies on a daily basis. The pool is really nice.Actually the hotel has two pools.The big pool can be used by both residents and outsiders and the small one is for residents only.During the night the hotel is entertaining their guests with a good band and Sri Lankan cultural dances. Overall its a good hotel.,positive
"The hotel experience at Heritance is one of a kind, from the pool that is overlooking the beach to the warm hospitality by a professional yet homely staff. Namely Thushara, the restaurant manager provided an aunthentic Sri Lankan guest experience which prioritize competence and warmth in the hospitality for the guests. Thushara ensures the needs of the guests are met to nothing less than excellence. I would gladly recommend this hotel to my friends and family in Sri Lanka as well as overseas and also i will be back during my next visit to Sri Lanka.

Most highlighted quality of this hotel is the friendliness and attentivness of the staff. Highly recommended for a relaxing holiday experience !!!! We checked in for our annual staff outing and it was a gereat experience. And also the hotel staff helped me in organizing my wife's birthday celebration which came as a great surprise to her. Keep up the good service.,positive

"Awesome food, superb environment and friendly staff. Convieniently located great place to enjoy your southern Sri Lanka holiday. Well managed hotel environment equipped with modern facilities. Well maintained sandy beach and swimming pools right across Had a relaxing experience before leaving for Colombo capital. Must visit!",positive
"We stayed for 5 days in July 2015 and had a fabulous stay. The staff could not have been helpful and genuinely friendly. The rooms were large with good sized shower rooms in the bathroom. The food was delicious with a really good choice of Asia and Western food stuff and 'to die for' sweets and puddings, all buffet style. Security is good and the hawkers now stay on their side of an invisable line, on the beach so we did not get hounded like at some hotels elsewhere. We enjoyed the company of Mr and Mrs Iguana who walk around the grounds and do not mind all the attention they cause! The main pool, overlooking the beach is large and the main focus when entering the Hotel. We would definately recommend this hotel.",positive
"Heritance Ahungalla is a hotel which is like a home away from home. I came here with my mom to relax and to get away from work to unwind a bit. From Friday evening till now food, service, rooms & hospitality has been truly five star in every sense. The view from the pool is truly breathtaking. Love the night skies here. Food, well....pretty everything you could wish for is here....rooms....spacious and plush. But more than anything what makes this hotel truly special is it's staff....they are friendly, professional and ensures that all your needs are met. I also noticed they have quite good conference facilities. So this is a hotel for all your requirements. I recommend to all to try here to experience Lanka and to truly unwind - Malith Kumarasinghe (Room 303)",positive
The night vertual screen night show was a nice experience..yammy foods with eye catching preparation and best service... when we are planning our next visit.... hope to catch Front officer: Chathuranga... he was KIT till we departure...thanks to all...,positive
"Last 28 th June was our first anniversary... Among all lovely memories of our wedding.. ""The stay with Heritance"" was stand out... Still we felt the smell of it..... From the warmth well come to good bye... Still we can remember Mr.Chathuranga( Front ) One of the best customer supporter we ever met..",positive
"The hotel lobby sets the scene for the hotel itself – a lobby spreading out into the infinity pool, that leads into the beach and sea. The staff provide a humbling and warm welcome, showcasing their hospitable nature from the moment you step inside. The pool is idyllic and the food showcases the talents of the award-winning kitchen. We were lucky to meet Celebrity Chef and 15 time Gold Olympic Medallist Dimuthu Kumarasinghe, and all I can say is that I am surprised he has not appeared on all our TV screens! A true culinary talent, and the most humble person, he has led an equally talent set of kitchen employees to create some truly wonderful culinary experiences. Thank you to Heshan and Kevin for giving us the best kitchen tour and pastry session, and Dinushan for providing a stellar hotel tour! All in all, this hotel is a must if you are visiting Ahungalla.",positive
"we were in heritance ahungalla 1 night. the service was superb. food was fantastic. staff was very helpful. specially in jute restuarant. Anushka, thushara, kk, chathurangà and supuni was ver helpful and so kinded. we can recommond this hotel and come back again.",positive

Very enjoyable stay. Good food. Excellent staff. excelent pool. Two big pools with jacuuzi. Comfortable rooms. Great beach. Bufet options excellent. Took great boat ride in madhu river. Fish massage a must try there. Overall 5 star hotel.,positive
"When you meet people like Chaturanga(Front Office),Chamila(Main Restaurant), Anishka(Hostess at Main Restaurant) it makes your stay,one of a kind at Heritance Ahungalla.My request for a quiet,away from the public eye sleep vacation was fulfilled with the choice of room.Excellent!Chamila at the restaurant with Anishka was always there with water before my glass was empty,to help us with chair n napkins every time we went to fill our plates.The warmth of the the staff at the restaurant gave us everything.....Chinese Chef Peter Li hats off to you for the subtle flavor of ginger, garlic, spices and sauces made the food irresistible!Pastry Chef Jagath created a personalized dessert for us that was .........Need I say more! He was always willing to share his recipes and made some of the best breads and pastries. For a Five Star Hotel, it surpasses all standards in SL with much more to do than we participated in.... If you aren't here, you haven't tasted Sri Lankan Hospitality",positive

"Awesome place, 2 huge pools, rooms are spacious and luxurious. Service is second to none - extremely polite and friendly staff are always at hand to assist. Beaches are beautiful. Local cuisine is to die for with an extensive selection of deserts at every meal. Highly recommended.",positive
Every time I cme to this lovely hotel a unique experience is guarantee. Even on off season the buffet is fine..lovely pool.. lovely beach.. great rooms and many more additions depending on the days.. love the cultural events organised by the management.. easy access with the new motoway.. MUST try place..,positive
"So much to say. The rooms were great, try for 3rd floor oceanview. The service was excellent. So many people to thank for our stay Klarathna, thushara, nerosh, varuna.. too many. Most particularly the front desk staff.. we toured sri lanka from Columbo to kandy to Penwalla to Nuwary Eliya to the hikkaduwa/batouna/Galle area. We had reservations with airbnb, and several hotels. When we arrived at the coast area we found none of the houses or hotels were anything like the websites depicted. All were filthy and trash strewn and very small. We came upon Heritance and were stunned . The hotel grounds are lush and clean, the pools were immaculate and the beach was clean large and perfect! There were multiple restaurants and bars on the grounds. There was entertainment . We stayed 4 days three nights and did not regret it. It should be said unless you a very comfortable with local foods and living conditions, this is the only hotel resort that offered a respite from the congestion and sanitary problems you may not be accustomed to. The hotel is also ideally centered between Columbo and Galle . We looked at almost every resort from Botouna to Galle, physically , while scrambling to find a place after being disgusted by our original ""resort"" this is far and away the best, by leaps and bounds . It is a five start resort at economy prices. ( we booked online in the lobby for a significantly reduced rate ) We also did half board which gave us breakfast and dinner. (We found this to be essential and we'll worth the little extra it cost) You will find the food choices were great and varied and the staff would accommodate any and all special requests. I wanted chicken noodle soup one night as opposed to the two choices and they made me a batch",negative
An amazing place with amazing food & best of all amazing service by the restaurant staff. Want to thank Mr. Thushara Gnanarathna & the team for the excellent services rendered. Also the extent to which the staff in the kitchen connect with the end customer is commendable. Keep up the good work...,positive
I decided to go on a holiday with my family to heritance ahungalla and I'm pleased to say that I enjoyed my trip to the fullest by experiencing an exceptional service. I'm also glad to dine on a great variety of cusine along with plenty of variety in food. The rooms are great with sea views and wonderful atmosphere. I am glad we selected this hotel and will certainly come acl again to Heritance Ahungalla. LORRAINE AND DAYAN,positive
"Our family had an amazing time here! First you are warmly greeted by friendly staff. As you walk into the hotel, the incredible views will take your breath away. The infinity pool seemingly flows right to the ocean waters. The pool is wonderful for the kids as it is not too deep so my five year old had a blast! The food is absolutely top notch. There is everything you can imagine at the buffet. Not only is it a LOT of food but it is high quality as well. You can even request specially made food that is not a part of a buffet. We were treated with an exceptional crab curry when we requested it! The staff is extremely friendly and are willing to help with anything you need. Also, it is probably the most family friendly atmosphere at a hotel that we have ever experienced. I highly recommend The Heritance!!!",positive
Leaving today after a very relaxing short break. The restaurant and staff are very accommodating and the food is excellent especially if you like Sri Lankan food. There are two well maintained pools and the hotel is on a lovely stretch of sandy beach so great if you have young kids. If you want to chill out for a few days this is a great resort.,positive
"The Heritance hotel is an absolutely wonderful establishment. With a star class staff to match, the patrons of this fine tropical getaway will be left with a lasting impression of the hospitality of the Sri Lankan people. A must see for any visitor to Sri Lanka.",positive
Thumbs up for this amazing resort in srilanka.. Great service and lovely staff .. Staff is very friendly always trying to keep the hotel guests happy .. At the checkin time we requested for a bigger space room and they gave us a luxury room with a beautiful sea view. Also should say about the food it was very delicious ..,positive
A lovely hotel with lovely staff. Beautifull blue sea ... evening sunset is the best scenery where you can enjoy.. the food was amazing specially the sea food and I had a lovely holiday with my family and we got a great experience coming to the best 5 star hotel down south... Thanks to David who ensured our stay was ennoyable and realaxing.... We will be coming back again for sure.........................................!,positive

Regards for Supuni and David with the wonderful smiles and great job with solving a few of our issues.,positive
As always fantastic. Rooms were superb. Staff was very friendly and courteous and food was amazing. Upon arrival till departure the front office took care of us like family. It doesn't look like off season to Heritance ahungalla but never been too crowded also. The service was like a boutique hotel service.,positive
"Such a beautiful country and hotel! A peaceful and charming stay with friendly and committed staff, as well as lovely food (both traditional and international cuisine). There is plenty to see and experience, and the staff are very good at helping you organize day trips. The hotel itself is open and serene, and designed by Geoffrey Bawa! Service is always good and done with a smile, and the hotel itself opens up onto a stunning beach surrounded by animals and nature. A lovely place!",positive
"Absolutely wonderful service! The staff was very friendly and helpful. We were particularly impressed with the attention given to make our four year old comfortable. The pool, room and the food were all superb. We will definitely return!",positive
"What's the point of going on a vacation, if you want to feel like home.? Heritance made me and my wonderful wife forget all about home... The meals.. the smiles... the activities.. the room... THE MEMORIES are so much... wr didn't wanna leave :(",negative
"Our second trip to sri lanka and what a nice place. Again we toured the country extensively, but this was a good place to base ourselves for a couple of weeks. The architecture is old school, which is cool. It's an older hotel but that just adds character. Nice place overall.",positive
Since This hotel is another creation of Legendary Architect it takes you to Old Charm . But the location and serene atmosphere is ideal for relax beach stay. Food is excellent as always . 2 large swimming pool gives more space to have a quiet dip at any time .,positive
"Being my first return trip to Sri Lanka in 20 years, there was plenty to explore. Ahungalla was always on the itinerary for this soul searching adventure, and it was somewhere I looked forward to visit with great earnest; it's beautiful beach being the main focal point. The Heritance added to that sensory experience immensely, having been greeted with the vast pond at the entrance, flowing on to the main swimming pool which looks as if it goes right out to sea. The service was impeccable, with every request catered for amicably and staff taking the ""service with a smile"" approach to another level, the food infallible, the ambience was exotic. It has left me yearning to visit again; this time, with someone special and it is an incredibly gorgeous place to be. 5 out of 5 without question.",positive
very nice hotel.................! food good people good.... service good Thanks to David who helped us with the checkin giving us a good room. every body in the reception helped us a lot specially supuni and shanika and I love this hotel alot.................................................. :-),positive
Excellent service.We enjoyed lot. Visited there to celebrated our 2nd wedding anniversary w our 10 month old kid. They specially prepared kids meal for her. Balcony open for thr Fabulous sea beach open. We booked deluxe room. But they upgrated it to suit room. Large spacious nicely arranged room. Two swimming pools are fabulous very closed to the beach. Wow......! They treat every guests as same. Either local or foreigner . Special thanks Should goes to miss Shanika (Guest Relations Executive )and Mr Thushara Restaurant & Bar Managing Executive. Thanks Heritance and the friendly staff for Making our 2nd wedding anniversary so marvellous ......!,positive
Great place for family holidays. Very friendly service. Ask for the rooms close to the green pool. They are very nice. Expect to be swimming in the pool under a tree and next to crows and squirrels. Amazing.,positive
"Plus: Rooms: nicely maintained, well serviced. Animation team: friendly and engaging Restaurant: staff are friendly and food is good and varied Beach and swing pool: attractive, but also some minuses. Minus: Price of drinks (e.g. wine, cappuccino, cocktails) too expensive compared with similar category hotels in Sri Lanka Cleanliness of premises: with a little more effort would this place be cleaner and thus more attractive. Windy weather conditions are not an excuse to leave things on the ground. Hotels in Sri Lanka clearly do an effort to group Chinese visitors together in the restaurant. This is not just a detail as the habits of these people was often experienced as plain impolite: noisy, jumping to front of queue ....",neutral
Wonderful hotel and specially friendly staff. Pool area is really big great variety off Food .I recommend this place to any one who wants to have relax holiday thank you for everyone.we will come back again...............................,positive
this has been our fifth visit where we still haven't got enough. we appreciate the people of heritance ahungalla more than anything that a hotel can offer. the hospitality of them from jounior staff to the top management is excellent.

They haven't lost it like a lot of hotels down south. There breakfast spread was quite impressive. Rooms were nice and had a nice view of the ocean.",positive
I went with my husband and had a great stay at this hotel. Reception and lobby area is huge and spacious. U can see both the pool and the beach from there. Amazing view. We stayed in a deluxe room and it was nice and cozy with a balcony overlooking a pool. It was very comfortable. Staff is well trained and courteous. The only downside was the food which was totally below expectations. But all in all we had a great tym.,positive
"Heritance Ahungalla Beach Resort is one of the best Hotels to stay. It was the first time for my husband to stay in a hotel in Sri Lanka, he is a Swedish National. I booked Heritance Ahungalla online for my husbands Birthday, it was a surprise gifts from me to him. He loves the Beach and the Sun. When we arrived to the hotel the reception staff was very helpful and friendly. They welcomed us with soft drinks and cold towels, they escorted us to our room. On the the day of my husbands birthday he received a birthday cake to our room. The room was really nice with a sea view. The food at the restaurant was really good, they had different variety of food to choose from. The staff was very friendly and helpful, always with a smile. We both had a wonderful stay at the Heritance Ahungalla, and definitely we love to stay with them again. Keep up the good work.",positive
The holiday at this hotel was a really nice experience to me and I just can recommend it to everybody. The staff is really keen to make your stay the best.

Special mention to chef Thilakaratne, who was very accommodating to our special meal requests. The restaurant staff were very friendly and provided excellent service, some of whom were Anushka, Thushara, Udana, Chamila, Sanjaya, Jananjay and Ishan. Overall we had a fabulous experience!",positive
1st Strange that I am the first to review this in 2015 despite this been a popular destination. Before going I had a look at the web site. I saw a couple of brocken links and informed them but they did not respond back to me... I was a bit skeptical as a 5 star hotel needs to keep its web site 5 star. My skeptism was correct when I went there... I felt the staff was not bothered about good service. They were in general NOT FRIENDLY. The hotel I found not to be well maintained. Things are getting old and discoloured. They did not have a changing room for the pool. Thus you need to change in your room and go. Through the hotel to the pool (I am talking about the main pool). Food was good. Generally it was ok but I was expecting a lot more. I would say this is more of a 4+ star hotel than a 5 Star.,neutral
This is one of my all time favourite hotels and I absolutely love coming here. My family and I have been coming to this hotel for 20+ years and we remain throughly pleased. The service is spectacular and so are all the other attributes that the hotel has to offer. I love this hotel and recommend it to all!,positive
Very nice hotel with kind and considerate people who take care of whatever you need. Always looking out for the guests which makes the stay enjoyable and pleasant.

The other thing was the Hotel is a Masterpiece by Geoffrey Bawa, a great Sri Lankan Architect. Thank You Heritance Ahungalla Team for a Unforgettable Experience...",positive

Was there with a bunch of my friends and the place was a hideout for us at a perfect place along the beach. The staff were truly amazing loved our stay at this beautiful place.... They have this really cool bar at the pool where you can sit and relax for hours. The hotel was a great masterpiece of the great sri lankan architecturer Jeofery Bawa. the architecture was truly blissful....,positive
Really nice place to visit. The moment I entered we received a really good welcome and Kasun in particular assisted us with the check in which was smooth. We got a complimentary upgrade. Great place and highly recommend it to people around looking to relax and enjoy the beach 😃,positive

"I stayed a Saturday night at the hotel (F/B) in June with my wife. We didnot book the room, it was a wedding gift, so no idea about the prices. Staff was very friendly and the room were spacious and well furnished (safe box included). We got two beds instead a double which was the only issue encountered other than the door lock (the door should be pulled before unlocking, otherwise it wont open, first time we needed to get assistant). However the restaurants were located on one side and the rooms are on the other side, therefore you will have to walk a bit through corridors to get their. There were two swimming pools, one was located adjacent to a big tree, so you can swim under the shadow of that tree which was a nice experience. On that day there was a show (like cultural show), live music and DJ at the night. Food was really delicious, specially the deserts. Dinner buffet main course was having few varieties other than that all meals are excellent. Dinner, breakfast and lunch were buffet style. Service includes valet parking, use it because the car park is quite away from the hotel and quite difficult to locate (no sign boards, around 200m). Wifi was available but we didnt try since there were enough signal for my mobile (Dialog Telekom) In summary, the place is really nice, staff is friendly and providing better service. After all I could recommend this place, it will be a good experience.",positive
Me and my wife stayed here with our two young kids and I would say that this hotel is wonderful and very kids friendly. Staff are great from the time we got down from our car till we left the hotel. Food was wonderful. As a Sri Lankan and a Marriott platinum member I would recommend this hotel to anyone who would like to enjoy the Sri Lankan hospitality specially for the ones traveling with kids.,positive
"I travelled alone did a 5 day tour and ended at this hotel on the beach, the staff were amazing so thoughtful and friendly, Rooms were spacious and comfortable.The restaurant was closed for redecoration, so breakfast was in the conference room, as there were not many people staying, it was not that nice and told Mr KK, I asked if breakfast could be served outside by the pool, as this was far more attractive, he said it was not possible, the next day the buffet was outside by the pool, well done to Mr KK and his team keep up the good work",neutral
We stayed for a few days. Everyone smiles and tries their best at this hotel to make your stay wonderful. From the time we arrived we were impressed the warm welcome. The food was top class with lots of varieties for vegetarian or sea food lovers. The cleaners never seem to stop. It is very clean too. We recommend this hotel without hesitation.,positive
"Heritance series hotels are the big surprise in this journey. Heritance Ahungalla and Kandalama are both good design, very harmonic with the nature.

Excellent hotelextremelyit with family and friends Food is delicious with a wide spread and a very good choice Rooms are spacious and comfortable Hotel staff is extremely friendly and helpful The ambience is ideal for relaxing especially if it's a family visit It would be great if the check out time could be extended to 2pm instead of 12pm. As a whole I would recommend this hotel to anyone and in fact a few of my friends have already visited on my recommendation!,positive
"Me and my wife stayed there in 20-21 of June, 2015 weekend (one night stay) to celebrate our second anniversary. We were in a deluxe room and it was clean and spacious. The staff was great and we were very happy about their service. And the food was amazing... all the meals were in buffet with lots of varieties and they were very tasty. And there are two pools. One pool (called Green Pool) is only for the residents and it is very beautiful. We enjoyed a lot and would like to thank all the staff for making our stay wonderful.",positive
"After 5 days we are leaving this wonderful hotel. The location is perfect by the sea and close to the village in case you feel for experience the ""real"" Sri Lanka"". The food in the restaurants is good, and the service is very good. I really want to point out the greate staff !",positive
I recommend this hotel to everyone. The staff is great and so kind. They will help you with anything you want. The food is really tasty from the different restaurants. And the view is fantastic. The beach is right in front of the hotel.,positive
"Definitely a wonderful hotel as we keep returning, more often now. The service is exceptional and the staff are always working with a smile. The view is beautiful from wherever you are. The food is very tasty and just tickles our taste buds. My kids love the hotel and want to return again soon. Amazing!!!",positive
"Me and My husband always makes time to visit this wonderful gateway once a year! Last Saturday with great difficulty we managed to get a room, Even though the Hotel was extremely full, they as always accommodate our last minute getaways! Well what more can I say! My heart pours out to all the staff members, who tirelessly work towards our satisfaction! The team is wonderful and the coordination between departments was excellent! My favorite is the homemade Ice cream! But they didn’t have it in the Buffet but my desire to have it was fulfilled with a Smile! Thank you so much for obliging! That was indeed a very sweet delight! As annual visitors to this amazing place it’s always like going Home, from the time I get off the vehicle to the Sad good bye the smiles and the hospitality you show is not available anywhere else! Hats off to the Management for maintaining such amazing standards from the inception! Looking forward to my next getaway next year!",positive
Very warm and welcoming staff with a beautiful property right at the beach. Very relaxing. The evening live flute at the beach was very beautiful! The dinner organized at the beach with beautiful lamps was a great experience also! Will definitely visit again!,positive
"This is a beautiful property .The infinity pool is amazing and so too is the architecture , the work of the great architect Geofry Bawa. Even the river pool for residents was well located and the tree branches growing over same , made it picture perfect to what you would see near a river. The kids and all of us on holiday had a great time in the pool. The rooms were also well designed , spacious and very clean. It was perfectly located and both the pool and beach was accessible very easily . Room service too was very responsive and all the staff are readily available to help with a smile .A suggestion to the management , pls subscribe to more cable chaneels especially for kids. We had great expectations on the food . However was somewhat dissapointed in this area. Did not like the lay out of the restaurant and although the food tasted good , the spread and choice was a let down. All things considered this is a highly recommended property. We had a lot of expectations on the food",positive
We spent the weekend 20- 21st June at this hotel.The hotel is located facing a lovely beach. The staff were very helpful and the service was good. Room service was also prompt. We enjoyed our stay and wish to thank all the staff of Heritance Ahungalla for making our stay a wonderful one.,positive

The rooms are comfortable and have a scenic view overlooking them. The buffet is elaborate and delicious. My kids loved the wide variety of delicious desserts that they serve. It's a happening place with some or the other activity happening in and around. Completely loved the place. Me and my family had a great time.,positive

"The staff at Heritance is the best. They are all very friendly. I stayed at Heritance in March and the stay was so good I came for a longer period of time in June. What impressed me most is that many of the staff remembered us. The Sri Lankan culture is the most friendly of any in the world. Great Place, Great people.",positive
"Staff here is very nice, helpful and friendly, smiling all the time :) they helped me a lot with my little injury and had kind understanding for my initial hystery :) I would reccomend this hotel if you would like to stay a while near by the sea having opportunity to choose from a great variety of delicious food.",positive

"This hotel is near the sea and the swimming pool is pretty. Beautiful beach. The food is also good. Fresh fruits in breakfast. Goooood. We want to come back again with my family. Plus, the price of buffet is a little expensive",positive
"So disappointed with our return visit to this hotel. 5 star this is not,! Food was disappointing and variety poor. Stale bread rolls at lunch/dinner which were obviously left over from breakfast. We weren't told that alternative food was available & only found this out on the day we left !!!! The rooms were obviously designed by a man as they were not women friendly. Main lights in the bedroom were 3 downlights, really how are we supposed to do hair & make up??? Sink in the bathroom was too high we are not all tall. Plain glass in the bathroom with blinds that were obviously an after thought. We will not be returning a 3rd time. Al so no evening entertainment that we know of",negative
"I joined NKar Travels recently and this is my first outing in weekend with my colleagues.We had a nice welcome from the GREs and we just felt we are in a paradise. Breeze was lovely and we spent the evening in the beach.Took plenty of photos and had an unforgettable cocktail party outside.That was a great opportunity to get to know my colleagues. Should Mention Mr.Chathuranga (If I am not wrong ,he is the Front office Executive)always looked after us and very attentive.Dinner was amazing and we had a variety of food.We really could not select what to serve.There were few outside dinner tables too.Following day ,till our departure we could enjoy each and every single moment in the hotel premises.It's unexpected that I saw a very familiar face and thought for a while.It's one of my batch mate,Piumiya..and glad she is working there. During Lunch time,restuarant was kind of busy,but we did not feel that since we had the best food with tasty desserts.They served us a tea with cake too before we check out.I actually recommend the place to anyone since they all know the word of Hospitality from top to bottom.Will come for my honeymoon surely.",positive

"Great hotel with exceptionally professional and friendly staff. Clean rooms, beautiful pool with warm water. Very photogenic beach (although we couldn't swim because of big waves). However, in spite of the moonsoon season the weather was sunny. We had a special dinner at the beach at our anniversary day. It was really romantic and delicious. They even prepared special cake with a hand written wish on it for free. We were invited to see the kitchen which was surprisingly clean and well organized. The selection of food was always very wide and everything was well prepared. We enjoyed our stay here and get relaxed.",positive

Once again we are at this hotel and it is one of the best by far. The service is great and the staff are very friendly. The food is always very tasty and keeps our tastebuds stimulated.

As usual our stay was as good as last time . Already coming back next year Really enjoyed the pool as always specially my 3 year old The staff were excellent and very accommodating to our needs . The only negative I can think of is that the exchange rates hotel gives is very bad so have your money exchanged before coming to the hotel.,positive
"everything was spot on. We really enjoyed all the meals, specially the desserts were a killer. Room service never bothered us and our rooms were always clean. we loved the pool the beach and also the staff. they were very friendly and polite. We will surely return :)",negative
"Just come back from an excellent week of rest and relaxation including getting married. We loved the room we first stayed and when they upgraded us after our wedding it was even better. Very big room. All the staff were so friendly, helpful and the service was first class. Loved the views and the pools and the food was plentiful and delicious. Above all else our week was made memorable by our wedding which was excellently organised by Shanika with dancers / drummers and an elephant. All went without a hitch followed by a great meal on the beach. Would highly recommend a stay at this hotel.",positive
"Nice service and very polite. Staff is very friendly. Pool is just the right temperature. Beach is not crowded... good for beach runs. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner buffet has many choices of foods and desserts. Overall, wonderful stay!",positive
We are From Nkar Travels and we enjoyed the one night with u all in every mean.We enjoyed dinner well and cocktail party was lovely in the night.Front liners were excellent and they came out of the way to help us.Two pools were nice we love Green Pool.Palm Reading session was useful and long life to him.Special thanks to Narmika.We had lots of photographs.Resturant staff was always attentive and Tony looked after us always.We will recommend this place for anyone and Good Luck all.,positive
"Everything was wonderful - the views,the rooms, the food and the helpful and smiling staff.had a lovely fine dinning on the beach.Highly recommended.it's a lovely place to relax. Mr and mrs Thirimanna",positive
The place was nice with beautiful views. The food was good but overpriced. Also the service was slow in the cafe. I think it was too expensive for the place and to charge almost 3500 lkr for a dinner buffet that had a great salad & dessert bar but the main foods was very limited. I am pretty sure they do not have generators because when the power was out there was backup current. I would recommend that you take a walk down to the beach and take a right to white villa restaurant or take a left to Jungle beach to eat. White Villa has an amazing lookout oint for a sunset....,neutral
We came to this amazing place which is located one of the best down south coastal area in a nice evening with our collegues.wind breeze was superb and mxed with cocktail party gave nice feeling.food was delicious and staff is doing a great job.special thanks to madhumini for her extra care taken.we are enjoying each and every moment in beautiful ahungalla premises.,positive

"Stayed at Heritance ahungalla for five nights and found the staff excellent.they have a beautiful pool .that is magical looking straight out to the ocean,the beach is all so very nice,but the sea was rough at this time of the year.

We had superb time with my family 👪 & friends.supporting staff welcome us & continuously treat us well untill we check out.thanks all your fabulously meals make us happy......😋😆 ...................,positive
"My wife and I got married here in December 2014. Shanika was the best wedding planner we could have hoped for because she ensured we felt like VIPs throughout our stay - nothing was too much trouble! We sat down with her a couple of days before the wedding to arrange everything we needed (she had a great list to fill so we didn't forget anything) and then paid for everything by VISA the day before the wedding. We loved the quiet pool and the attendant who helped coax the monkeys down from the tree every evening and picked flowers for us every morning. The main pool was the perfect photo and my favourite place to sit with a cocktail and enjoy the view. The bar service at the main pool was pretty swift but often the quiet pool was unattended and drinks could take 30 minutes or so to arrive at your lounger even when empty. The wedding day itself was almost laid back yet perfectly structured so everyone knew what to do and we were kept busy throughout! If anyone is considering a wedding here I highly recommend it and would be happy to talk to you about all the details if you send me a message. The location was fantastic, nice and close to the railway station and far enough away from any other hotels. I recommend a walk along the railway line (some great photos of children playing and cows eating on the track) and a very short walk along the beach to see turtles and big waves break against local fishermen on the rocks. If you want to get away from Ahungalla, a tuk tuk to Bentota cost us £3 return. Definitely go to Kosgada turtle sanctuary, it will only cost a few pound but you get to learn about their life cycle and hold one. I have dropped a single star for a few issues which let down the overall experience slightly but dropping any more would be crazy considering how amazing everything else was. The first issue was I paid around £700 to upgrade our room through email to the hotel a few months prior to our arrival as a surprise for my wife. Unfortunately the member of staff who took the booking left the hotel and the details had not been passed on so we were given the wrong room on arrival and the surprise was ruined when I had to start digging around for electronic proof I had upgraded the room (despite me handing my paper copy to reception on arrival). Secondly some of the rooms are noticeably tired. The first room (the wrong one) had obviously been given a face-lift and looked to a higher standard of finish than the suite we had upgraded to. One of the sinks was blocked, the shutters had fallen off the rail, there were some damaged pieces of furniture and the balcony door would not lock properly without brute force. Two members of staff would beg for us to leave alcohol on the side for them to drink. On our last night all of the regular restaurant staff had changed shifts and the food quality and service level fell considerably! It took 25 minutes for our drinks to be served and we watched a waiter down my grandma's glass of wine!",positive
"Me and my wife came to Heritance Ahungalle to spend two days of our Honeymoon. We are very happy what we got from the hotel. It is really valuable. We came to the hotel at the time of a heavy rain. Me and my wife got somewhat tired due to the journey when we were check-in. But because of friendly service of the hotel staff we were so happy. We had a room upgrade. Meals were so good and evening events like dancing, musical shows really attractive. We enjoyed very much. This hotel consist a pool called as ""Green pool"". It is like bathing in natural water stream under the trees. I liked it. From the day I made a booking to the day we check-out everything went well. My wife appreciated me for this selection. I would like to visit all the other ""Heritance"" hotels . Thanks all.",positive
"We went there for a honeymoon package and got a superb room with breathtaking view of the pool and the sea. we stayed for two nights and the entire facility was fantastic. Both of us felt their excellent hospitality from doorsteps onwards. Front officer ""DINUSHA"" took us from the first steps to the hotel and addressed our all necessities with out a single mistake and delay until our final foot-prints. The entire team was perfect and well trained for their duties. Their soft-skills were really highlighted. The food is delicious and the combinations and variations in the buffet are really appropriate. The room was very clean and they are having a very good room service. This venue was the honeymoon gift for my lovely wife and she was delighted on it. The stay at Heritance Ahungalla would be ""THE MEMORY"" of our six day honeymoon trip. TRULY....THIS PLACE ADDED LOTS OF COLORS TO OUR LIVES.......! THANK YOU ALL........!

"our stay at Heritance was memorable !!!!!!!!!!!!.............,,The scenic view, and comfort stay, excellent hospitality gave us an immense pleasure for years to come. We would recommend a stay for anybody will be memorable and no next to home . Heritance is highly recommended............,,,,,,,,",positive
"I had the Heritance recommended from someone I know...clearly we have different taste or it was a different Heritance they stayed at. We booked this place for our last night in Sri Lanka as closer to Colombo and also looked lovely from the website. We so wished we had stayed at our gorgeous little boutique hotel in Mirissa instead! I won't make that mistake again...this is definitely a nice enough place for families or people looking for an all-in-one, resort experience, the beach is very pretty and so are the pools and lounge area with lots of grass and trees. Our room was OK but as many people say, 'tired' and not the cleanest ever, although a very good shower. The food, a buffet, was decent, but definitely nowhere near the food we had during our entire stay in Sri Lanka at a fraction of the cost. We had a hefty service charge added to our bill simply for ordering 1 bottle of wine at dinner! We booked a massage at the spa there which was good, and took advantage of the tennis courts. There are certainly plenty of facilities, but the various sales-people around selling tourist goods and palm readings made it that little bit more resorty/touristy for us. Overall, definitely not for the traveller who likes to stay less 'chainy' hotels (I was also enticed by their 'eco' claims but not sure I saw much to support it?) and I would not call it 5 star, but I probably made a mistake in booking it in the first place for what we wanted!",neutral
"This is the third Aitken Spence Hotel we've stayed at during our tour of Sri Lanka. Although my first impression of Heritance Ahungalla was not good because of problems with our initial room in this tired, ageing establishment. However I have to say that the reception staff, and Shanika in particular, stepped in and immediately moved us to a lovely, very spacious room. The room we are in now is more in keeping with the standard of our previous hotels. The award winning chefs here at Heritance Ahungalla produce food which is every bit as good as previous reviews suggest. The breakfast buffet provides a fantastic choice which caters for all tastes. But if you want something else or need help with the Sri Lankan specialities then KK, the assistant restaurant manager, is on hand with some useful advice. The hotel is in a great location directly on the beach and within easy walking distance of a couple of good beach restaurants. Yet walk out the main entrance and you're right in the midst of Ahungalla where there are a few shops and where the friendly locals enjoy chatting to tourists. It's also where you can hire a tuk tuk to take you further afield to other local towns, villages, restaurants and so on. The main town of Galle with its many places of interest is about an hours drive away by air conditioned mini bus. Or you could try using the local buses, which stop right at the hotel's main entrance. Although this old hotel needs refurbished it's still a very pleasant and relaxing place to stay. Its greatest asset is the staff - friendly, helpful, happy, accommodating and above all professional!",positive
We had a lovely 2 day stay at the Heritance. We had a free upgrade to a luxury room when I told them my son desired a Bathtub with the minimum of fuss. The food was excellent. Looking forward to another stay.,positive
"I travelled with a friend who was known to the staff. I was treated like a friend rather than a stranger. All the staff were attentive, wanting to serve and please. The Chefs deserve a special mention as all meals were superbly presented and served with pride awaiting the pleasure we were about to encounter - taste buds were in heaven! I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the South West Coast. The drive from the airport is worth it. Paradise is waiting for you. Enjoy the facilities in the Spa, pool, gym, library, games room. I could list all 50 + members of staff who looked after me, but thanks to Shanika, Thushara, Nihal, KK and Manjula especially. You all deserve a mention. THANK YOU.",positive
"We arrived here for our last leg of the tour, what a beautiful hotel. Large spacious hotel lobby overlooking the pool and the ocean beyond. We stayed in one of the suites which had an extra-large living room and a beautiful room and a huge bathroom with a Jacuzzi bath tub and a separate shower, also it had a half bath. And also an extra-large balcony. The drinks and the food were no exception. Something for everyone. A huge local curry spread and European dishes for those who like that. I really enjoyed the food and the chef made a special steak for my husband on our last day which he enjoyed. My husband and I also used the spa which was non like I’ve had in the US. I had a Warm stone massage The therapist were well experienced and we left feeling completely relaxed. Well worth the money we spent. And I can’t say enough about the staff. They were all so friendly and helpful, Sri Lankan hospitality at its best!!! Thank you for making us feel so welcomed and special. Can’t wait to visit you again.",positive

"We have visited this hotel so many times from the time it was known as Triton. It simply feels like home for us now. The staff are always warm, friendly and quick to respond. The best part according to us is the most amazing residents only pool and the ability to use the pool till late (Most hotels don't allow guests to use the pool after 7 like). However, it is just one of the pluses. The food is simply amazing from the variety to the taste especially the desserts. The last time we went there in August 2014 we got a complimentary suite (I don't know the reason why) and my dad was kind enough to let my husband and I stay in it even though he was paying :) (we were newly married) We will keep on visiting Heritance Ahungalla because we feel at home there and for the amazing food.",positive
We were with our friends 2 days in heritance. I would say it is really nice plays to stay. Room quality and help of the staff is brilliant. Food is superb. I would not hesitate recommend this hotel to anyone.,positive
Friendly staff. Superb food and hospitality. Nice sea view and sandy beaches with natural beauty. Best conference rooms for meetings. Had a great stay. All together it was a excellent service. All these for a reasonable price. One and only Heritance ahungalla.,positive
A good place to enjoy the evening sunset. We went for an offial conference everything was well aranged. Nice iconic pool with a sea view. Nice Sri lankan food plus various foreign tastes as well. Easy to reach. Good luck to the hotel crew.,positive

"Excellent place, beautiful views of beach from the lobby and the rooms, dinner was amazing with sea food being freshly cooked n served. Room service and the hotel staff are really polite and soft spoken Highly recommended.",positive
Having travelled to every continent in the world id say - The hotel is a 4star property Mr. Pahan at reception was the friendliest face whose smile calmed me many a times Beware of house cleaning who on three occasions walked in the room unannounced Due to the climate the buffet area have a lot of fruit flies over the food at fruit and salad counter which is disgusting Not many options for alacarte so best is to take a full board package If ur a light eater then half board is good Best part of food is the sri lankan cuisine Pool is amazing and beach is untouched which are the two features i loved most Overall de-stressing and relaxing Will definitely go back hoping for a better experience Used the spa which was average - they could do better with the massage and ambience Oh yes and pls carry shampoo and shower gel as the provisions at the hotel not user friendly - Globe trotter Ms Dsilva R,negative
"Two of us stayed here for a business trip to this area. The staff are fantastic, friendly, courteous and ever helpful. The hotel itself is on a beach and the views are incredible. The Internet is not strong enough in the rooms, our mobile devices seemed to work but when trying to log in with computers it was a different story. The hotel was quiet, 1/3 of the rooms full yet the hotel still gave us two rooms above the karaoke that started at 8pm thru to midnight. We both moved room but not sure why the hotel would give these two rooms when the noise was so loud the walls were shaking. The restaurant was also a disappointment - cost wise was actually higher than some 5 star hotels in Colombo, and the quality not as good, as well as the restaurant under renovation and moved to a banquet room with no view - overall food was a disappointment.",negative
"Another of the Geoffrey Bawa architectural hotels, this one is smack bang on a lovely beach. Rooms are spacious and ours on the ground floor had a private patio not too far from one of the enormous pools. I found the staff incredibly willing to please and all seemed to love working here. I hope the owners treat them well. The fridge in the room didn't work but we didn't need to use it anyway. Wifi was fine and the bed comfortable. I loved the way they placed my husband's pyjamas on the bed decorated with flowers -shows how much they want to make you smile. The restaurant was wonderful and the food seriously good. They even have a children's table with kiddie accessible foods. The sculptured butter statues leave you admiring the unbelievable skills of the chefs. As I was in a group the staff gave us a tour of the kitchens which I found one of the best and most unusual attractions every experienced. They are meticulous and so very proud of what they accomplish. I would like to say thanks to all the staff for making my stay so memorable.",positive
stayed 2 night here and it was the most wonderful and memorable moments of our lives. staff is amazing and very helpful. delucious food. lovely pools and very clean beach. rooms are neat and tidy. colonial type which we love. room cleaning done twice a day. i loved the evening bed decorations. thank you for taking care of us. we felt truly home away from home. would come back for sure. highly recommended.,positive
"We had an amazing time and enjoyed the lovely hospitality of the most friendliest courtiest staff whom I have ever met. Mouthwatering food. Lovely location, clean beach and would like to recommend all. Diffinetely would return. Thank you all for your excellence service.",positive
What an entrance! This is one of the most stunning views of a swimming pool and beach that I have seen when you enter a hotel. The rooms are of a good standard. We were upgraded which gave us a lounge as well as bedroom. Although very nice I don't really see the point apart from extra space as most of the time would be spent by the pool and beach. Although the hotel was very nice I would not recommend you stay here at the locals holiday time as it became rather chaotic and the restaurant felt more like a cafeteria.,positive
I was here with a large (300+) group and the staff was able to checked all in without any delay. and staff is kind and very helpful. The most notorious thing is food with exceptional taste and quality.,positive
We had a very good experience. Rooms were clean with a very good beach view. Food was good too thought I would recommend the management to add some more chicken dishes. The only problem we noticed was the presence of insects over the sweet dish counter.,positive
"Was here over the weekend for our annual staff trip. Was impressed by the check-in counter as they managed to check-in all 160 of us in about 1/2 an hour. The staff are friendly and the service was very good. The food was good, a wide variety of things to choose from. My favourite meal was breakfast! The waffles were really good.",positive
"Went there with high hopes to re-live the great stay I once had in one of their sister hotels, Heritance Kandalama, but this Ahungalla has failed to match that quality... This was the annual trip of my work place Leapset, but since my wife also joined and I spent most of my time with her, I'm opting the type of visit as ""Couples"" here. First of all, it's a good hotel in terms of services, location, spaciousness and specially the friendliness of the staff. With the long duration of its existence, so have they matured with the experience on how to satisfy us visitors. Couple of excellent swimming pools, amusement area, beach volleyball, animators for kids and many more can be found if you stretch your eyes a little wider... Room was pretty good, complete and detailed, apart from the absence of some toothpaste which is quite common even in a 4 star hotel but not to be found in this 5 star. Also noticeable the rich mini bar with lots of varieties in average prices. About the food, variation was high but something was missing, maybe the taste or maybe the magic I tasted at Kandalama. The main restaurant has a nice, calm lighting theme at night however. With all this ups and downs, it has been standing a tall on that elegant beach for so long now, that it badly in need of a mass renovation. Signs of corrosion due to the salty winds sprayed by the beautiful Indian Ocean all throughout the year, are still visible even after some paint jobs. The notice on the door that opens to the balcony facing the sea front, requesting the visitors the keep the door shut to avoid this corrosion suggests that the hotel management is also hit hard by this. Let the corrosion apart, majority of the hotel premises look old now. So unless a full renovation and some restructuring happens soon, the legacy of this remarkable hotel might not live longer...",positive
"Had an awesome 5 days with my family.. great food.. warm sea baths.. it was really heavenly. Bit over priced in my opinion, and beaches are a bit crowded. but we were there in a very busy time period. Room service is great and the rooms are pretty clean. One of the best options to vacation in the south.",positive
"The location is good right on the beach but that's about it. The sprawling property has no charm, no grace, it's actually disgraceful. The service is pathetic. There is only one elevator servicing each wing and reaching your room is nothing short of a long uninteresting walk. The lobby lights are off at night and we literally had to walk in the torch light of the mobile phone when we had to leave at dawn for the whale watching tour. The spa treatments are an eye wash. The food is so lousy there is no sense of any combinations also the main course is served in a bright white light area if chef fin dishes that are broken and it feels like eating at a very low budget wedding or a college canteen. The last night was my husband's birthday and I had even offered to pay for a good cake, but my agent assured that it had been arranged free. It was one of the worst cakes that looked like it had been bought from the cheapest bakery in town. The common area toilets were so filthy I dreaded going there more than once. The key card that was issued to me was in someone else's name. Just about everything was bad about this property. I wonder how they have procured a licence to operate as a 5 Star. I do not recommend it to anybody at all! When the staff came to know that we were upset, they wouldn't leave us alone at breakfast and created an unnatural fuss. I found that extremely unprofessional. One of the staff members asked me what the problem was and after I shared all the grievances with her at the end of the conversation she actually said ""wish you a good stay Ms. Natu "" what should I call that? Deliberate or really dumb? If they don't get their act together soon, I guarantee that they will have to close down in the next couple of years!",negative
"It was a very nice honeymoon vacation we had so much fun, the beach was beautiful, and the service was perfect ❤️❤️❤️The chef was very helpful with us 😊😊 If we have an other vacation we will come here again 😍😍😍",positive
"This is our second visit here after four years. Absolutely love it. Looking forward to spend another holiday with the kids soon. Service is good, beach is awesome, food was good, the pool was spacious and we'll designed. The rooms were pretty neat too. I just had one tiny problem the waffles were not done because the waffle maker seemed to have a problem . I felt bad for the cook. He had so many requests too. But overall-loved it! Hope to come again if we get a good deal.",positive

"We stopped on our trip from Colombo to Galle, it's a bit of miles more but it's worth. Just the view on the swimming pool and the beach when you arrive is worth actually!

Most welcoming greeting for us this holiday. The staff were warm friendly and even upgraded our room. There were two pools so if you want more privacy you can use the second which is in a quieter more secluded area. The buffet was a varied spread of western and local cuisine and a special thank you to sanjaya our waiter who was so helpful and brought us tasty extras. We had a relaxing time in our room wwhich had a double bath rain shower and was very spacious. Decor was also luxurious and it definitely had the comfort factor with our own balcony over looking the beach. And most of all thank you to Shanika who gave us a great deal an looked after us during our stay.,positive
We had a lovely holiday at Heritance Ahungalla with my family. Staff and the service was excellent.food was delicious. Specialy I should mention about the wesak programme.

Had a lovely family holiday. The two pools are awesome and so relaxing. The children loved spending time at the pool. Must mention the excellent service by room boy indrajeet. Also the sous chef Dananjaya went out of his way to make us happy. Would recommend amyone to come and stay here.,positive

Experience at the night club was great. Customer service is great. Worthy visit.",positive
"My cousin and I had a wonderful stay at this resort . We feel that a special mention must be made about the staff at Heritance Ahungalla . Never have we seen staff at a resort or hotel who were so attentive to your every need . One truly outstanding person , is Kusum , who works at the restaurant The Jute ...... What an amazing person ! He was so attentive to everyone 's needs . You did not have to wait long for anything you needed . When we were eating the most delicious "" appoms"" with our fingers , Kusum was there with a finger bowl for our messy fingers 😄....even before we could ask for one . He remembers little details like the hot tea that we always end our meals with and brings it to us even without us asking , just at the right time ... Kusum always had a beautiful smile for everyone at the restaurant . Chef Roshan was another person who impressed us , he heard that we were eager to eat a certain type of fish and he took the trouble to check with his kitchen staff to see if he had the fish as he wanted to cook it specially for us . I have never seen any place like this , where the chefs all come out during meal times , smiling and greeting their guests . We will be back and one of the main reasons will be because of the fantastic staff that 's at Heritance Anhungalla.",positive

The hotel is in a distance which is not too far and not too close to Colombo. A place to visit if you are a sea food lover. The view from the third floor is one of the best you could get.

From the moemnt we arrived, we were able to relax and enjoy the stunning surroundings, designed by one of Sri Lanka's top arichitects, Geoffrey Bawa. The staff were always friendly and helpful, quick to respond and unfailinging polite. They took great care of us. We particularly enjoyed the gorgeous pools as well as the local beach.

"Hands-on managed, all Heritance Hotel Ahungalla staff are attentive, courteous, friendly, service-oriented and smiling. We felt at home (away-from-home), comfortable, safe and welcome during our stay. We are a family of five with a teenage daughter and two pre-teen sons (12 and 10). We had two adjacent spacious pool & sea view rooms at one end of the property on full-board basis. The on-duty chefs and catering staff (at the buffet restaurant) were always keen to ensure the dietary needs of our vegan daughter and plain - hamburger / hot-dog & fries - younger son were met; and moreover enthusiastically introduced us to Sri Lankan fruits and dishes. Surprisingly to us, the cooking staff regularly participate in international competition and the Head Chef has most recently won best chef at a competition in Europe! Heritance Hotel Ahungalla is a perfect choice for those looking for a hassle-free and quiet, couples or family holiday in a lushly landscaped, sea-view Sri Lankan First Class property. Our family enjoyed a memorable holiday there :) Thanks to the GM and all staff, now our friends!",positive
"We visited the hotel in April with my husband and small son.As we entered to the hotel we were warmly welcome by the infinity pool with very own heritance traditions and three different types of fresh juices also.Fortunately we could have a room within 10 minutes, even we didn't reserve our rooms earlier.It was fast when considering to the other hotels in Sri Lanka.We were guided by Ms.Supuni to the room and she explained us everything in the hotel with giving the maximum definition to the hospitality. Later my husband wanted to see the green pool even we were not allowed to use it because we were just for the day use. Again we were guided by Ms.Supuni and she explained the history of the hotel that we wanted to know. My son was very happy during the stay because he used to get lollipops when he needed. Food was awesome and I think there is no other place to compete with.Credits to chefs!Our room was cleaned and comfortable although we got a room nearby the spa. We have visited many hotels in Sri Lanka but never felt a hospitality as in Heritance-Ahungalla. Staff is very friendly and always supportive to the best of it. My son was very upset to leave the hotel and we couldn't extend our stay due to overbooked situation. Miss.Supuni is a credit to your hotel and definitely we will be back to feel the hospitality again to this beautiful hotel.Highly recommended for everyone!",positive

My self andd my husband with our family's came down for the weekend.and from the time we stept in the hospitality and the amazing friendliness from the staff was amazing. food was good and had a great time in the pool rooms we clean and comfortable . and we would definitely come again keep up the good work.and who ever who has not visited plzz do :),positive
"Very good service and hospitality, lovely view and friendly and helpful staff. Lovely place to have a good holiday, food is also nice. Room is clean. This is was our third visit. we will be back again. thanks",positive
They are very friendly because they ask your needs and fulfil it. Jacuzzi is really comfortable and fun. I had lost my sun glass and they helped me find it and I finally found it. The food is EXCELLENT!,positive
Rooms were superb with great facilities and food was great... Had a nice view of the beach and I think it's the best place to enjoy a walk on the beach as well as a swim in the large swimming pool.........,positive
"All the staff were friendly and helpful. Nice atmosphere, clean rooms & tasty food. The only thing was they said there will not be a buffet since it was an off season weekday but there was a buffet on that day and a la carte dessert menu. it was a bit confusing. Anyways it was worth the money. And we got a complementary yummy cake since we went there to celebrate a birthday :)",positive
"Beautiful location, beautiful architecture, beautiful setting, beautiful weather, beautiful food, beautiful staff. Honeymoon part 1 a great success now on to Heritance Kandalama......................................................",positive

Fantastic stay. Staff couldn't do enough for us. This was our Honeymoon and they made it very special for us. Recommend a massage if you can. Food very good......Everywhere very clean.....room very nice....,positive
"From the moment you arrive, you are treated as though you are the only guest and nothing is too much trouble. The hotel is in the perfect position, with the the warm sea a few metres away, and with pools surrounded by beautiful tropical gardens that team with wildlife, this is as close to paradise as you can get. Having been lucky to stay in some of the most exotic places in the world this is up with all of them. John & Barbara - England",positive
"My family & I had a great stay at the hotel, very friendly staff and great atmosphere. Enjoyed every bit of the weekend stay. Definitely will be back for more. Thank you all for a wonderful experience",positive
"We really enjoyed our stay in the Heritance Ahungalla Hotel and fully recommend this place to everyone. The hotel is situated directly at the nice beach, where just another restaurant and hotel is, so the beach is calm and not crowded, which is beautiful! The two pools are clean and very nice. The outside area is natural with a good atmosphere! All (!) the staff was always that friendly and worked with the full heart, they supported us in any questions we had. We thank you for your kindness, love and happiness! And we will come back to Sri Lanka and surely also to the Heritance Group! With the best for you, Vera & Patrizia",positive
Just stayed for some drinks on the way to Galle on our trip from Colombo. Magical place and a grand entrance with stunning view over the pooö and the ocean. Very nice staff and they tokk good care of us even if we wasnt over night guests. This is a must for our next time in Sri Lanka for sure.,positive
"As you enter Heritance Hotel, you are treated to a spectacular view of a massive pool and an expanse of Indian ocean. We arrived very late at night but the staff were excellent, a quick check in, accompanied by some piping hot Sri Lankan tea. Our room was nice without being outstanding and did not have a sea view. Would recommend that you ask for one. We were on half board, so dinner included _ a good decision since not too many good restaurants work walking distance. Food, both breakfast and dinner were adequate. The chocolate mousse being the stand out. Staff and the overall hotel were very kid friendly and the beach being at our doorstep was amazing. Slightly better housekeeping and some facility for basic watersports like boogie boards would have been useful. Go: with kids or in a group Don't go: if you are looking for a top end five star experience",positive
"After starting our holiday at the heritance hotel kandalama we didnt think it could get better. We travelled around for 2 weeks and wanted to end our trip relaxing by the beach. We booked this because of the good service we had at the kandalama. This hotel has got amazing views, great amenities and attention to detail. David one of the managers gave us a warm welcome and upgraded us to a suite with a cake and fruit basket arriving in the room as well as rose petals on the bed. After 2 nights we enquired about a room with a view, our suite was great but we wanted to see the sunset from our balcony on our last night. David was great he swapped our room to one with an amazing view of the sea and infinity pool, food was great and the staff couldnt be more accomodating, would definitely recommend a stay here",positive
"The service in this hotel is spectacular. Filled with warm smiling faces of the staff and the sweet aroma of cinnamon surrounding. The view is amazing from the first step and has the best first impression by far of all the Heritance hotels. Especially I would like to mention Dinusha and Sachini from the front office, as they were very helpful with information and other requests of ours. The restaurant hostess were very well trained especially during the busy times, always working with a smile. The food is also exceptional and A big thanks to the talented chefs who created the meals. To end I say that Heritance Ahungalla is second to none! We hope to return very soon!",positive

This would be my 6th stay and what keeps me returning is the atmosphere altogether. Friendly and accommodating staff and good food is always a good combination. Hope the quality will be maintained in the future!,positive
We had a super holiday at Heritance Ahungalla. They have two huge beautiful pools. The beach is just 100 yards away. The buffet is an endless variety of food and desserts. Very friendly and attentive staff. Kids had a great time too.,positive
Myself and my girl friend had a lovely time at heritance ahungalla.staff and the service is excellent.food was fabulouse.room service was given twice a day..and clean comfortable room.towel decorations were so adorable.,positive
"The Wandering Yank here again. We spent 5 days here at the end of our tour of Sri Lanka, and we had a wonderful time. The facilities are beautiful. It's a low-rise building almost hidden in the trees just back from the gorgeous beach. The lobby and Mirror Bar are open air and served well by sea breezes. The immense main infinity pool is the centerpiece of the building. Service was excellent, as we enjoyed everywhere else in Sri Lanka. The restaurant food was okay, not spectacular, at the breakfast and dinner buffets. We also ate at the Mustard cafe and the fine dining restaurant, which we thought had the best food. I particularly appreciated the clove-scented elevator :) We spent a number of hours in the little-used 3rd-floor library. There was a selection of paperbacks and old magazines (multiple languages), but best of all were the comfortable chairs with excellent views of the beach. It was a very relaxing 5 days at the end of our often tiring journey throughout Sri Lanka, and like I said, it fit the bill!",positive
We stayed at this hotel for two nights at the end of 3 weeks touring Sri Lanka. We really enjoyed the beach and lovely swimming pools. Our room was average directly above the main restaurant with a very hard bed we asked staff to it a mattress topper which they did but was not really any better the second night. We We're woken up very early one morning by room service but had not placed an order Breakfast wAs more like a cafeteria this hotel is very popular with the locals and they obviously have very different standards to us they love a Buffett which is exactly what we don't want. This is supposed to be a five star hotel and they certainly charge accordingly but they are not providing five star service or food More expensive for two coffees Than in Melbourne we did not eat any other meals at this hotel we went out to local restaurants recommend jungle Beach 10 min walk turn left at the beach Heritance need to have a look at there food and in particular the price of water prices $100 US for dining on the beach without drinks and the food is just not good enough standard The staff were friendly and pleasant at all times we found this at all Aitken Spence hotels,negative
We stayed at room 327. Superb room . We had an excellent stay. Front office staff very good. Specially Shanika. Nice family retreat. Exceed expectations. ...thumbs up!. Will come back again. ...beach is fantastic with the pool.... kids enjoyed. ...,positive
"This was the last stage of our April Holidays where we chose Heritance Hotels for our stay. First Kandalama and the last day at Ahungalla. The hotel is spacious and has good food and amenities, and is very family friendly. The staff especially the reception and restaurant staff were helpful when they met our needs. We'll be back! 👍",positive
"Had a variety of food and fantastic taste. staff was very friendly typical of Sri Lanka, magnificent hotel with pool and beach made the stay memorable and exciting. This hotel wil be on top of my list for another visit.",positive
"We visited Hotel Heritance Ahungalla for our 5th wedding anniverssary and was mesmerized by The true beauty of the surrounding, the structure and the friendliness of the staff throughout The holiday.for the 4th time we came to the Heritance hotel with 20 of our relatives to celebrate Avurudu (srilankan traditional festival) on the 14th April 2015, and spent 2 days and had the Best time of our lives.superb service, clean and luxury rooms, delicious food, and didn't feel That we were away from home.super friendly staff and they were eager to help us at anytime. Mr.Thushara the food and beverage manager was extremely helpful at all times and made sure That everything went well.we would like to thank Mr.Thushara and his staff specially for the Superb service rendered,and we would be visiting hotel Heritance Ahungalla very soon.",positive
We had a excellent stay at ahungalla with my family and we really enjoyed the aurudu holiday. It was realy nice.Exceed expectations. Definitly will be back again. Feel like home. Staff and the service is excellent.,positive
"I have stayed here with my daughter. We have had a wonderful holiday at the end of my 3 month stay here in Sri Lanka. It's a perfect place for anyone of any age from anywhere. The food is excellent, there is so much choice. I have tasted the best hoppers & string hoppers in Sri Lanka here! Service is excellent. The room is always spotlessly clean & arranged, regardless of how messy we have left it! The staff are always smiling & approachable. The swimming pool very clean & well maintained- suitable for swimmers of any age & ability. The pools have shallow enough areas for non swimmers to be comfortable in the pools also. The beach in front of the hotel is clean & beautiful, as well safe for sea bathing (as per the advice from the lifeguards). The greenery that the hotel is set in is very calming. There is plenty of space to relax around the pool & the beach. For even more stress relief & relaxation, the therapists at the Spa are brilliant & we will pay another visit when we retun here. Highly recommended. No negative comments to write. We shall definitely be returning when we are next in Sri Lanka 😃",positive
"My mother & I visited on a 2 day break whilst in Sri Lanka. We have been thoroughly spoiled during our stay here. The food has been absolutely delicious & the service excellent. We have eaten the best hoppers in Sri Lanka! Even my mother, who is extremely discerning in her culinary opinions was dazzled by the food here- that is no mean feat!! The staff are extremely friendly & cannot do enough to make your stay as comfortable as possible. The rooms are spacious & we had a beautiful sea view. There are 2 swimming pools, one of which is quiet & has a jacuzzi. The proximity of the hotel to the beach is an additional benefit as the beach is very soft sand & perfect to have a sea bath. Overall a delectable & relaxing experience which I would recommend both to those who use this as a destination hotel & those who wish to use the hotel as a base to explore the south west coast.",positive
"This is the place to be if you are a sun, beach and food person with a quite environment. I travelled with my kids and my BIL's family and they had a great outing. They have two pools and a jacuzzi . we preferred the one which is hidden from the entrance. the food was great and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Guaranteed, you will not be disappointed with your stay here.",positive
"we were here just before Sihnala new year. this is a nice spacious place with a nice long beach, two swimming pools (green pools which is the second pool is for in house guests only, which is a more convenient arrangement). In room facilities are very good and reminds me Heritance Kandalama. Staff is so friendly and need to tell that their service is better than most of the other places that i have stayed recently. Even with large number of people staying during these two days (including Prime minister of Sri Lanka), staff offered a great service. Food (especially breakfast) had a great verity, however i don't rank food as the top positives of this place. But that doesn't mean food is bad. (this can be a more Sri Lankan view) when selecting a room, if possible ask for a sea facing room (directly). all in all it is been a great stay..",positive
"One of the best places in the island. Talking about the staff: awesome, friendly and is a homely place. Rooms are of good quality and the place it's located. We stayed here for two days and enjoyed alot. Prices are reasonable as a five star hotel and I would recommend it to anyone first of all. We've been here for the past six to seven years when ever possible and had good times. Entertainment is at its best and recommended to anyone.",positive
Decided to stay over at Ahungalla for my birthday with the family. The Management & Staff had made every effort to make us feel special. Arrangements in the room and the very charm birthday celebration done by the restaurant staff without disturbing the other guests was a surprise. Everyone was very friendly and helpful as usual and specially the people who knew us as frequent visitors. Never felt that we were away from home. Will be back soon.,positive
"Facilities marvellous. Avurudu games were really good. avurudu food was really nice. Had fun at the pool . The beach was really nice. Lovely views. Organised lovely traditional food , shows and games. Restaurant food was great.",positive
"Me and my husband had an amazing honeymoon in Heritance Ahumgalla. Apart from the good food, clean rooms and friendly staff....what I loved the most about this place was its location. I love beaches and if given a choice, I would happily spend my life on one. And Ahungalla beach is breathtaking! I want to specifically appreciate the breakfast buffet. It has a wide spectrum of things and you get confused as to what type of breakfast you want. We really enjoyed eating dinner by the beach. Although I suggest that you can slightly improve upon the cocktails you serve. Also, different menu on different days (for the beach dinner) would also not be a bad idea :-) But, to summerize, our stay in Heritance Ahungalla was memorable one. We will definitely visit them again.",positive
We have very good time with our holy day and good aura du u the awaya and the beach are very good and clean also the staff are very nice us and the food are very good and we get halal food tx...................,positive
"Awesome experience, kids had a lovely time..... The avurudu programs were lovely, well organized.....would love to come back. Thank you for everything...!hopefully we'd get come back around avurudu season.... Enjoyed the beach too.",positive
"We had a relaxing and unforgettable 3 days, from the almost personalised service to the high quality food and the enjoyable new year activities, we didn't even need to leave the hotel. This is a must visit resort and one of the best in the country.",positive
My son who is 9 years old tells me it's the best hotel he has been to. He is a big traveller eventhough he is 9 (about 20 in srilanka and 3 abroad). We all loved the food and the staff. There was one staff Thushara who was always being at the restaurant and checking the wellbeing of the guest. I have to give him credit because he made the hotel experience even better for us. All in all its one of the best hotels in srilanka and in the best in South coast I visited. Room was super spacious (luxuary).. staff was super polite and helpful. .. food was amazing with a wide range. Keep up the good work !!!,positive
"We had a week there in April. Weather was great, hotel staff were polite and helpful, however some were perhaps a little too obvious in their hope for a tip or two. Food was very good and couldn't be better located for the beach. Beach hawkers, although were kept off the hotel property, were a little keen on (noisey) trying to attract your attention despite making it clear purchasing a top/skirt/hat etc wasn't going to happen!",positive
"The staff there is very friendly, they serve very nice food, but the service is sometimes not that good. Our rooms (319, 323) were quite nice, and very clean. (Special thanks to kularatha from the house keeping) Especially the dining at the beach was very delicious and beautiful. Thank you :)",positive
"Great service, very friendly staff,clean and neat, great beach, Great sunset view, Good food, good music, recomended for relaxation Really not to be missed Go there at the end of your tour for couple of days",positive
"Lovely hotel! Very clean and extremely friendly staff. Great food, quite quiet-which makes for a very relaxing holiday, if that's what you're looking for!! This sea is ok for swimming if you're careful. Overall we would highly recommend!!!!!",positive
"We stayed here as part of our honeymoon for 7 nights. Overall a very good stay and a very good hotel. The grounds are lovely - there is a really nice 'open' feel to the hotel. It is a very quiet hotel, which was perfect for us as we wanted to just relax but if you want nightlife this probably isn't for you - however they do provide some entertainment in the evening. The two pools are good, very clean. Situated on the beach....no one really uses the beach (which is unusual)! The sea was great fun.... huge waves but also a very strong current so be careful.Sunbeds were really spread out, which we really liked - made a change not to be right next to loads of other people - however we were having to get up at 7am to get sunbeds and more importantly an umbrella. I think there needs to be more umbrellas available as there is not much shade around- and the option of shade is vital!! Rooms were good. Spacious and clean. Cleaned everyday and our room attenedant was lovely- always leaving flowers for us. Food was of good quality - lots of choice and the desserts were amazing! We went all inclusive, however I would not recommend going all inclusive. We have been to many all inclusives and found this hotel lacking in choice - this mainly refers to the drink options, there was quite a lot restrictions and not much choice. I was quite disappointed that you could only have wine at dinner and unfortunately that wasn't 'free flowing'! You would definitely be better off going full board (for the lovely food) and then buying the drinks as you go!! The hotel is in quite a secluded area - so most day trips are a full day so worth bearing in mind when planning. Also we were keen to go on the whale watching trip but it only happens once a week and was fully booked so maybe plan early to avoid disappointment. Free WIFI available and is high speed internet...nice bonus. All round a great trip - would return again!",positive
"We spent 10 nice days at the Heritance Ahungalla in april 2015. To summarize, the stay was in general a good one. The setting is wonderful indeed. Spectacular beach. Great weather. The hotel as such is not bad at all. However, given the fact that it is supposed to be on the upper end, and that is has been designated the title Travelers Choice, we expected a lot more. This is more like a mid-range family resort. The good: Wonderful surroundings, sea view from the balcony, tasteful spacious rooms with a well-regulated AC. Great breakfast. Pretty good food quality in general. Friendly service. The headwaiter acted very professionally and listen very carefully and arranged adjustments when we complained about the buffé dinner. The Bad: Dinner is a Buffé, served in an environment reminding you of an elementary school. Let us say - not very cozy. They brag about their fine dining restaurant, which serves excellent lobster (hence, you should go there once) at a quite high price, but the rest is nothing special. Expect €40-50 for a bottle of wine anywhere in the hotel. It is a family resort. Some days the pool area is crowed with screaming kinds, despite that pool rules say: NO GAMES. The staff does nothing to moderate. Between the hotel and the beach there is an area with palms and bushes. In the shade, a dozen or so sales men and women do their best to attract the attention of the guests all day long. Hello, hello! Our plane departed late so our travel agent suggested that we should ask for a late check out. Initially the response sounded as if that most likely could be arranged, but somehow the hotel was fully booked on the Monday morning when we should leave, so we had to leave the room and take the shower in a cramped public shower with no shower gel and no space to leave your belongings. That was the end of a glamorous holiday. Well, maybe not. Suggestions to management: 1. Dinner: Try to do something about the elementary school dining room. Serve the Buffé twice at 19 and then again at 20:30. Make sure that the food is fresh all the time. 2. Mixing families and couples: You have two pools. Why not enforce strict quiet behaviour at either pool and let the kids play at the other. Everyone will be happy. 3. Public showering facilities: It is warm. People are the for swimming. Make sure they can take a shower in a respectable bathroom before they say goodbye. It will be the last impression they take with them back home as they say Au revoir.",neutral
We have visited Sri Lanka 10 times and stayed in really lovely hotels but have never revisited any but this year we are going back to the Heritance because it really was the best .Staff could not do enough to make our stay perfect Special thanks to Pasindu who always seemed to know what we wanted and when which must be difficult when the hotel is busy Looking forward to the great food great service and know we will have a great holiday,positive
"Pristine beaches to pool, so much fun and relaxing for my husband, 3 year old daughter and parents. The rooms were beautiful and the staff were all accommodating. The buffets were awesome too. Nothing bad to say, all great! Loved it. Wish I stayed longer than one night.",positive
My stay at the hotel was for 2 weeks and was absolutely beautiful the rooms are spacious and always clean the staff are so friendly and very helpful. The beach is clean and private. Definitely would recommend :),positive
"Awesome service, clean rooms and staff was really helpful. We got a larger room than the original one we requested.Food was excellent too and they have a wide variety of buffet items. Had an awesome stay. Good value for money",positive
"We spent one week in this hotel (B&B only). The hotel is built in a minimalistic style that I liked very much and has a great swimmingpool. The rooms were clean and neat. After several reviews on this site on the condition of the rooms, I can only say that to us they looked very modern. We are in the middle of choosing a new bathroom and what we saw here is what we had seen at home as being very much op-to-date. After 4 days they needed our room for a groupbooking and we were upgraded to an even bigger room! The people were very friendly, no problem getting a sunbed and towels. The food was good, all kinds of snacks during the day. We have not seen any people in the Upper Room restaurant, the Jute Restaurant was for the buffets, so we had dinner in the Mustard coffee shop 3 times, which was very good although a limited choice. When you go out on the beach, turn right and after a 5 min. walk you will find the Sunshine Restaurant, where we had dinner 4 nights in a row. Fresh fish from the grill with a delicious salad and fried rice. Together with a bottle of wine for some 5000 Rs (half of it for the wine). We read about people on the beach selling tours (Charli, Sunil and others). They try to catch you on the first day, so you have not had time to compare with others. Where Charli would charge you 8000 Rs for a trip to Galle, we had Manu (from the Sunshine Restaurant) who has a tuktuk and is a licensed guide and driver. He took us on a tour to Galle for only 2.500 Rs! We also did the river safari with Manu. He is a very friendly guy and not so pushy as the guys on the beach......",positive
"We stayed on route to Australia 20th . 26th Dec . it was the worst Xmas ever. It poured with rain , the hotel was supposed to be a 5 star but really no more than 2 star. The only good point is the staff and they tried their best to please us . but the bottom line is the dismal grotty rooms the gray plaster bathrooms poor quality towels , generally grubby. The main restaurant is dark brown , noisy scraping chairs, dingy, grotty. The food caters for the sri Lankans/ Indians not Europeans . I got a bad tummy that stayed with me for two weeks. I could write a book about all the horrid aspects of this hotel but suffice it to say Don't Go .",negative
"Originally designed by Geoffery Bawa this is a hotel with impact. Beautiful pool areas and superb setting. The staff are always polite and friendly - always ready with a smile and going out of their way to assist. When booking a room be sure to state if you want a double rather than a twin. This hotel codes 'double' as twin beds positioned next to each other. So for a shared bed you need to request a 'king size' upon booking. A small irritating change of descriptor that lead to many a confusion and many a room change request I'm sure. The rooms are of a good size with brilliant en suites - great power showers. We had a large balcony - more of a terrace which was perfect for a g&t as the sun went down. We were on an all-inclusive package eating from the main restaurant each meal whilst in the hotel. Whilst I am never a fan of buffet style dining the quality and range of good was astounding. Always a fab selection of salads and local fruits as well as everything in between. We sampled do many new local dishes - one chef even cooking a new dish to try especially for me! If however it's Mediterranean/English fare you fancy whilst in the tropics, well then too you will not be disappointed. There were always about eight non-local dishes and about the same of Sri Lankan. Plus - if you're still peckish - a dizzying array of desserts. We arrived out of school holiday season and both pools were perfect for working off all that food, or pootling about in. On the last days of our stay however considerably more families arrived which made the pools, whilst beautiful, a little impractical for a full hotel. Whilst Western standard five star this certainly is not, overall it's a fine all inclusive offering.",positive
"Wow, this hotel is fantastic if you want to chill out and watch the world go by then this is the place to do so. The staff are very attentive going out of their way to ensure everything is ok for you. We were only booked on a B&B package, AI would have been better as there is very little outside of the hotel in terms of restaurants and bars. We did enquire about upgrading to AI but was too pricey for our appetite & would have restricted meals to the buffet option & we much prefer a menu choice. One of the chefs invited us for a tour of the kitchens, cleanliness was top notch & we really enjoyed seeing the food art studio ( chocolate & butter carvings were absolutely awesome). The waiters & waitresses remember you & what you drink, they have lovely genuine natures always ready with a warm smile. The pool attendants are there straight away in the morning setting up a lounger with towel wherever you want it. Breakfast buffet caters for every taste ( waffles, egg hoppers & fruit selection are out of this world). At no time did we feel like the hotel was overcrowded, always beds available,room to swim in one of the pools and tables in the restaurants. The sea has a strong undercurrent so always take care not to go out of your depth. As is usual in this part of the world you get the beach hawkers, they are only trying to make a living and are gracious when you say thanks but no. All in all a fantastic week with nothing but praise to amazing staff in a fab hotel!",positive
"Very nice rooms, staff really attentiv and friendly! Choice of food is good and specially the sri lanka menues are excellent!! Complete service is good.the beach is very beautiful and clean. Nice place to relax and we want to come back again.",positive
"I think sri lanka is a wunderful country and this is a very nice hotel. The stuff is very very friendly! Thank you! The pool and the view on the beach is amazing. Also the rooms are quite pretty. But i felt really stressed as soon as i went near to the beach. You couldnt enjoy for some minutes, there were always some people who tried to sell you some stuff. That wasnt okay and the hotel shouldnt accept that.",neutral
We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights first of all we asked for a sea view room and they told us that they will upgrade us to a suite with a sea and pool view wich made our stay. The property is nice clean and unique .it has 2 pools. The main pool is located in the heart of the hotel with a close distance to the sea . The beach is clean and the rooms are good and well air conditioned. The food is good but a little pricey. The staff are friendly and well trained we will definitely be back.,positive
Our family enjoyed the stay and loved the facility... The staff is very courteous and friendly... Food awesome... Pool and the beach exotic... We would love to be back .... 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍,positive
We stayed here for 12 days and we don't wanted to go back home - what more can a holiday stand for? The staff is very friendly and always helping when there are questions. The food is soo good that we probably have to go on a diet now ;) There is so much to eat and so many new things to try... I also really liked the atmosphere during earth hour with all the candles and the fire show. Many thanks go to all the staff and we will always remenber the nice tour in the kitchen! Furthermore I want to thank the life guards and the animator for bringing me back savely to the beach after loosing the sand under my feet due to the current!! :) We enjoyed our stay here and we will be coming back for sure! Thank you so much for our great holidays here!,positive
I am a seasoned traveller and get to see the good the bad and the ugly of the hotel world. I can honestly say that this is one of the best hotels I have stayed in. It is perfect for a relaxing holiday spot. The staff are always smiling and are genuinely enthusiastic about making sure you are happy and contented. They clearly have great pride in their nation and its culture and are more than happy to inform you of anything you want to know. I would recommend this place to anyone seeking a quiet tranquil break as a couple or as a family.,positive
"We stayed at Heritance Ahungalla for our honeymoon. After travelling the country and staying in several different hotels, we can honestly say that Heritance Ahungalla is the best in every way. The rooms, the service, the food and the amazing private beach is something we will never forget. Thanks to KK and Thushara for making our stay so memorable!",positive
"Stayed 3 nights this stay and despite checking in at 1pm was welcomed with a friendly smile and great service, even at that time of the morning. Service at this hotel is always flawless and am looking forward to a 3rd visit in the future. The room was amazing, with a beautiful view of the ocean and staff kept it clean everyday. The 2 pools are great, the food is always delicious and breakfast buffet has a good selection of quality food and the freshly made egg hoppers are yum.",positive
"I appreciate the steps heritance ahungulla is taking to save planet earth. The breath taking programme stirred my senses. The hotel is really awesome in its service, ambience and beauty. The idea of the beach adjoining the swimming pool is really greattt.",positive
"One of the best hotels in Sri Lanka, directly leading to the beach with a large and beautiful swimming pool. The buffet is also quite amazing with a variety of meals. The staff are very good and kind who are always supporting the guests even with questions indrectly about the hotel and also very efficient. A very good place to stay and relax also near places with Portugese Historical Heritage. This is the 12th time I have been here, even when the name was Triton.",positive
"Staying with my family at the Heritance for two weeks, the delightful atmosphere will always be remembered. A highlight of our stay was the astonishing show for the Earth Hour. I was asked by the very friendly personnel and artists to participate in their performance which was an unforgettable experience for me. Thank you very much for the wonderful evening!",positive
"Very beautiful Hotel next to the sea where you can hangout on the beach os on the large swimming pool. The Service is very good and the buffet good. Small remark concerning the room which was a bit dirty when we arrive, but the staff was very professional and reactive to order a new room cleaning which made everything alright! I recommend!",positive
"My fiancé and I returned to this hotel following a stay in 2011. We enjoyed our time spent here and combined a visit to Ella and a stay in a guest house in Kosgoda. We would agree with other reviews that the hotel is in need of updating, however we heard that they are closing the hotel next year for improvements. Having said that, the rooms are fine and all areas are very clean (just quite tired). The service and hospitality is very good and friendly, the bar staff, pool/sunbed staff and especially the lovely man we had cleaning the room (Asoka), we saw him every day and he always went over and above, asking if there was anything he can do or anyway he could improve our room. We actually asked to change rooms as we weren't happy with the view from our first balcony (it overlooked the pool and we wanted something a little more private) and within 30 minutes a new room that suited us was ready. The pool area and garden are beautifully maintained and we loved our time spent around the pool overlooking beautiful Ahungalla beach. We stayed on a B&B basis as we enjoy eating outside of the hotel and there are lovely places to do this; the two beach restaurants just a 5 minute walk from the hotel (jungle restaurant and sunshine restaurant), a beautiful restaurant in the next town along (sankarest garden restaurant, a 5 minute tuk tuk ride at 250 rps). There are also other restaurants in Bentota but this is slightly further afield, 20 minute tuk tuk journey at c. 700 rps (depending on how you haggle). We went to tutle hatchery whilst there and a boat trip, both very worthwhile doing. As previously said, the beach is beautiful and very quiet however, I would be interested to see how it changes once the 500 room (vs. heritance 140) hotel next door is completed in two years time. As other reviews have said, you do get a bit of hassle from the beach sellers however this didn't bother us to much and seemed to die down after a couple of days of saying 'no'. We did book a boat trip through a nice guy called Charli who we'd met and had trips with in 2011, you can find him on the beach and ask any of the sellers for him as they all know each other. We would have liked to have taken the opportunity to hire bikes from the hotel but the weather was just to hot during our stay for either of us to have wanted to do this! Overall we really enjoyed our stay at heritance.",neutral
we spend 10 days in this lovely Hotel. The Service was very good and the meals extremely delicious. We never had meals at this high Level in a Hotel before. The property conditions are as well but you can see that the building is an old one. It is a good Place for relaxing and swimming in the waves.,positive
"Me and my husband stayed here for 13 nights in March 2015. We are quite well travelled and this holiday, by far, has been our absolute best! The hotel, the staff, the service, the ambience and Sri Lanka in general... We just fell in love. I'm an avid TripAdvisor user (I'm a travel agent) and after reading some reviews I did become slightly nervous about choosing the Heritance Ahungalla as our All Inclusive hotel. This is going to be a long one... The transfer wasn't too bad from Colombo airport. We booked our transfers privately and using the new Toll road the journey took just over 2 hours. As soon as we arrived at the Heritance we were taken to a seating area near the pool bar for refreshments and check in. The check in was super speedy and we were escorted to our room and its amenities were also pointed out to us which was very helpful and informative. We were in room 218 which is located above the Jute restaurant. You would of thought there would be a lot of noise or cooking smells coming up to our room, but not a thing. I didn't even realise our room was above the main restaurant until a couple of days in when we got our bearings. The view was lovely as we were overlooking the sea and gardens. The room was pretty great inside too. We did get 2 large single beds pushed together which in a way, was good as we could stretch out a little (I like my space! Haha). The lighting in the room wasn't the best at night when your trying to put makeup on, but no big deal, used the bathroom instead. I was quite happy with the room decor, the bathroom maybe could of done with a lick of paint, but the actual bathroom suit was fantastic! The rainfall shower was just divine! There was never a shortage of hot water either, no matter what time of day. We booked the All Inclusive package at the hotel which is well worth every penny! The food we sampled on our holiday has been excellent throughout. We didn't really sample the A La Carte restaurants as we were quite happy with the food and service in the main Buffett restaurant, Jute. The food choice sometimes was repeated a couple of nights, but there is so much choice that it didn't really matter. Plenty of other foods to try. I particularly liked Friday evenings as they did Chinese elements, lovely! The drinks included in the All Inclusive were pretty good too. I would of liked to of seen maybe more choice in the available cocktails, maybe the hotel should think about offering a 'cocktail of the day' just to mix it up a little. The hotel offers beach dining too in the evenings. We decided to give it a try and book it, boy was it delicious! We were waiter served for 2.5 hours and the food was just mouth watering! My husband had the Lobster and I had the steak, simply brilliant! It was so lovely with how they set the tables with lantern lights and the sound of crashing waves a few meters away. Definitely recommend you book it! Just before we had dessert the Sous Chef Roshan Pujitha came to our table to introduce himself and also offered us a kitchen tour after our meal which we accepted! It was really interesting as he also showed us the awards the hotel and its chefs have collected over the years. The hand made chocolates (which I honestly thought were Guylian Belgian Chocolate) were incredibly good! Roshan showed us how they made them, they are that good! Thank you Roshan for taking the time to come and see us throughout our stay too. At the start of our holiday we had the absolute pleasure of meeting Kumara (KK) the assistant restaurant manager, who simply went above and beyond. My husband is a Type 1 diabetic and KK went out of his way to accommodate his dietary needs. Most hotels do this yes, but KK was very generous in accommodating his needs. Thank you KK for everything you did, you made our holiday and it was absolutely lovely meeting you, you are an absolute asset to the Heritance company! The pools are just fabulous! We chose to use The Infinity pool during our stay which was awesome. The water was pretty warm and not cold at all either, which was nice. Most of the pool is waist height but there is a 'deep end' which is signposted with a water buoy. The beach hawkers aren't that bad actually. The couple of times we did set foot on the sand they did jump on us, but I found if you were polite and simply said no thank you, they left you alone. There is a guy on the beach, Tino, who offers day trips. We never used him as we pre booked our trips before arriving in Sri Lanka, but some other hotel guests recommended him and when I did speak to him, his prices did sound pretty good, and he'll take you where ever you want, easy. At the end of our holiday we decided to take a hotel run trip to the fishing harbour near Bentota. It was an early morning start obviously at 05:30 but we were back at 07:30 so wasn't too bad. We were escorted by M.Nuwan and chef Lakshan. This wasn't really something I wanted to do, but my husband did. I am so so glad I went though, it was fantastic! It certainly exceeded my expectations anyway! We were taken through the hustle and bustle of the harbour, shown all the different varieties of fish that had just come in etc. We got to choose some fish too which Chef Lakshan said he would give us a cooking class later in the day and we would have it for lunch! We got 4-5 fish altogether and at midday, we met Lakshan in the Mustard Cafe and he took us back into the kitchens and supplied us with chefs hats and aprons! The cooking class lasted 20-30 minutes and we were then seated back in the Mustard Cafe were Lakshan waited on us with a 4 course meal including the fish we had earlier bought and prepared. After the meal Lakshan and the executive Chef Kasun Premachandra came to see us at our table and said we could have the remaining fish for our evening meal if we wished. So again, in the evening, in the Jute restaurant, Lakshan prepared our food and served us again. Thank you so much Lakshan for the absolutely fantastic food and the experience! Apologies for such an in depth review but we loved our holiday and the hotel, I really wanted to share our experience. Thank you so so much to all the above mentioned, you really made our trip special and we will see you all again in August when we return!",positive
"Stayed 5 nights this stay and despite checking in at 3am was welcomed with a friendly smile and great service, even at that time of the morning. Service at this hotel is always flawless and am looking forward to a 4th visit in the future. The room was amazing, with a beautiful view of the ocean and staff kept it clean everyday. The 2 pools are great, the food is always delicious and breakfast buffet has a good selection of quality food and the freshly made egg hoppers are yum. Had a few drinks at the Pool bar, Wall bar and Apollo bar and staff were always friendly and smiling. I would like to specially thank Lakshitha, Kusum, Sudesh, Dayal and Chandra for amazing service, although service from everyone in the hotel is always fantastic, even from the cashier Nihal when i was checking out. I am always sad to leave this hotel. My only small disappointment this stay was from one of the staff (Bell Boy). A Sri Lankan friend came in to meet me for dinner in the hotel around 7.30pm on 12th March. We were walking into the foyer of the hotel and the Bell Boy ran up and interogated my friend in Sinhalese on what they were doing here. I was most embarrassed and spent most of dinner apologising to my friend for this bad experience. I unfortunately did not get this staff members name. Needless to say we had an amazing dinner after this incident with great service again. It was the only poor experience i have encountered in the 3 stays at the hotel. The other Bell Boys have always provided great service.",positive
"Stay here for two weeks We have a great stay .the best is the staff very polite always smile Even the service can bee a little slow sometimes. The garden and the swimming pool are just great . The Room are outdated and cleaning could be better, but we have a nice guy take well care of us . Breakfast is good a lot of choice.we enyou ours in the shadow outside .The dining room are dark. I will recommend the hotel for the surrounding.",positive
"My wife, me and granddaughter wanted to enjoy in January sunny weather and swimming in the sea. Hotel itself has big rooms comfortable rooms and excellent, polite staff. At that time the beach is practically empty, you will definitely enjoy the sea, its waves and the beach. The place itself is quite, hotel level is 4 stars, the food average, after a few days you would like to change restaurant but practically nothing is in the walking distance. You have to take taxi or tuk tuk . If you want to make a few trips around the Sri Lanka I recommend to start with 3-5 days tour around the island and than finish at the seaside. Just a few miles drive last very long because of heavy traffic so for the trip you have to start early morning (4-5AM) and you will finish late night.",positive
"This hotel stay was good stay; it was convenient booking; then 100Kms away from colombo warm welcome; faster check-in, good explanation of available amenities lovely morning beach.. good pool; good for kids not so deep very good food; and courtesy of staff; faster check out. mostly they had baby cots and baby chairs at restaurant; Badminton, tennis, pool, billiard, carom, table tennis were available; and quite helpful staff improvements would be; [Room:212] telephone showers are not available in deluxe rooms. washing kids is not so easy. its a good idea to have a proper & Secure place for parking. rooms are not very new; your kid may wake-up as the wooden floor sounds as you walk. no good lighting inside the room. its only two bedside lights and a table light; all are covered and focused. Bed was two combined single beds with separate mettresses",neutral
"Stayed at the hesitance as a base for our two week stay in sri lanka. The hotel itself was lovely, the staff were amazing and really helpful. It's also really close (10 minute yuk yuk) to Ambalangoda where you can easily get trains for about 50p (sterling) to Galle and Colombo etc. The breakfast is fantastic with a great range of dishes and the two pools are both equally lovely with the guests only 'green pool' providing plenty of privacy and quirt (although the main pool was hardly noisy). Right on the beach and a lowly breeze blowing through all day. Great for both couples and families.",positive
"The Hotel is a wonderfull design by Jeffrey Bewa, beautiful details made me feel special. Rooms are nice, the pool area very big with seaview and withe sandy beach. The stuff is alwaya friendly and helpfull. The kitchen was great we really enjoied our time. Super wifi",positive
"We were at Heritance Ahungalla last weekend and were treated like VIP""S ! Special mention is made about - the staff - extremely courteous and friendly, without exception ie from reception to the restaurant. Special mention is made of Gamini Wijetunge, Head of F & B and his Assistant, Thushara, who went the extra mile to make our short stay memorable.l The food was superb - the buffet was fantastic, be it breakfast , Lunch or Dinner... - what a spread !! - Also the rooms are well designed, ( plenty of power outlets to charge phones, IPads and laptops) comfy beds, clean linen and towels,and of course, we were pampered with a fruit basket in our room !. The bathroom was large, with a rain shower and a bathtub, specially the Luxury Room we were in. This review is not complete without a special mention about the infinity pool . Lovely view of the Ocean,,and although the pool is massive , you can wade in - safe for kids - with a specially demarcated deep end area and the the hotel looks like a fairyland in the night from the pool side... Thank you all, for the wonderful stay. We will come back ! Ranjit and Kuveni Wijeratne",negative
"My husband and I spent 2 days in this stunning venue. As soon as I entered the reception I was taken back by the stunning view of the pool and beach.The rooms were clean and very modern. The rooms were refreshed twice a day by friendly staff. The food was amazing had a good selection. Plenty of meat,fish and vegetables served day and night. Extremely friendly staff who looked after us during our stay. We spent most of our time in the green pool and the beautiful beech. Felt relaxed and already looking forward to going back thee again.",positive
"One of the main reasons why we had an exellent stay in the hotel was the the extremly friendly staff. In particular we would like to name: Indika Gonawela, Pahan and Susil Also we would like to mention the variety of food.",positive
"Hotels entrance and lobby is very good. Amazing ambience of reception part but unfortunately unexpected rooms. Horrible the first day when we checked inn the room. Room was in a very bad condition. After a fight with front desk got a new room but next day. That was better but not upto the mark. Bad news for vegetarian indian food lovers ""No much choice"". But yes for any indian veg food requirement in the restaurant there is 1 very helpfull person available i.e. MR. Praveen. He supported us a lot and arranged very good veg indian food for us for all 2 days. Thanks a lot to him again. Overall our stay was very good. Beach , Swimming Pool, Jacuzzi etc etc. This hotel needs a renovation very badly.",neutral
Had 3 lovely days at heritance ahungalle with my husband and 2 kids. Friendly staff and great service. The food was amazing and the rooms were cozy. The kids loved the pool and the beach. Great hotel for a family get away. Relaxing and loved the staff. Especially My 5 years old daughter who commented how lovely the lady staff members were :)) thank you for a great holiday!,positive
"Night club was awsome. And great customer service by Lakshitha, Shanika and the staff. Silent pool was very chiling. Buffet is also great. Lovely sea side location and view of the beach. Calm and quiet place.",positive

"During a recent trip to Sri Lanka, my Travel agent suggested the Heritance Ahungala hotel. As a frequent traveller, I have stayed in many hotels around the world and consider myself as an expert of hospitality industry and customer service. I trully liked the hotel, the hard working and dedicated staff. There were few small issues, that I brought to the management attention. I received an immediate responce from the management to my feedback. I appreciate the hotel's management dedication to customer service and their ability to solve the problems immediately. I may consider Heritance Ahungala in case if I decide to go back to Sri Lanka.",positive
"The hotel and pool area is absolutely stunning. I couldn’t stop staring from the main lobby over the pool to the ocean. Gorgeious. Not much around the hotel – couple of restaurants nearby and very small “town.” Wish there were more places to walk to – but you’re pretty much stuck with the hotel/resort itself unless you have a driver. Pools were great. Ocean was very nice too – but unfortunately we found we couldn’t really enjoy the beach at all b/c we were constantly harassed by local restaurant owners trying to get us to go eat at their restaurants. Used to hawkers throughout SE Asia – but these guys just wouldn’t go away/stop. We ended up simply avoiding the beach and staying at the pool – which was unfortunate b/c the ocean/beach were beautiful. Not sure what the hotel can do about this – but it definitely would be a reason we wouldn’t go back. With that said, breakfast was good. The Fine Dining Restaurant was fantastic – although we were one of only two tables the night we ate there – which seemed a bit odd. Found out there was an activity director on our last night there – things like volleyball for example. Wish we had known that earlier – we would have enjoyed that – hotel needs to do a better job of informing guests of activities going on. Music in the bar at night was a bit amateur – but fun and cheesy. Native dance presentation one night was spectacular – but again we just happened to be down there by happenchance b/c we didn’t see where it was advertised. Overall – if you’re looking for a quiet, upscale beach resort and just hanging out at the pool – this is a perfect place. If you’re looking for more than that – I’d recommend trying Bentota or Hikkaduwa instead.",positive
"Set away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life, this hotel was magnificent. It served superb food which had plenty of vegetarian choices. The staff were welcoming and professional. The pool was lovely and blended in with the gardens. A most enjoyable stay.",positive
"Travelled with my boyfriend to this hotel about a year ago, it is very far from the airport but Sri Lanka's such a beautiful and exciting country there's enough to see from the car that you don't get bored! Although their driving is so crazy compared to british roads we didn't see any crashes, only near misses thankfully. It was our first time in Asia and this hotel was perfect and definitely has the wow factor when you arrive. You're greeted with a drink and a cold towel which is nice after sitting in a car for hours and when jet lagged. The hotel itself is massive and we were on the first floor, I can't remember the room number, but we had a balcony and could just about see the sea over the trees. The room was spotless and a lot bigger than we were expecting with an inside seating area with mini bar and lots of storage space for our clothes. The grounds are amazing too, with the massive pool overlooking the beach and sea and then the other more secluded pool which was a bit quieter, with so much wildlife to see including water monitors and chipmunks! The pool attendants did a very good job of keeping both areas clean and tidy and making sure all the sun beds were clean. We thought the food was very good all round, both the dinner, lunch and breakfast buffets had a massive and varied choice with something to suit every taste from curry to salad and soup. It was sometimes quite difficult to get tea/coffee in the morning as you had to wait for them to come round and ask, but aside from that the service was good, especially considering how many tables their were. We ate in the a la carte restaurant on our final night and the food was AMAZING with massive portions, I would definitely recommend it. The staff were all incredibly friendly and they worked so so hard with us seeing pretty much the same staff everyday for our 12 night stay, and they were still all constantly smiling. We only had a slight issue with a few members not wanting us to pay as we went and would rather us put everything on our room but once we explained most were cooperative. Overall, we would love to stay here again it is the perfect relaxing holiday destination with also lots to see and do and we would recommend it to anyone!",positive
"mixed feeling about this hotel. the hotel grounds are beautiful, the pools and the beach are great but the building itself and the rooms are kind of old. the staff are helpful and it had a good breakfast spread. the main issue was the toilet as there was a weird mold or sewer smell",neutral
"I went to Heritance for my wife's bday. The welcome was good and we were ushered to our suite, which was very spacious. We didn't use the outdoor facilities so cannot comment on that but all seems to be in place and the other guests seem to enjoy. There were many restaurants and they even arranged a dinner outside on the beach for my wife's bday but unfortunately we couldn't experience the same, as there was a drizzle but the thought was just amazing. They advised on what we should do there and we visited the Turtle Hatchery and we got a chance to release more than 85 baby turtles! Now that was an experience of a lifetime!! My wife was thrilled!!! All in all, excellent rooms, good food and great service. This is my second visit and I would certainly return.",positive
"A very nicely run hotel where all the staff are fully committed to serving the guests rather than maximise their income! As vegetarians, their catering staff went out of their way to make our stay very pleasant.",positive
A very nice and romantic place for couples .. The perfect for relax and swimmIng.. The music played in the lobbyis similar to the arabic music which is good and made me feel like iam in my country.. Iam sooo happy that i chose it for the last two days of my visiting to stilanka,positive
"Facilities are excellent, Beautiful and safe beach to enjoy any time. Sun down is a sight to be seen while having drink in Swimming pool. Staff members are so friendly, Specially the reception manager Shanika and her crew did a wonderful job there. When it comes to food, very clean, so delicious and the restaurant manager and crew always willing to help you with smile. It would be a crime if I didn't mention the hard work of pool attendance in both swimming pools. They keep those two places so clean and tidy, happy to help with moving chairs as you wish and the lad who worked near the jacuzzi in last Saturday, even clean it for me just because I wanted to use it late and it was little bit dirty. Hope the management appreciate his work for me. I'll be back again in my next visit for sure.",positive
Room is superb.food is exclusive. All expectations are very high. Both swimming pools are clean and very comfortable. Evening music is perfect and nice place to relax. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Specially shanika and kasun at the reception.Unfortunately we were lost luggages at the airport. but the hotel reception staff helped us to bring our luggages back. Atmosphere is very good and safety feeling. We would like recommend to anyone who like to have relaxing holiday in Sri lanka. This is unforgettable holiday and We will definitely come back.,positive
"Spent a few nights here before heading home - fabulous beach location. Pool is amazing and great views out to sea. Staff really helpful and attentive. Rooms a little tired in places but some appeared to be being refurbished so may not be an issue going forward. Lunch menu in the cafe was ok, main meals were in the buffet restaurant (all inclusive) but choice sometimes felt limited e.g. Salad selection however breakfast was always plentiful.",positive
"We are not common to visit a hotel twice, so three times would normally be out of the question. For Heritance Ahungalla we gladly make an exception. The personel treats us as friends for being repeaters. A perfect hotel for a VIP feeling.",positive
"We spent three weeks visiting Sri Lanka for the first time & had been touring for the first two weeks round the island. When we arrived at the Heritance we were ready to relax which was exactly what we did. Turning off the busy coastal road there was an immediate sense of calm & we particularly enjoyed the Bawa architecture which suits the climate so well. We had been upgraded to a suite which was fabulous so my husband spent most of the five days on the balcony overlooking the gardens, pool & beach. He was in seventh heaven & I could relax by the pool which was a good size for swimming. (This was not the pool by the entrance which is also lovely. Having two there was always plenty of space for everyone to swim & cool off.) We were on half board & found the buffet selection very comprehensive as we were happy to sample the local diet. If you wanted something less spicy there were always alternatives & it was a great treat to eat outside most of the time. Everyone looked after us & there was always a cheery greeting & a smile. We left feeling completely chilled with some great photos to remind ourselves how laid back we were.",positive
We travelled to the Heritance for a 3 night stay we had previously been to the Hotel twelve years before when it was called the Triton so we were worried that it would not have been as good as our previous experience - we needn't have worried it was better. We went BB rather than all inclusive and chose to eat in both the Ala carte and fine dining restaurants - both were lovely but the Ala Carte seemed to provide better value for money with a wider choice and catered for children. The staff in the restaurants were all attentive to our requirements (including the chefs who were fantastic in providing for my wife who as a glutton allergy) and genuinely ready to chat which added that personnel touch which adds that special extra to the holiday. Our room was superb - suite with all appropriate mod cons and the cleaner (Thilma I hope I have the name right) he was extremely decent and helpful throughout our stay. There are two pools the main one with the fishing boat is a focal point of the Hotel and the beach is lovely however the waves can be quite strong. The Heritance has a special significance for our family and was fantastic and when (not if) we return to Sri Lanka we will certainly be booking the Heritance once more.,positive
"Arrive on 23 rd with average expectation. The weather forecast was bad, I just want to relax. From the first step the staff was friendly and helpfull. We had the luggage in t he room before we arive after the wellcome drink and refreshing towel. Big room, excellent matress, perfect shower and tube. Front view to the great garden and ocean. Food for everibody from vegans to curry lovers. Good wine and desert. The bar offering lovely cocktails and snaks. Great smile on everibody's face from the reception to the housekeeper. Btw they did cleaning everytime you went outside. So 100% recommendation. You must be here.",positive
"We stayed for 5 nights at the Heritance as part of our honeymoon trip. We stayed in a superior room with ocean views, and stayed as a half board. On arrival it is clear that this has the Geoffrey Bawa style architecture, with trees incorporated into the design of the hotel, and a nice transition between outdoors and indoors. It has 3 restaurants, if on half board that gives you access to the buffet restaurant for breakfast/supper only, there is also an a la carte restaurant, and a fine dining restaurant. Very impressive swimming pool that is next to the lobby on arrival, very friendly staff that greet you, and happy to help with any queries or organising trips for you. Nice room, that was always well cleaned by staff. Positives: 1. Staff - extremely courteous and friendly - excellent customer service. 2. The pool- the pool is a large pool that is in the centre of the hotel, with good views to the sea. 3. food - we only ate in the Buffett restaurant - but there was a large range of options so there was also something for everyone to eat. Themed nights throughout the week were a good idea. Negatives: 1. Hawkers on the beach - although not too obtrusive, a bit annoying as anytime you wanted to dip a toe in the sea they would pester you a bit. Can understand why they are there, but can be a little wearisome after a while.",positive
"I am currently staying at this hotel with my husband, friends and grown up children. Yesterday my husband and myself celebrated 25 years of marriage by renewing our wedding vows. It was an exceptionally organised and beautiful experience. The staff at the hotel went out of their way to ensure we had a fabulous day. The hotel guest relations executive Shanika Jayaseaara not only organised the day for us but assisted in the arrangements needed so our grown up children could come out for our renewal,managing to keep it a complete surprise. She was very attentive to our every need. The beach was beautifully decorated, the drummers and dancers were fantastic and Shanika herself officiated the ceremony.It was lovely to have someone who was not only professional but also very friendly overseeing the ceremony. Shanika also arranged for us to have a tree planting ceremony. This was not included in the vow renewal package, she just thought it would be an additional thing we would like. Again showing the exceptional service provided by Shanika and the hotel. It was also our friends 10th wedding anniversary at the beginning of our holiday. Shanika and the hotel staff decorated our table at dinner with flowers and provided a lovely cake. The restaurant staff paid extra special attention to our friends again providing an exceptional service. We still have 7 days of our holiday left and I can truthfully say we are all looking forward to every moment.",positive
"We stayed at this hotel for five days from the 13-18 February, in a superior room, on the ground floor overlooking the gardens with a partial sea view. From arrival it was apparent that the room had a stale smell that had been unsuccessfully masked by the cleaning staff using cloves to hide the odour.In general terms the rooms are large,although extremely outdated by the original 1980's décor. Limited attempts have been made to upgrade the bathroom by the replacement of the original sanitary ware. Although bare plaster,binding door,pop-up wastes that do not seal negate part of this exercise. The restaurant prides itself on the training of its Chefs,although has considerable difficulties in balancing the menu to provide a mixture between eastern and western food.There is little provision for some travellers who may not want to eat Sri Lankan food for the whole of their holidays. This was mentioned on more than one occasion to the Assistant Sous Chef,and The Sous Chef,who provided a detailed tour of the Kitchen,although no indication why the menu is so one sided. The restaurant is open between 7-10 pm,when we arrived at 8.30 pm most of the salad trays where empty and had not been replaced. The one European dish,pasta, had two spoonfuls of ""penna"" left in the tray. When we queried this with the Assistant Sous Chef he asked what we would like to eat?,and this could be prepared for us.I also noted that many of the dessert trays where empty and would be withdrawn and not replaced,normally at 8.45pm. At this time the restaurant is open for a further 1Hours and 15 minutes. I really would expect better from a 4*-5* hotel.",neutral
"We booked our holiday in aid of 2 special events, our wedding anniversary and our friends wanted to renew their vows celebrating 25 years of marriage. In the run up to the holiday we contacted their Guest Relations Executive a Shanika Jayasekara who really was fantastic. Shanika went above and beyond to make sure both events were very special, we had room upgrades and these were right by the green pool which was our preferred room location, our rooms were made available for an early check in and this was quick and hassle free with a welcoming drink and cold face towels. On the day of our anniversary we were made to feel very special and given a cake in the evening and our table was decorated beautifully with flowers. As a surprise for our friends renewing their vows we had arranged for their grown up children to fly out for the ceremony and to join us for the rest of the holiday, Shanika was able to allocate them a room next to ours and help hide them until the ceremony. The vow renewal was a very special event indeed with drummers, dancers and an elephant, the way the hotel and especially Shanika organise these events is perfect, they really do think of everything which means we were able to just sit back and enjoy every minute of their special day. The package price was very reasonable and included a 5 course meal on the beach in the evening, with a cake. The hotel itself has the friendliest staff who really want to ensure you have a fantastic time, we are still here at the moment but felt we had to write a review sooner rather than later to let everyone know what a fantastic hotel this is. The food is very good and always something to choose to meet our tastes and if not the chef will happily cook something especially for you, we chose to eat outside in the garden area which was quieter than the main restaurant and lit beautifully with lanterns. The pool attendants made sure we had 7 sunbeds in the gardens right between our rooms and the green pool which was beautifully quiet with rarely more than 5 people in it at any one time. The beach sellers are not pushy if you are firm with them, we were able to relax on the beach without much disturbance. There are other members of staff who deserve mentioning but unfortunately while writing this I do not have their names at hand, however I will endeavour to write an addition review to this at the end of the holiday when I have their names and can give a final update.",positive
My family has been at this hotell 4 times and we will defenetly return. Because you can feel the staffs teamwork and that they allways put you in the best mood. This is our favorite hotell at Sri Lanka and we know because we have stayed at several hotells thrue the years. The beach and the pool is lovely. The food is faboluse. /Pia,positive
"We spent time at Ahungalla for the fourth time in 5 years. We didnt got disapointed, the hotel and its staff delivered, as usual. Every year we travel around on Sri Lanka and stop by 5-7 hotel, this time 5 hotel. The Atmosphere and everyhing is perfect. The building is starting to get old but still we like it a lot, there is only one Bawa. The staff has a special working-spirit. Yo can feel that they are enjoing and work as a good big team. By now almost every one know about us and they always give a big smile and perfect service. We have experience from many Sri Lankan hotel and at this Place the staff is the best. /Patrik We are alredy planning for next visit.",positive
"We are two couples that have a lot of experience traveling together and visiting many cities around the globe. This hotel is known as luxury hotel,but is not!!! You can not have a relaxed dinner because it's SO noisy , it was a kind of a violent experience. The room is nice but far from being clean. Don't try!",negative
Exellent staff members. Quality foods. We went on a very busy day though it was very busy the Front office staff members took care of us as we are the only guest inhouse. Very old hotel but its not an issue. we enjoyed alot.,positive
"Turning in from the frenetic activity of the Sri Lankan roads into the peace and tranquility of this hotel was priceless, as is the ""wow"" first view through reception to the pool and sea beyond. We arrived absurdly early in the morning and were VERY grateful for being permitted to check in several hours before normal as well as being allocated a lovely quiet room, though it must have been at the end of the plumbing run, as the hot water took an age to reach the shower! Loved the furnishings in the room. Though the bathroom was a little tatty, everything worked and it was clean. Our policy of selecting our preferred ""hawker"" early in the holiday worked well. Patmi (spelling?) arranged a tuk-tuk to take us into town for bottles of coke (to do with the duty free!) and extra water for our room and we called in at the turtle hatchery en-route; he then arranged and came along on our Madhu River trip and priced up and provided our whale watching from Mirissa (at £95 per couple, less than half the price suggested by our local agent for the same standard of boat etc). As we had already ""adopted"" him, we were not bothered by any other ""tour"" hawkers. Of the sarong sellers, the guy (Indika?) offered by far the best prices - while the ladies turned quite nasty when they thought we had been comparing prices with other tourists! We booked B&B and quickly found the Sunshine restaurant (turn right along the beach) and also tried the White Villa (the smarter building) and the Thotupola behind. Of the three, we felt that While Villa was overpriced and they got our order wrong once, the other two are probably very similar in quality and price but we got into a habit of eating at Sunshine and always felt very welcome and looked after (a tuk-tuk to take us back during a thunderstorm). Dont be put off by the eclectic mix of furniture!! We were paying around £15-20 per meal for two, including beers. Wine was expensive (for Sri Lanka prices) though good and came in an ice bucket! All in all a lovely beach holiday and a great location.",positive
"This hotel's location is absolutely beautiful but the hotel rooms and after hours in -room dining are a real disappointment and are definitely not 5star worthy! However, the staff in the bar/ restaurant area are extremely helpful. I would definitely recommend to take their Romantic Dinner Set up on the beach which is extremely unique and a great menu. The peak of the hotel is the main swimming pool as it really is the focal point of the hotel. The pit of our stay is that we were not informed about anything during check in such as useful information like: you have the choice of enjoying your breakfast in your hotel room or the buffet concept restaurant & coffee and tea are complimentary during your stay (including in room dining orders!!!). All these points are great highlights which were not informed to us and we only found out by asking proactively asking questions or having the lovely surprise of not being charge for breakfast by in room dining. We really want to thank Front Desk Assistant Manager, Kansu (I think that's his name!) who looked after us during our stay and even surprised us by placing a happy anniversary cake in our suite. Overall, our stay was lovely but I feel that the hotel would benefit from a refurbishment as some areas of the hotel are a bit outdated or need a good clean up.",neutral
"This resort is very good! We can walk on the beach after dinner, and the staffs here are very kind, they just did their best to satisfy my requests! The buffets are also amazing! the swimming pool here are very clean and cool, they're so big and we can see the sea when you relax beside the pool. The bar is fantastic as well. By all means, this hotel is really recommenged!",positive
I stayed one night with my husband. Great place to relax. We both enjoyed the swimming pool. Second swimming pool is shady even in the mid day. Restaurant is great. Buffet was wonderful with variety of food. Staff is really nice and restaurant manager Thushara was out of the way to help. I wish they could provide some ironing facilities to rooms. Overall excellent hotel. Keep up the good work.,positive
"We have just returned from a fabulous holiday at the Heritance. This was our first visit to Sri Lanka and the stay at the hotel helped make it a memorable holiday. All the staff from the reception desk to the pool boys were so friendly and helpful. The hotel should be congratulated on their staff training programmes as it is clear they have an outstanding bunch of people. Holidays are all about people! We ate at all the different restaurants In the hotel and were treated to a great selection of well cooked local and western food. A special mention goes to the chef in the The Upper Room restaurant who made us feel so special - he even gave us a tour of the kitchens, amazing. We had a great room on the second floor overlooking the pool and we were able to hear the waves from the sea. The room was cleaned spotlessly every day with fresh towels twice a day and bedding changed frequently. Our recommendation is, go for an upper room with pool or sea view. We have noticed that some people complain about the guys on the beach selling gifts and trips, come on people, get a life, they are only trying to do a job and earn some money, if you are not interested, just be polite and say no thanks. Two pools, plenty of room to spread out, pool boys who looked after you and moved sunbeds into shade or sun! And of course the bar staff who kept you rehydrated!",positive
"This hotel has it almost all. It is located on a great sandy white beach with crystal clear water in a hot indian ocean. If has a great seimming pool - one of the nicest I know. actually, it has two great pools. The food is extremely good edpecially for those like me who might struggle with the spiciness of the local cuisine. The buffet offers a great choice of high quality dishes and the hotel also offers an a la carte restaurant and ... fine dining on the beach. The rooms are very comfy and all staff are very friendly and efficient. There are facilities such as a gym, snooker etc. I love this place and I am sad that I soon have to leave. Why ""almost"" perfect? Sea is great for bathing but no offers no opportunity for snorkling. But I knew that in advance. Hotel services - apart from wifi which is free - are a bit expensive. But still, this is a great hotel.",positive
So happy we had our wedding at heritance ahungalla.it was a lovely ceremony.our wedding planner shanika was brilliant and made sure everything went to plan.we were very happy to see our room had been upgraded to a suite as we are honeymooners.a big thank you to all the staff at the hotel especially pool bar staff who kept us topped up with drinks! Every meal we had was lovely with plenty of variation.little mention to charli(taxi/tour operator) on the beach a very helpful and nice man,positive
We have had 4 wunderfull days at Heritance Ahungalla with great experiences. Let me mention the most lovely Valantines Days Dinner at the beach last night which the staff had put a lot of work in to be fantastic. Yesterday the hotel also hosted 2 weddings at the beach with Sri Lankian dancers and elephant visit. The staff is extremely friendly and helpsome and the other night after a splendid dinner we were invited out in the kitchen to see all the Championship that the Chef had won and also their interesting chocolate factory. A hotel that we can give our warmest recommendation.,positive
"Married 14th Feb 2015 @ heritance ahungalla- amazing ceremony in an incredible location. We really wanted to get away from it all and have a nice beach wedding. Ceremony included drummers, singers, traditional sri Lankan blessings and a going away elephant. Incredible photos and memories! :) staff in hotel are very helpful and friendly and you fell very spoilt when you stay here. Food is excellent with good choice of both western and local cuisine. Highly recommended for anybody who would like a unique experience. Shanika was our wedding planner and made everything easy and stress free - which is perfect for anyone looking for a fuss free wedding.",positive
"Our last destination on a round tour ended here and it was the best by far. We really felt like this hotel was like a home away from home. Narmika was a very nice lady. Along with all the waiters and receptionists were very helpful. The food was excellent and like eating the heavens. Our room boy, Chaminda, was a delight and created amazingly funny animals. We also had an interesting tour of the kitchen and chocolate factory with the talented chefs to see some of their amazing carvings! Definitely can recommend this hotel for any couple or family!!",positive
"Service really good not a single issue about the service BUT The rooms - we booked 2 deluxe rooms one triple and double, as per my knowledge deluxe rooms should have a king sized bed not twin beds, im quite sure we were given superior rooms not deluxe and the third persons bed was a folding bed, which made our stay really uncomfortable, could not sleep all night. The funniest part...the shower cubicle was not enough for even one person. .. Very old and unsatisfying. .. Never going to any of the Aitken spence hotels ever... Must add...head office reservation lady was very un polite. ..don't remember her name. .. Overall - BIG NO NO NO",neutral
As part of our second leg of the management offsite we landed at the beautiful resort in Ahungalla in the serene nature midlands of Sri Lanka after a 3 hour drive from Colombo. The best view of the Ocean is the highlight of the hotel lobby which is spanning across a large space and gives an impressive view of the ocean...truly an ocean front hotel. Most of the visitors of the hotel were foreign nationals and the hotel was bustling as it was a weekend. The hotel has got very good rooms but they are too far from the lobby. There are traditional dance programs for the entertainment of the guests on the beach at night which is truly world class. The hotel has got a gym and the restaurant is huge. There are many small swimming pools and a jacuzzi alongside some of the rooms.,positive
"have just returned after two weeks at the heritance in AHUNGALLA.We had avery good holiday& the hotel staff were very friendly & helpfull.The only thing that let this hotel down was the rooms which are in dire need of refurbishment.The bathrooms have a half glazed screen with blinds which i found very odd.Some of the walls are finnished in a polished concrete effect , which might have been fashionable thirty years ago but not now.However i do not want to put people off this hotel because the rooms are still comfortable & functional. we found the food also very good with a good selection to suit all nationalitys.The service in the pool bar could be a little slow at times & we did feel that people who were not on all inclusive got a better service than people who were .The other down side to this hotel is the distance to the airport . This can take anything between two & three hours depending on the traffic & the time of day. To conclude i would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to my friends.",neutral
we had a nice week in this spacious hotel overlooking a lovely beach but unfortunately not suitable for swimming because of strong current and waves The hotel has no good concierge service which was a bit frustrating. The taxi service of the hotel is excellent with fixed price so no haggling The restaurant can be a bit busy and the tea service was not optimal however this was sorted out with good initiative by the excellent waiter Nilka. The pool bar was god and the waiters were very helpful. God swimming pool but can get noisy with many children,neutral
"We have holidayed in many different parts of the world, but our Sri Lankan holiday at the Ahungalla 'Heritance' Hotel stands out as one of the best. The location of the hotel next to the magnificent beach, it's beautifully laid out gardens, the views of the ocean, not to mention its superb cuisine are hard to beat. But what makes this hotel exceptional is the unfailing courtesy and friendliness of the staff who spare no time or effort to ensure that their guests are well looked after and that all their need are promptly met. Some of the staff deserve a special mention. To begin with: Roshan Pujitha (the magician of the kitchen); Dinusha (Assistant FOM); K. K. (Kumara) and Gamini, both responsible for the restaurant and bar; Pandita, Nihal, Sanjaya, Praveen (waiters); Supuni, Sachini and Shanika (members of the wonderfully helpful reception staff).",positive
"Booked this hotel as part of our tour of sri lanka , it was the last one having stayed in 4 other hotels .Recommended to us and overall it was a nice hotel but let it self down in certain areas. Arrival was pleasant and we had a slight delay before going to the room , which was very nice spacious but in need of some improvements . wardrobe doors did not close on the runners , blinds in the bathroom had no function to close them , did report to reception but nothing done . Pool area very nice always able to get a sun lounger two pools available and the attendants were first class in providing towels and arranging the beds for you . Staff in the restaurants and bar areas were also first class being both attentive and professional. Only down side the evening was based around the pool and i feel they need to provide a better more comfortable seating arrangement instead of the same seating for the daytime pool drinking and eating tables and chairs . food and drink was good with a good choice and selection . beach is lovely but quiet due to , beach sellers and men pushing their taxi business which disrupts the relaxing environment , they stay behind a line of flags but it is close to the sun loungers. overall this is a nice hotel and nice beach side location nothing outside the resort if you go B+B then you must eat in the hotel which can work out expensive . The let down for us was the last day , most flights out of sri lanka are late evening , we were due to be collected at 21.30 . The room had to be vacated at 12.00 ( no late room available ). At 12.00 which was embarassing a member of the reception team came and cut off the all inclusive bands when we were with other guests. this is the first hotel which stopped the all inclusive many hours before we left . also if you want that shower prior to departing then they wont provide a room , we had to shower in the pool shower which is also the toilet nowhere to hang clothes or dry your hair . this was a disappointment to me which let the experience of the hotel down and which in my opinion stopped it being classed as a 5 Star , the sri lankan people were great i will return again but not to this hotel , i did read the reviews and thought i could ignore the beach sellers but it did spoil it . couple in our 40's",neutral
Two nights at Heritance was definitely not enough. great food comfortable accommodation and just great location. The hotel was full due the been so close to christmas. Staff were busy however treated us all like we were the only customers. Great turn around from the previous time we visited when the hotel was called triton.,neutral
"A nice beach hotel to stay in. The staff are very friendly and helpful although when the restaurant is busy you may have to wait a bit. Special thanks to Nelka in the restaurant and Waruna 'The Captain' in the pool bar for their friendly approach and their help, especially in getting my green tea just the way I like it! There are some hawkers hovering around on the beach but, overall, they are not too troublesome.",positive
This hotel is a very nice place to stay. THe staff are very helpful. We were here for 2 nights after a tour around Sri lanka. All we wanted to do was relax. The meals in both restaurants were so nice including the buffets options. The pool is just beautiful spanning the length of the front facade. There is also another pool and a gym with a range of equipment. I must also mention that on the last day I became ill just before I was about to travel 20hours to go home. The staff were very helpful in caring for me and getting me the food and drink I needed to get to the airport and packing some supplies for my flight. THe manager spoke to me personally and made sure his staff very doing all they could to help. I would recommend this hotel to anybody who would like a relaxing hotel by the beach.,positive
"We stayed here for 11 nights and were really impressed with the consistently great service we received. The staff are such a credit, and they really look after you well. We loved the quality of the food, and the breakfast buffet was outstanding. The room was also good, with a lovely view of the sea. There were a few small problems with the room but nothing major. For example, we booked a double but got a twin room instead. Also our safe broke a few times, but this was always fixed promptly. The main disappointment was not really with the hotel but the beach area, and lack of life on the beach - except for pesky sellers. We didn't really understand why there were no sunbeds on the beach. So we made use of the pool areas which were great, but not quite as nice as the beach. Although you do get to see some of the lovely wildlife in the hotel garden... iguanas, squirrels and even black monkeys in a big tree just behind the hotel. We were really surprised by how much we were hassled and harassed by the local sellers... not a fault of the hotel, although they do get a bit close in the pool area, which can be a bit of a nuisance. Just a warning - the locals don't seem to appreciate that tourists want to relax and not be 'sold to' all the time! They always have a hidden agenda, and when you ask them to take you somewhere you want to go, they insist on stopping at rip-off tourist traps where they can earn extra commission. So be prepared to say NO a lot! If you are wanting to eat outside the hotel Hikkaduwa is good - it's a 40 min tuk tuk ride. You can haggle down to 1500 rupees return, but make sure you agree the price before you go or you could pay double - Even if you've used the same driver already!! Also, a great beach awaits you at Hikkaduwa... not the part of the beach where all the tuk tuks stop but a bit further along... just keep walking and you'll find a huge beach with surfers, plenty of bars and cafes, sunbeds etc. Beautiful! Shame we only discovered it on our last day!",positive
We really enjoyed our week on the beach haere after a tiour. Our room which was I think deluxe was great spacious with great views. The hotel is lovely and well located on the beach with two great pools. The staff were great and could not do enough. There is not much outside the hotel though my partner had great massage down the beach. Other negative points; the food is not brilliant in our view though others did not agree. We certainly did not think the fine dining was worth it. There are also not enough umbrellas on the beach and the lifeguards cannot but help disappoint some people. They did help us out but we were on the beach early. None of this stopped us having agreat week.,positive
"This is our third trip to heritance ahungalla and had a really poor customer service. First we had to wait for more than 15 minutes for our welcome drink since lot of foreigners arrived just AFTER us and had to remind 3 staff members. we went only for lunch buffet and while entering the dining hall our tickets were checked, but while we were dining one lady approached us and wanted to know our room number, so we told we are here only for lunch. Then she again wanted to see our tickets one by one while we were having lunch giving the impression we havent paid. we were amazed by this 5 star treatment. This not what we are expecting after paying Rs 3500 per adult. we will never come back to this place.",negative
"Our first trip to Sri Lanka and Heritance Ahungalla. Nice hotell located in an absolutely fabulous garden with a calm and relaxed atmosphere. Staff absolutely wonderful and always present. The rooms need a brush-up to deserve 4 / 5 stars. Local food ok, but international food was a bit tasteless with no spices at all. WiFi excellent. Long beach free of beds, but strong underwater currents raised the red flag every day. Pool area quite ok. Lots of local ""business men"" on the beach and some really noisy people selling clothes right ouside the hotel garden, but they all seemed very friendly. After some days we got used to them. A bit expensive to eat and drink. We recommend this hotel for grown ups seeking peace and relaxation, not for younger people seeking more action",positive
"Husband,myself & friends staying here after a 8 day tour on an all inc basis. Really lovely hotel with very friendly helpful staff. Great pools & good facilities. Normally stay in riu hotels & comparing All inc here very restrictive. Otherwise very nice.",positive
"My husband and I are seasoned travellers to Sri Lanka and the Indian sub-continent. We are just finishing a 4 week trip to probably one of the best hotels on the Island if you are looking for a beach holiday. Without exception all the staff are absolutely wonderful - if only we could 'bottle' their smile before returning to the UK? The management readily admit that they need to update the bedrooms and public areas of the hotel but this in no way detracts from the amazing stay you will have from the minute you arrive until the very last minute before you leave. All staff are worthy of mention but as we do not have room to name them all, 3 in particular will ensure your stay remains not just an experience but a long lasting memory (KK Restaurant Manager; Nihal Restaurant Supervisor and Saman (our houseboy for Room 102). The lifeguards at the poolside also deserve a mention; not all guests are easy to deal with but they remain polite and cheerful whatever the guest request! The hotel, originally designed by Geoffrey Bauer has pride of place on a wide, long stretch of sandy and 'sun bed free' beach. Part of me doesn't want to write this review and to share my holiday with you - the only reason being we don't want lots of people to spoil it!! So enjoy - you will not be disappointed and if you are wondering if we will return - of course!",positive
"I would recommend this hotel for The excellent set up, the great customer service that their staff provide from the front office staff to the room service staff to the waiters to the pool attendents all are very friendly and very helpful. I would specially like to thank Shanika from the front office she was very helpful to us during our stay here... They could really work on improving on the food spread found the choices available to be very limited... Other than this excellent in everyway",positive
"They say 'First Impressions are Important', and that is certainly true of the Ahungalla. From the first view through the open-plan lobby area and across the giant, inviting swimming pool to the beach and crashing waves of the Indian Ocean beyond...Wow ! The setting is magnificent on a long, wide sandy beach with little else there currently to disturb either you or the view. (another large hotel is under construction further along the 4km stretch). While the hotel is large in size, it is well designed so that blocks of rooms with their own balconies are positioned throughout the lush, beautifully-kept grounds where you can find a rich variety of tropical trees and plans. There are two large pools which are safer than the sea. There is a strong current and sudden drops in the sand close to the shore so beware. The hotel boasts an award-winning chef and a variety of restaurants. I can recommend the tasting menu on tables set-up beside flaming torches on the beach - definately try the local catch. The main breakfast room served an excellent variety of local produce, especially fruit, but it was slightly dark and I would recommend asking for a table to be set-up on the lawns outside. Two of the bars are air conditioned and I preferred the one on the terrace with views beyond the beautifully-lit pool to the Ocean. It is relaxed and the staff are engaging and efficient. Rooms are quiet, well-appointed, comfortable and bright with garden and ocean views - there are several suites. (Cricket lovers can ask for the Tendulhar suite where the Indian superstar stayed and containing some fascinating memorabilla). Cable TV, air-con, ceiling fans and, importantly, wi-fi all worked well. The local town is a short Tuk-Tuk ride with shops, bars and restaurants, all a little cheaper than the hotel and well worth a try if you are spending several days at the Ahungalla. Ask staff for recommendations. There is also an indpendently-run bar and restaurant at the end of the beach about 10-minutes walk from the hotel. While I was there on business, most were on holiday and seemed to be a mixture of those spending at least a week at the hotel and others seeking beach and sun at the end of a tour. Either way, it appeared hugely popular with guests praising the excellent staff, food and atmosphere.",positive

"This was our last hotel during a 10 day tour of Sri Lanka. We wanted to end the trip with two days at the beach to relax. The room was modern, clean, quiet and very comfortable. We loved swimming in the ocean. There were great waves for body surfing! The pool is also lovely and very sizable. I should note that food and drink was quite expensive at this hotel compared to the other places we stayed. Also there are locals at the beach that try to sell you stuff all day. If you are looking for a private beach, this is not the place for you. Although I will say most people didn't seem bothered by the sellers and most were buying from them. Overall had a nice stay.",positive
"One of the hotels that impressed us very well.staff were very freindly and helpful, Food was what impressed me. As muslims we were very particular about halal. The team had taken the effort the distinguish between vegetarian halal and non halal food.",positive
"We were in rooms 209 and 210. Pros: - well laid out and planned hotel - swimming pool area is beautiful - proximity to beach lovely Cons: - hardly any lights in room-very dim - run down - wifi not too great - very sparse room-not even a coffee table! - kettle had a calcified or corroded heating element so we did not want to take a chance with boiling water for our morning coffee. While it was well camouflaged, there was no plug point attached to the kettle so it would had to be physically moved near a plug point to operate-bad design. - bathroom has windows with only dusty, uneven Venetian blinds for so-called privacy - floor was dirty with dirt stuck on it - room was smelling musty when we came in. Couldn't leave balcony door open for too long to air, due to mosquitoes. - no room numbers written on key card envelopes-had to go out the door to check! - no in-hotel numbers written near the phone - cobwebs on balcony panels-rubber coming off - hotel information papers in the binder were not in order-pages missing. - no in-room menu in room. - checking in took time and we were shown a seating area that was impractical to sit in as sofas were not placed opposite of each other but next to each other. We stood around for about 10-15 mins and no one even asked us to take a seat at another more practical area which was close by. - the man showed us everything in the room but to omitted to show us the balcony! We could not see it as it had opaque sliding type panels that covered the sliding windows - the towels and sheets did not smell fresh - hardly any vegetarian options in the menu to warrant the money so the only options were a la carte in the coffee shop and that were going to take 45 mins to order. That hardly seems fair for vegetarians, does it? Since there was no other option, we ordered 3 western choices from this menu. Unfortunately, we were disappointed with the quality and taste of all the options. The veg lasagne had pasta that was chewy, the pasta primavera had peas that were raw and the potato and bean 'pie' was in fact not a pie at all-just potatoes, onions and beans topped with cheese! - The place needs a lot of maintenance.which it wasn't getting - staff need to improve their English, esp since there are so many non srilankans visiting-language was definitely a barrier esp when it came to ordering food. - staff need to be better trained to know what the hotel offers-boy who showed us to rooms said we could get a la carte in the dining hall. Instead there was only a buffet and no a la carte. - in our room, 210, we had no locking system in the door inside the room-no latch or knob, so ostensibly, the master key could be used to open the door at any time from the outside, even while we are inside the room - no tissues in tissue box in room 209-poor housekeeping - took 20 mins and reminding a few times to get our coffee at breakfast - took a long time for the dirty plates piled up from the buffet breakfast to be cleared. Had to point it out. Sadly, the cons far outweighed the pros. I would not stay here again unless it undergoes a major restructuring.",negative
"Located on a seclude part of the beach far away from the bustling town of Bentota. Rooms are big and fairly clean. Service is good. Food is good with large variety. Best part is the easy access to a long, large stretch of clean beach. 2 swimming pools. Very picturesque.",positive
"Whilst arriving at this hotel from our 5 days travelling across Sri Lanka we were greater with cold towels and refreshing drinks. The hotel has a very good vibe and very clean surroundings, the pool, beach and rooms are spotless 24/7. The beach staff are extremely helpful with beds and towels and you should never go unhappy with them around all the time. It became apparent that having a dinner on the beach is the most asked question, with 4 members of staff asking if we would like this in one day, for $80 per head it doesn't seem good value at all. Would come again but possibly for more of a stop off than long stay.",positive

"Ahungalla resort has a lovely seafront location and is nestled amongst lush green gardens. The rooms are large and nicely appointed. My husband and I had a 1st floor room which had a good sized balcony and nice views overlooking the garden pool. The food excellent and the breakfasts have a good variety of dishes to suit all tastes. WE particularly liked the excellent 24 hours restaurant for dinner, the food was sensational and the staff pleasant and friendly. If you feel the need to ""dress up"" for dinner, then the fine dining restaurant is very good. We were very impressed with the staff at this resort, everyone tried to do everything in their power to make the holiday one to remember. Coming back to the room after dinner each evening we were pleasantly surprised to find a ""towel art"" piece on the bed expertly created by the housekeeper. Especially liked the elephant. Ask the staff to show you through the ""Sir Cliff Richard Suite"" it is lovely - want to stay there next time we visit. Staff will organise a taxi if you want to visit Bentota or surrounds.",positive
"A good location because it is one of the best beaches closest to Colombo, and easily accessible from the highway. The beach is is wonderful! Not crowded at all. perfect water temperature and perfect sized waves for swimming and bogie boarding, The hotel itself is managed by Heritance, which is my opinion is the best luxury hotel chain in Sri Lanka (outside of colombo). So the food was delicious, the management was considerate, and more than enough service to go around. If you've in Colombo and looking for a short getaway, this is the perfect one.",positive
"The good first - Hotel staff are all wonderful, helpful and the service slow but very friendly. The beachfront location is excellent. The food is good- even the buffet - which I normally dislike with a vengeance was above average, but the fining dining experience (lobster) was excellent and the coffee shop a la carte was also very good. The main pool is fabulous and the other okay - but the Jacuzzi is dreadful - small, old and uninviting. The bad - oh dear!! The rooms are drab, dysfunctional and this was after 3 changes!! We arrived tired after a long drive from Kandy and were given a twin despite requesting a double - when we complained we were moved to a double and told this was an upgrade - despite it being exactly as the other but on a different floor! Complain again - as this was supposed to be a 5 star - and the room was very tired - and we were told that we could move the following day to a luxury suite but not until 5pm. Trying to be accommodating and not spoil a so far wonderful trip to Sri Lanka we agreed not to unpack and move rooms the following evening. But, three rooms later - okay this was larger - a very large separate, very stark work room - with a private balcony and wonderful views but the air conditioning didn't work in the bedroom, there were cigarette buts on the balcony and the shower (which my husband couldn't stand under - built for little people) leaked to wet the entire bathroom floor. However, the wonderful staff, sous chef, and just about everyone we met were so lovely we forgave everything. But this is NOT a luxury hotel!! Just a very standard hotel charging luxury prices and it will be interesting when the 501 roomed giant opens its doors next door to see if it survives. Oh and the ugly - the sunbeds are from the last century and the pool attendants who set them up very pushy for their tips.",neutral
"The Hotel is in a great setting on the beach. Yeah its a little tired in places, but we found it excellent. Staff were very friendly. The locals too friendly. As said before, you get constantly hastled by the leaches, sorry locals on the beach who want to sell you anything. Its a shame the hotel cant do more to address this. That said, i managed to get surfboard hire from one for afew days and we bought a couple of bitd to keep them from bay. The food is good, drink service a little slow, but overall, very good all in all.",positive
"Stayed here in January with family. Set amongst beautiful pools and gardens on the beach, this hotel has huge potential. This was our second stay here and felt service and maintenance of the property had slipped considerably. Room are large and well equipped though a little bit dated. The pool and gardens are kept well however buildings were in a need of paint and maintenance. The service and food in the main restaurant were the worst we experienced throughout our stay travelling throughout Sri lanka. Breakfast was a good spread with plenty of variety, getting a cup of coffee took time though, sadly dinner was the worst experience we have had through our travels, the food was just slapped on, we were there for three nights and for two of the three nights we encounted empty dishes when we were serving and this was not replaced for a considerable amount of time, there was more emphasis on western dishes and sadly not much choice. We found service to be very slow, dishes were not picked up when one had finished their meals and staff were not every efficient compared to all the other resorts we have stayed in and we did choose this hotel given the positive feed back that was left on past experience. Sadly we didnt think much of this hotel at all.",negative
"The entrance to this hotel will make u fall in love with the place. A pool at the entrance overlooking the beach. They have another pool on the inside. 3 restaurants, a fully functional gym, its just heaven.",positive
"We were only here one night and arrived mid afternoon, so we were not able to get a very comprehensive view of the property. Check in procedure was very slow, albeit they do bring you a drink and snacks and invite you to sit………….and sit……….…..and sit…………..and just when I was about to get up and enquire what was taking so long, they finally invited us to go to our room. There WERE a few people who arrived at once, but it really did take some considerable time, for reasons not clear to me Check out was also somewhat slow, and then getting summoned to an office behind reception makes you wonder what is going on NOW ? Has my card been declined, my visa an irregularity, am I wanted for something ? Turns out it’s just the cashiers office ! So why not just accept payment at the front desk like every other hotel in the world ? Room was fairly large, comfortable, and of a good standard, with everything one expects from a resort hotel. I particularly liked the sliding shutters, as opposed to curtains. Cesar Ritz said about an hotel needing 3 things - “position, position and position” and this property certainly has position ! Located right on the wide sandy clean beach, (not sure if one can swim from it) warm infinity pool reaching towards the sea. Palm trees, lawns, shady trees around the pool area – it’s the epitome of a beach resort hotel ! It’s a fairly large property too. The standard tourist trap shops selling souvenirs, but I suppose that’s to be expected ! The dinner buffet was of a good standard, and it was very pleasant to be seated in the warm night outside under the palms, on a lawn adjacent the beach, with lanterns for lighting – all very Polynesian Island stuff ! Food was of a good standard, though I found the drinks service a little slow, and slow to follow up. Yes, they were busy with a lot of people, but I often have cause to question whether that is in fact an excuse or not ? In general it’s often about having sufficient and well trained staff, and quite often just about general organization. On the one hand the hotel has everything you would expect of a luxury beach resort hotel, and there is nothing to complain about as such, but for me there was just something slightly missing - it was all TOO standard luxury beach resort, like many others I have stayed in, and no real “wow” factor as such. I suppose it’s difficult to be a “different” beach resort, and perhaps I just stay in too many hotels, but these beach resorts all tend to have the same formula and once one has stayed in a few, they all sort of blend together in your mind – nothing truly memorable ! I had recurring thoughts of Monty Python’s “Package Tour Complaint” skit – go look it up if you aren’t familiar with it ! We would actually like to go back some time and spend a bit longer, as lazing around the pool with a drink was just what we needed at the end of a busy 3 week trip to India and Sri Lanka. In the end though we had a pleasant stay, and no real issues, and I therefore recommend it as a good place to spend a few days and relax !",neutral
"My husband and I, recently spent a week here. We thoroughly enjoyed experiencing the elegant hotel created by Geoffrey Bawa, and harmonious integration of outside/inside spaces with the beach setting. It is a much larger hotel than we anticipated and seemed to cater to package group tours, but given the nature of the hotel layout one could escape the more vibrant activity. The staff are friendly, courteous and quick to respond to specific requests. The breakfast buffet, provided a vast array of choice and was well presented. The fine dining restaurant was a pleasure, with delicious combinations and well executed dishes. The chef was particularly attentive and welcoming ensuring he engaged with all patrons at some point during the evening that only added positively to the overall dining experience. The two swimming pools are fabulous, great temperature, clean and provide a choice of setting. I personally loved watching the local wild life (birds, squirrels & lizards) co- existing amongst the sun lounges. We understand that the local community need to make a living and that the tourists can be a great source of income , but perhaps a sunset beach market could be collaboratively set up between locals and the hotel to minimise the continual daily spruiking alongside the pool area and beach interface. I had one treatment at the spa, and the massage itself was excellent. My recomendations, are that the Spa pricing on the menu be updated to reflect the actual charge in rupees ( which is high by international standards), and that consideration be given to enhancing the approach to the spa centre and spa reception area. Do be aware that unlike some other hotels we stayed at in, Sri Lanka (Cinnamon Red, Colombo and Maheweli Reach, Kandy), a 10 % surcharge and government taxes are added to all prices, which comparably, resulted in rather inflated prices. We also recommend catching the local buses to experience other cities such as Galle or Bentota. These were clean, uncrowded and gave a high vantage point to enjoy the scenery. Also exceptionally priced. Overall we had a great experience and recommend this hotel.",positive
"Well, if you like a large noisy hotel with shabby rooms and indifferent food, then this is the place for you. On the plus side the beach is pristine, and the inexperienced staff try their best. BUT it is a very large hotel which opens its doors to day trippers at the weekend, so the pool is full of screaming children. In the morning you cannot sit by the main pool because of the noise from speakers accompanying aerobics - ugh. The rooms are decorated in the bare plaster look which does not stand up to wear and tear. The food is average if you like buffets at specific times. A la carte is mainly burger and chips with variations. The prices for food are higher than the Hilton in Colombo, and what really annoyed me the most was that the hotel write up proports to show this as a 5* establishment, with prices to match when in fact I have stayed in many rest houses with better facilities.",neutral
"We travelled as a family and stayed in a deluxe suite, so had plenty of room. The furnishings in the room were a little dated, and the hotel as a whole could do with a revamp. There is a new luxury 5 star hotel being built next door, and I wondered whether the Heritance is gradually sliding to the rung below international luxury hotel, so as not to have direct competition. The food and service here were definitely substandard in comparison to the other hotels on our trip (Ulagalla, Anantaya and Jetwing Lighthouse and Yala), and our son ended up with food poisoning on our last evening, nearly delaying our return home. It was hard to get a table in the restaurant, and once seated it was hard to get the staff's attention for any drinks. The hotel was not very responsive to requests (we had problems with ants in the room, a lamp not working and a couple of other things) but the boy looking after our room was very attentive. Having said that, the hotel was very helpful about allowing us to use another room on the day of departure so that we could continue to use the facilities. I think there was a laundry issue: each time we asked for pool towels we were told there weren't any, but they did eventually materialise from a tumble dryer. Service at the pool bar was extremely erratic and inconsistent - we usually had to walk up to the bar to get attention. The stretch of beach by the hotel was lovely, and the currents not as strong as in some places, but still a risk for swimming. There was often entertainment on the beach, but two days after fireworks, the debris was still littering the beach. You have a great stretch of sand, don't ruin it! All in all, the hotel gives the impression of a gradual decline, which is a shame. Our room (at the very end of a corridor) was very quiet, but our friends stayed in a suite nearer to the main part of the hotel (329, I think) where you could hear all the entertainment all evening.",negative
"We stayed here for 21 nights for our 30th wedding anniversary and stayed bed and breakfast. The staff in this hotel are excellent, from the waiting staff in the restaurants to the pool staff. They could not do enough for you. Our rooms was lovely with a really large balcony, the air conditioning instead of a unit which in many hotels are above the bed are placed behind panels and thankfully not over the bed, shower was fantastic. We had a tour of the kitchens and on talking to the staff discovered that we could ask for anything not included on the menus in Mustard and the a la carte restaurant. The menus were quite small and we wondered how we would manage for 21 nights but the food on the menus were good, especially the curries and the prawns, on request we were able to order some traditional Sri Lankan food. The chef came out and spoke to us and was pleased that we had taken our time to research the Sri Lankan food and asked for it to be cooked. We took a 4 day tour up to Dambulla, Kandy etc and it was very good indeed (organised through our tour company Mercury Direct). We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel. Its location on the beach is excellent but it would have been nice to have been able to have had a sun lounger and umbrella on the beach but we were put off by the hawkers who won't leave you alone so you can't have a quiet walk to the sea or on the beach without being followed - it is the only thing that I would comment negatively on - luckily the grounds are pleasant to sit in, sun loungers plentiful and the wildlife totally fascinating.",positive
"The hotel is very beautiful and has 2 pools, and spa facilities. One of the pools had a live entertainer playing some sort of traditional flute. The location of the hotel is convenient as it's directly next to the beach. We tried the massage and the spa facility, and it was very good, although a bit expensive when compared to other 5 star hotels in Sri Lanka. The rooms were tidy and well equipped. The bathroom is a bit small, but up to the standards. As with previous Heritance hotel we visited, the bottles of shampoo and shower gel need to be reviewed from an ergonomic point of view. They are difficult to pour from, either you pour too little or too much. On the down sides, the check-in process took around 30 to 40 minutes. Not sure why. The buffet was a disappointment. After all the great things we encountered in this hotel, we were looking forward to an amazing gastronomic experience. However the buffet was poor in terms of both variety and quality. We happened to be at the hotel on a full moon (Buddha Day), which is a holiday in Sri Lanka. Maybe that was the reason for the bad quality of the buffet, due to lack of staff? I'm not really sure. In general it was a pleasant experience and would recommend staying at the hotel.",neutral
Very nice environment!! Nice and clean ! Food is pretty awesome would recommend this place to anyone specially to families . It's in front of the beach too nice sandy clean beach must go if you're going to lanka !!! Thanks for the awesome service guys !,positive

This was one of my greatest ever place I stayed in my visit to Sri Lanka. Mainly I have to say this place feels like your home to relax. Beautiful views with sea breeze made me to feel not to leave this place forever and as well this was sharpened more and more by the friendly helpful staff who works in the hotel. Special thanks goes to all staff. Something I shouldn't forget to mention is about the excellent food served by the hotel gives more pride towards the reputation. For that many thanks for the excellent work done by the hotel chefs. so all and all amazing lovable place with awesome food among friendly staff made my visit perfect and meaningful.,positive
We stayed at hotel in couple of days and I highly recommend this place based on the excellent service we got. The food was delicious ..... The service is superb and the staff is really friendly. Waiting for my holidays to stay again,positive
"The big plus of this hotel is its location. Its right on the beach, and a beautiful one at that. Also its swimming pools are really nice and big. We visited the place in December 14 - with our three little children. For travelers with family the one big downside is, that the hotel doesn't offer any rooms with inter-connecting doors. So unless and until you have a suite (not sure if they have any) you might end up with two rooms that are not connected, which is a serious problem if you travel with young children. With one or two children you will be all right since that would probably allow you to all stay in one room. As long us our children are young we would not go back to this hotel. The other downside was the breakfast. The breakfast room/area is very noisy at times its quite difficult to talk to each other due to the noise. If the weather is good, try to get a table outside. I would recommend this place to couples for then to families.",positive
Very good beach resort with 2 big pools. The rooms do not directly open up to the beach though. Few ground floor rooms open to pool others just have a patio to the garden. The upper floors have a good ocean view from the balcony. The suites are really nice. Fantastic food with a wide selection at the buffets. The dinner on the beach is a nice touch. Great for honeymooners as well as families.,positive
"We have just arrived home from the New Years Eve vacation in Sri Lanka. We stat in Heritance for 8 nights with all inclusive. I will start this review by saing that the hotel is not a 5 star rating by any standards I would rate the hotel rather as 4 star. The meals were very good with great diversity and the local beverages were more than satisfactory. At the time of our visit, the chef was chinese national and the variety and taste of the food (sri lankan, chinese and international) was significant. Tip for all inclusive: Ask for fresh pinapple juice and if you look for lemonade ask for lime or lemon juice and add soda and sugar of your choice. DO NOT ASK FOR LEMONADE BECAUSE THIS IS A BOTTLED JUICE not a fresh juice. Ask for local whiskey and local Lion cold beer that are of a good quality. We had two deluxe rooms on the first floor and there were no issues with noice as we read on several reviews. We had experimented the hotel massage and we discovered that it was a ballinese massage not a traditional ayurvedic massage. The hotel massage was good but I will rather try an Sri Lankan traditional massage in Sri Lanka. The hotel massage for two was 190 USD and this was over-priced. We had also try the ayurvedic massage near the hotel in a local facility and this cost us 40 USD for two persons and it was realy great. For a local ayurvedic massage go on the beach and turn right, go towards the Sunshine restaurant and just before the restaurant turn right on a small street and you will find the massage center on your right hand side after a 100 meters walk. When you walk on the beach you will be approched by local ""guides"" that will try to sell trips or goods and you can avoid them with a smile and simple NO THANK YOU. If you walk out on the main street there is a different story and the ""guides"" are more aggresive and we discover that it was difficult to get read of them. We had some bad experience with the street guides and I will strongly suggest to plan a trip within the hotel premises an leave the hotel with a guide on a tuck tuck or taxi. After the unpleasant experience from the street we used the service of a local propper guide, Mr. Channa mobile number +947726300008 (check also on www.channatoursbentota.com) and the trips were of a good quality and VERY reasonable price. Concerning the hotel location you will discover that is located within a village with no option for entartainment in the hotel vicinity. The nearby excursion were Maduganga river safary that was on a 5 minutes tuck tuck drive and Galle trip that was 1 hour by taxi. Unfortunately the rest of the trips were involving a full day travel due to the poor local infrastructure. If you wish to feel the Indian Ocean take care with the underwater courent that is very strong. If you wish to visit more of the country you should consider if you stay in a single hotel and travel every day for an entire day or you travel from one hotel to an other for an adequate visit. As a conclusion, from my point of view, the travellers that are looking for relaxing time on a beach with great food, good local drinks and just a couple of trips this hotel is adequate. If you wish to see more of the island beauty and explore Sri Lanka you should consider traveling from one location to an other and go also to Heritance Ahungala for a relaxing day on the beach (swimming pool) with good food and drinks. The wifi was available but very poor as speed and signal.",positive
Nice atmosphere. Good place to relax your mind and soul. Nice sea view. Average service. Quality of food is not upto the star class hotel standards. Poor spread of food. Staff needs to be trained further.,neutral
"We had bee here in 2002 and 2004 upon arrival having booked a suite it was full of Mosquitos we booked A I went for dinner inedible the wine was just terrible! We went to remember the 10 anniversary of the Tusnami , when we were there. It was a huge dissapointment! It was with regret we had to complain. After a meeting with the general manager every thing changed, we renegotiated the AI do not do it! We re started on B&B it all changed. It is NOT the standard hotel it was, it is with regret I have to say this, the horribly black dinning room! On we go the sun beds are so unbelievably bad they aren't describable , when you see the staff wheeling one wheel with the other on the top ready to stick it back on, residents having to use just the pads on the floor as they don't have enough beds and lying on the grass infested with ants. There are so few umbrellas when yo leave your bed they have to move them for other residents , this is a 2 star or less and I really hate to gave to give this review , but I as an experienced well travelled Sri Lankan tourist I'm so sorry to say I will not be returning. Also to add the beach sellers who I had known since 2002 and have supported. Even to getting a sewing machine funded are the most intense in all our travels they drove us to distraction ! No we won't ever go back and this leaves me with a sad heart on my live of my beloved island",negative
"What a great property. Besides the facilities is a sea facing pool and other regular things for residents, the smile on the faces of each and every staff made the stay wonderful . Spent 3 nites with family and enjoyed every bit of it . The food was well structured and appealing to the palate of large groups of multinational people . That says quite a bit that the hotel is used to managing this kind of crowd. Overall a great property/ great facilities/ great food (especially if you are a seafood lover ) and wonderful service and hospitality . Kudos to Heritance Ahungalla !",positive
"I chose this hotel because it was designed by Geoffery Bawa. The rooms and resort are lovely, but definitely in need of upgradation in many areas. The upper floors look like they've been refurbished, but the lower floors have not. Upon check in, we realised the air conditioning in our room wasn't working, we got twin beds, when we had requested a king size bed and the wi-fi was intermittent. Given the quality and state of the rooms, i was not happy to pay 280USD a night.",neutral
What a lovely hotel this is and the staff are a real pleasure nothing is too much trouble. We asked for a quiet room and were give same in on the 1st floor away from the noise. The pools are a delight both clean and uncrowded and the food is of excellent quality with plenty of choice at all meals. If there is anything here that could be improved I would say that the man bar area just off reception is probably a little small when the hotel is full and the seating here is quite uncomfortable although aesthetically pleasing; perhaps more seating could be provided in the actual reception area at this time. All in all we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and would return with no hesitation,positive
Hotel is excellent. Rooms are great and spacious. Excellent bed and got a very nice balcony. Food is excellent with a very wide spread. Got a wonderful beach and a very. Ice pool. We had a wonderful time.,positive
"We know the hotel as we used to stay there several years in a row some years ago. The architecture is stunning, but some improvements on the rooms are needed to bring it back to 5 star standards. Upon check-in we were early and were told that normal check-in time is 2 pm. We waited for 2 1/2 hours til 2 pm and several inquiries, there we were told, that they are checking. At 2 pm it seems everybody arriving after us was checked-in and we still did not get any information. I went to the reception to complain, but they were busy to set up other guests internet on the phone than to attend to guests who were waiting for 2 1/2 hours. After asking for the manager it suddenly worked and we got a room and apology. Although we asked for the new wing, we were offered a room in the old wing. Despite of kitchen odor this room was definitely the better choice for us as on the other side a 2 day party was going on with lots of noise. Room was ok and had a nice sea view. Cleanliness of the room could have been better. Especially in the shower there were signs of mould and shower door was completely covered with limescale. Service especially upon check-in was definitely not 5 star standard. Also for breakfast it was announced to start at 7 am, but when we came down ones at 7.10 am, nothing was ready, noone was taking note in order to serve coffee or tea. The egg corner was not occupied to order eggs, etc. If 7 am is published for breakfast, it should be ready for service. Food was very good though. Another point to reconsider might be the christmas decoration which did not fit the hotel at all. All in all we had a nice stay in the end. If we would come back, we are not sure as we know better from this hotel from previous stays and it is quite pricy for the service offered.",neutral

"Great place to stay for a much needed vacation. The property is huge with a long stretch of private beach, quite apt for pleasant morning and evening walks. Found the breakfast buffet quite good with many Indian breakfast choices. The food quality was also up to the mark and satisfied people with different palate. Rooms are beautiful with a nice balcony (view of the beach and waves) and the decor gives the feel of a nice cottage. Room service is good and given the expanse of the property, it is quick too! It can get a little noisy in the night by the beach, if the hotel is having full occupancy. Else the stay will be peaceful and quiet.",positive
"After leaving the rain and cold behind in the uk we got off to a great start of a two weeks break starting here and then to be followed by a week in the Maldives,no big delay with SRI airways which was fantastic,food provided was really good as was the service ( who were spotless in uniform and appearance unlike BA who we traveled later to Maldives who's uniform looked liked it had purchased from a second hand shop!!!!)We arrived and picked up by our lovely driver who told us the journey to the hotel would take 3 Hours ( not for the faint hearted ) so you have been warned .When we arrived at the hotel the staff couldn't do enough for bringing cool drinks/towels after our long journey. The hotel was lovely has you travel through it the style is very unusual as in some parts it's open to sky with trees where if your lucky you catch the monkeys jumping from one to another there was also a crashed plane ( not a real one ) full scale that lights up at night . We really loved it But if I'm going to be a bit picky ,we did full board if I'm honest it was very little choice I got bored after day two And here comes the big negative was The Beggars on the beach as soon as you stepped out of your pool area they wouldn't leave you alone ( whatever you do don't befriend them it took 45 mins to get rid of one guy) I only went in the sea once In the whole seven days we stayed , such a shame as it was beautiful,but overall lovely hotel and staff.One tip if traveling from here to Maldives do not purchase any at duty free alcohol at the airport as it will be confiscated at male airport ( but will return it to you on your return trip ) .",positive
"Heritance Ahungalla is truly the best customer service oriented hotel in Ahungalla. We stayed at Heritance from December 18th - December 22nd and we did not receive any of the negative services mentioned by other reviewers. GM Rifhan and F&B Director Gamini and Kumara went out of their way to service out every request. Indika, Shehan and Nadesh did a wonderful job taking care of our reservations. The team at Ahungalla not only went out of there way to provide us great service but they went beyond their job description to service us. My wife and I were responsible for the beautiful Marquee that was put up. We had planned the wedding for over a year and the team at Heritance went out of there way to help us through it. Chef Dimuthu and his team created a wonderful menu and all the guests raved about the food and the desserts. I apologize for any guests that had their view obstructed but it was only up for 2 days and the team at Heritance made sure all the other guests who were there were taken care of. The Heritance team from the management to the wait staff provided ALL 62 of our guests PERFECT service. All except 1 but we can ensure that if needed we will get all 61 to review heritance and all 61 would be happy to review this hotel positively. This hotel has magnificent views as well and if your planning to stay here, I would fully say that the pool and sea view on the hotel is by far the best in the area. My wife and I cannot thank Heritance enough and we want to ensure their staff that their hard work is not going unnoticed and that everyone at the wedding truly enjoyed themselves. Thank you for giving us our dream wedding.",positive
"We stayed in the luxury suite which was spacious. The service from the staff was excellent and very obliging. A few issues which need to be resolved - 1) the facts in the information section in each of the rooms indicating that Tamils mostly arrived in the 19th century is fraudulent, 2) internet access needs to be improved such that someone doesn't need to re-register every time they leave the room or the hotel and return, 3) showers sometimes seem to not drain properly leading to flooding.",positive
"Heritance Ahungalle Hotel is a great retreat in Sri Lanka, but you must adjust your expectations before moving in. We had booked a de-lux room with balcony overlooking the beach and ocean - romantic, eh?Unfortunately, the hotel and consequently the room was very 'tired' and had seen better days. The hotel even suffered poorly maintained sidewalks, tennis courts, beach loungers, etc. Most was simply under maintained. Our balcony was adjacent to the rooms on either side, separated only by planters, and the view of beach and ocean obscured by a large (but beautiful) tree. It may not have been a problem anyway, as on the second day of our stay, the hotel maintenance people set up a huge beach-obscuring marquee (JAG_68056) for another wedding. They have about 20 weddings per year, so we learned. Perhaps that wasn't so bad either, but the band wars (wedding band, bar music, and local flute player) that ensued developed an impossible cacophony of loud music which made it impossible to sleep. Our 'package' was directly booked through Heritance's agent: bed and breakfast. We soon discovered there were many alternate 'packages' which ranged from full board to 'good deals' offering better accommodation for less than we paid. Check it out before 'checking in'. The food was good, especially the buffet (good value and variety) ... but the beach-hawkers were definitely a deterrent from enjoying the beach. The hotel should definitely do something about them! They were ever-present from sun up to sun down. The redeeming feature of the hotel was the always friendly and hospitable staff ... always willing to serve and support. The Guest Relations team did their very best. One last word of advice would be to insist that any Ahungalla-related transportation from Colombo Airport to the hotel take the new highway ... it seems that the drivers attempt to circumvent the highway-toll gates by taking secondary roads which are long, uncomfortable, dangerous, and nauseating. Happy travels!",negative
"I would personally like to thank the ahungalla heritance team for making my special day memorable as the whole hotel staff came together to make this event the best wedding!! And for making so many adjustments just to make us happy. The buffet was so good that my friend from Brazil wanted to marry the buffet!! Also the beautiful cake which is unbelievably tasty and looks so beautiful!! The wedding is the most important day of any girls life and Heritance Ahungalla made it happen!! Also would say the Care they took of all our families who stayed there which was about 60+ rooms was great too. Once again highly recommend the hotel and specially Refan, Gamini, kumara, Indika, Nadesh chef Dimuthu and his team and the team who made the best buffet too! Thank you from the bottom of my heart! Hope to celebrate our anniversary every year at Heritance Ahungalla 😘",positive
"Heeitance Ahungalle in ahungalle town, which is barely 20 mins drive from bentota. Though you are away from bentota you don't feel the distance much. The reception has a good view of the pool which overlooks the beach. The beach is clean and inviting. Nice place for a quick retreat. The spread of food is reasonably good. Jeffrey, the architect has given a local and rustic touch to the deco of the rooms. One can consider staying on the 3rd floor (rooms 325-330) which had a good view of the ocean. Few negatives. The property has only one lift, which caters to all the rooms and one needs to walk alot if the rooms are allotted on the other side of the lift, which may get annoying especially with elders. Secondly the food may be an issue if you are a vegan unless you are not very keen with the spread. overall a good choice.

"This is a nice hotel. We generally enjoyed our stay, but qualified by the comment below. Special commendation for the hotel's service staff who were very helpful and pleasant. The qualification: The hotel website features photos of lovely views of the ocean from the hotel's main dining areas and pool. Moreover, we booked a ""premium"" room to enjoy the view of the beach and the ocean that comes with these rooms. A guest of the hotel should have a reasonable expectation that was is displayed on the website regarding visual amenity is what they will get if they book. However, for much of our stay, the hotel's beach-side amenity was marred by the construction and deconstruction (over four days) of a large marquee running the entire length of the hotel's main access way to the beach. This marquee does not appear in any photo on the hotel's website. Its presence, in my view, thus represents a breach, however minor, of the contract between hotel and guest. Because full-fee-paying hotel guests were not put first in this regard, it is unlikely that we will return to this hotel.",neutral
"Really pleasant staff .Staying here over Christmas.Long distance from anything. Best part was a beach resturant Sunshine . Poor tennis court surface Buffet meal tasteless ,no outside area to eat. Coffee bar area slightly better to eat in. Hawkers on the beach a nuisance.",neutral
"I was attending a wedding held on 20th December 2014 and a friend of mine and I had decided to stay at Heritance. Coming from the UK I was keen to stay close to the wedding venue and enjoy the supposed five star luxury that this hotel boasted to offer. My friend a resident of Sri Lanka arranged the accommodation some five months in advance for us to stay from 19 Dec till 21 Dec, using Booking.com. However upon arrival, they didn't have our booking for 19 only 20. Some 45 minutes, emails and phone calls later I was given a room based on half board. The room itself was large and nice. A bit dark in decor but view of sea front was nice. The hotel is large however there is no clear indication of how the rooms are numbered on each floor. There is according to the member of staff showing me to my room a north and South wing again this is not indicated visibly so it's easy to get lost. The entrance of the hotel is stunning however the rest of the hotels falls in comparison. For four hours I was without WIFI, a number of phone calls later a staff member turns up and fiddles with my phone including switching my phone off airplane mode connecting me to my UK service provider and leaving me with a £40.00 data roaming fee whilst still not realising that the Wifi was an issue with the hotel and not my phone. After trying to relocate me to a new room much smaller with a terrible view I eventually head in hands and eyes filled with tears of frustration and tiredness, was placed in a more pleasant room with a bigger balcony that over looked the sea and the wedding venue. The sliding door which acts as a blackout was unable to fully close because the side table was too big. I had to move this in order for the blackout to fully close. The air conditioner controls were broken in all three rooms so I had to use my nails to switch off the air conditioner. The shower cubicle was placed in such a away that you had to get in close the door before turning shower on. The hotel toiletries were poor - the shower gel and shampoo were all placed in bottles that were not sealed and the soap was well rather useless. There were also no small hand towels or towels big enough to dry hair with. All in all two large bath towels and two hand towels. No bath robes either to sit and relax in. A basic I feel for a hotel claiming to be five star. The mini bar of the last room was broken and had never been checked so we found the drinks warm mouldy and in drinkable. The cost of a glass of wine in comparison to the bottle found in the mini bar also made no sense. It was cheaper in the mini bar. The dining room (only one restaurant in this hotel) was dark and dismal. The hot food area was hard to find until further inspection. The food was ok. A very basic selection. Nothing fancy or elaborate. The bar area outside by entrance was far more prettier yet the service was poor. Morning breakfast in the same dining room was a very dark and gloomy affair. The decor and seating was so basic and dark that you just didn't want to eat in there. The only blessing was the guest relations officer Shanika who was so lovely and ever so eager to ensure we were happy that she went out of her way to do everything to make us feel at ease. We were on exit served with a $200.00 a night bill which I had to question over and over again. I am really sad to say that it was really shocked and disappointed by everything I had witnessed at this ""luxury"" hotel and having had a thorough read of what is expected to meet the international standards of a five star hotel - this to me is just a glorified bed and breakfast. Having experienced five star luxury and also other ratings of hotels I think I have had better staying in a cheap bed and breakfast in Brighton for far less the price tag. I can't say I would recommend this hotel to anyone and would recommend those that work hard for their money go look elsewhere.",negative
"We returned here this December (for the 10th time!) for a relaxing 10-day beach holiday in lovely surroundings. We love this place because of the feeling of spaciousness which the hotel's design engenders - and because each and every staff member seems genuinely interested in doing all they can to ensure that you have an enjoyable stay. Our room was fabulous, with views right across the gardens and the beach. Breakfasts are impressive affairs, and particularly enjoyable if you manage to get a table in the garden. The main restaurant usually provides good buffet style meals. However, we prefer to sit outside and the cafe serves excellent 'rice and curries' dinners (as well as a number of European dishes). Unfortunately, the a-la-carte restaurant was closed for refurbishments during most of our stay. Work on a new hotel adjacent to the Heritance has started, but there is no noticeable disturbance from this. There is free wi-fi throughout the premises and, apart from some difficulties with access codes expiring for no apparent reason, it worked quite well. We thoroughly enjoyed our time at the Heritance and would recommend it to anyone looking for a peaceful hotel on a fantastic beach. The location is great for excursions to places like Hikkaduwa, Galle and Bentota. It literally takes only a few minutes by tuk-tuk to get to the Madu river, where you can rent a boat for a river safari. Michael on the beach arranged some nice trips for us this year (and in the past) and we would also recommend Eranda, one of the tuk-tuk drivers usually waiting by the front gate.",positive
"Great location, great food, quite beach, good rooms. Definitely place to visit again. I was there with my family and everyone enjoyed. Good service. Huge property and had 2 swimming pools, nice and clean. Nearby there is turtle hatchery and river safari, must do. Don't waste time visiting moonstone mines. Whale watching missed since We didn't book in advance.",positive
"I was a part of a team coordinating a wedding to be held at Heritance Ahungalle on Saturday 20th Dec. All plans were in place and all of us in the coordinating team were moving ahead with the game plan when we got to know that the furniture supplier had messed up the order. Needless to say that all hell broke loose while we tried to work out an alternate solution, it was a mere 3 hours before the wedding ceremony. A lot of stress, tension and heart stopping moments later the furniture arrived at 3.00 pm, we had to set up and decorate 30 tables in 1 1/2 hours - guest were due to arrive at 4.30 pm. The team at Heritance Ahungalle, stepped up to the occasion, they deployed additional crew to unload and set up furniture and get it all going to ensure that the wedding set up was ready on time. Their attitude was fantastic - it was a case of everyone working together to give the couple a wedding to remember. The result was fantastic, everything was set up and ready for the wedding with mere moments to spare and it all looked brilliant. It was a result of brilliant cooperation, understanding and adrenaline. No one entering that marquee would have realised the tension we all had to work through - the set up looked stunning and the couple said that it was more than what they expected. What's important is that it was not the responsibility of the hotel to do all this and we in the coordinating crew know that if not for the team at Heritance Ahungalle lead by their F&B Manager Gamini we would not have been to get it all together on time for our clients and give them the wedding of their life. Thank you so much! I have no hesitation in recommending the hotel to anyone.",positive
We would like to extend our sincere thanks to SHEHAN (not sure if its the correct spelling) for being so kind and helpful to us throughout our one night stay on 18th DEC. We were late for check-out (because we were caught up in unexpected circumstances during our whale watching that morning) and he was so helpful to extend our check-out by a few hours. We were greatly touched by his service and really appreciate his effort in making our stay a pleasant one. We stayed in Kandalama hotel before this which is also managed by the Heritance Group and both hotels didn't disappoint us at all. Their customer service is outstanding and always full of smiles. Thank you Heritance Ahungalla for making our stay an awesome one.,positive
Had 3 nights while travelling around Sri Lanka Beach stunning Pools very nice and needed as very hot Food good and very happy staff Enjoyable stay in a nice spot Perfect to stop if looking to visit South of Sri Lanka Beach sellers abit of a pain but did leave you alone if you asked All in all good hotel in great location which has decent food and is very clean. Beach is very nice and staff are very helpful and happy. Rooms and big and clean and very nice. Perfect winter holiday,positive
"We went there for our honeymoon for two weeks.must say each penny was worth spending.the rooms were clean,the staff is so friendly and above all a great relaxing beach.had a great time,enjoyed every meal there.would recommend.",positive
"Stayed here on the first leg of our Sri Lanka holiday, it has a great beachfront location which is a little undermined by the hawkers. To be fair a guard patrolled the 'dividing line' but as soon as you step over that line they have a habit of following you which is not particularly threatening but somewhat annoying. The staff were always really nice and courteous, we opted for bed and breakfast and used the services of a driver (through Aitken Spence) which was a must in my view, who guided us to local sites and restaurants. Rooms are okay if a little underwhelming but nice public areas, and breakfast was nice. If you visit this hotel be sure to take a walk along the beach to Silva's Sunshine Restaurant, simple, fresh and friendy and great value.",positive
"Really good place to stay. 2 excellent pools and on the beach. Very good in almost all respects.Only negatives were the pestering beach hawkers and the buffet which had more quantity rather than quality. Very good a la carte restaurant. Rooms a roomy, clean and well appointed. The hotel was spotless too.",positive
"Visited the hotel for 4 nights. I had booked 7 rooms for friends and family. Great food and very courteous staff. I had booked a suite but the quality of the room was poor, when I discuss this with the front office he promptly moved us to another suite.",negative
"Claims to be a five star resort. It's not. Five star resorts, in fact any decent hotel should care about their guests. They do not have a bloke with the loudest industrial strimmer working right outside a guest's bedroom ceaselessly from 5.30 am. Oh and the wifi is crap.",negative
"Another warm welcome to this hotel - the last stop of our brief visit to the wonderful island of Sri Lanka. After a welcome drink, we were shown to our Deluxe Room. It was small, dark and dingy! Not what we had been used to. We were shown another room - but these rooms were still small but had a sea view but alas the bathroom lacked a bath. We needed a bath to ease away our aches and pains after an amazing tour of this amazing island. I ended up speaking with the Duty Manager, a lovely young gentleman, named Praveen and he graciously upgraded us to a Luxury room each at no extra charge. The rooms had sea views, tea/coffe making facilities, mini-bar, tv and the bathroom contained the most important thing - a bath. I was in the older wing of this huge hotel and had a few problems with electrical problems, which were soon sorted out. I noticed that a lot of maintenance was being done in this wing - which was a good thing as this was low season and maintenance needed doing to bring this wing up to its star rating! The pools were amazing. This hotel had a gymn, tennis courts, billiard room, spa - in fact everything that one needed was here. In the gardens, I saw iguanas, cheeky little squirrels and a lot of birds, It was a little peace of paradise. My description of this hotel read "" a beach hotel, where style and substance mix like a classic cocktail. Just as the turquoise infinity pool seems to blend into the ultramarine Indian Ocean, award-winning cuisine fuses the best of east and west. Heritance Ahungalla, where a little magic is woven into your holiday memories, while promising you the finest hospitality and best luxury services among Sri Lankan beach hotels. This description summarizes my experience of this hotel perfectly! I quickly got to know the staff and found them extremely friendly and helpful, The wait staff in the restaurant and bars were a fantastic bunch! Thank you one and all for such a memorable stay!! A very special thank you to the wonderful Chefs who treat us like Queens and honoured us with a tour of their kitchen. Nothing was too much trouble for them. Thank you all xx I was lucky enough to see two bridal parties, which took my breath away. Another day, a couple had hired an elephant for a private photo shoot - but we all got in on the action! Would I visit this hotel again - YES PLEASE!",positive
"This is a great hotel to stay, I had the most amazing time and the food is wonderful. The rooms are clean and big with sea view balcony. You get woken up with a lovely suttle music which is played with a flute by a local gent seated on a boat next to the pool. The pool is a serenity pool wich is huge and it is next to the beach. The hotel is suited for couples and family and it's very safe. Only 10 to 15 min to Hikkaduwa.",positive
We have visited Sri Lanka 9 times and have to say this was the best hotel the staff are a real credit to the hotel they couldn't do enough for us A very relaxed atmosphere first class service in every respect from gardeners to chefs Special thanks to K K and Pasindu and all your first class chefs had a wonderful stay would recommend it to everyone ( happy days ),positive
"Just as I remembered it. The superb food, the charming staff and off course the flautist. It couldn't have been a better place to stay. Great facilitates such as the Tennis Court, Table Tennis, Badminton and the gym. Even when we left they gave us one more gift of a little 'leaving' bag with a bottle of water. Will definitly stay at this hotel again, bit sad as it is quite far from the Capital but otherwise all round great!",positive
"This was the much anticipated final stop on our recent Sri Lanka tour. The welcome, the hotel and the room was wonderful. We were upgraded to a beach view which was fantastic and our housekeeper chap made a point of saying hello and checking we were happy. Problems with our safe were quickly and efficiently fixed and copious apologies all round! The bar and the pool was superbly kept and very quiet during the day, adding to the peace and calm. In terms of food, breakfast was excellent and the lunch bar options were varied and tasty and real value for money. Dinner wad also good, in fact, the head chef gave my husband a back room tour, including their amazing award winning chocolate creations. The only slight, slight, point I might make is options were slightly more limited in terms of variety towards the end of our stay, similar curry options, a couple of uninspiring choices, but the quality did not fail and there were fewer guests, but an amazing pudding selection, according to my sweet toothed husband and for me, the best hoppers of the tour. We found the beach sellers to be friendly, they left you alone when you asked and were nowhere near as annoying as other parts of the World....and Crikey, they are trying to earn a living! Overall, a lovely end to our holiday!",positive
My 3rd visit to this hotel. I have always been very happy. Staff is especially nice to children. Guy called Chathuranga was especially helpful and nice from the booking process and through out the stay too. Only complaint are a stair case that is unprotected (risky for children) and the bacon in the breakfast that was not cooked enough.,positive
"Re-visiting after many years, Heritance Ahungalla(formerly Triton) more than lived up to our expectations. Superb food, the staff could not have been more helpful and charming. We will certainly be returning the next time we are in Sri Lanka.",positive
"A well established hotel, providing good service and excellent food. A lovely well serviced room with a balcony and sea view, with constant sound of the sea. Easy access from Colombo. We have enjoyed several visits here and have never been disappointed. The breakfast is especially wonderful with a quality selection of sri Lanka specialities as well as a good choice of other foods.",positive
"I've had the privilege of visiting the Heritance Ahungalla Hotel quite frequently over the years and admittedly their warmly welcoming traits in the spirit of culture and tradition reminds me of the saying that you never get a 2nd chance to make the 1st impression! Its not just the arrival to tease but the way in which they attend to the guest from the beginning to the end is a very enriching experience for me consistently over a period of time and in that context, I salute the much valued top to bottom driven service oriented style of approach which extends a special feeling of being cared for right through the stay. As per my experience, they truly live up to a 5 star beach resort including impressive food, tastefully done rooms, good leisure activities and special areas of relaxation with refreshing water as the focus not forgetting the attractive design uniquely created. When one has to pay a price in accordance with its status, obviously any guest would want to be assured of the highest standards in every aspect to feel that the value for money element is most worthwhile. As for me personally, everything revolves around excellent service oriented skills which enhances the level of confidence that one's requests are being addressed efficiently just the same way how effective communication can build trust followed up with expected delivery. The beauty of a hotel is truly enhanced by the character of its human resources and also the attention to detail attitude which I have experienced first hand and hopefully this trademark that Heritance Ahungalla has inherited will be sustained to benefit the many guests who are looking for a holiday that embraces the rich cultural values of Sri Lanka with warmth and an enchanting smile unique to our nation.",positive
"After coming from Heritance Kandalama we expected the same. This is not the case. I did not want to jump on here and be outright negative, but there is good and bad here. Our room has a broken aircon, bathroom exhaust fan, telephone and main door lock, with no safe. Pretty alarming. Our guy that cleans the room is wonderful and has tried his best to get everything fixed up. So far the kettle has been replaced. They have tried to fix the phone several times with no luck. Reception rings you constantly but you can not talk to them, very annoying. Outside the gates are pushy tuk tuk drivers in a dirty street. Surprising since Sri Lanka is a very clean country with mostly beautiful helpful people. Not here though. We were really looking forward to a few days in the pool looking at the ocean after a pretty hectic schedule. As soon as you get to the pool the yelling people on the beach trying to sell dodgy wares ruins it straight away. Even security and staff were called several times to try and help ripped off tourists. But security does nothing. It is like they work with them. After all the places we have stayed in Sri Lanka this is the worst. We would not come back here again.",negative
"We stayed in this hotel on our first visit to Sri Lanka and fell in love with personnel and Sri Lanka. The beach was clean and specially made swimming possible even when ocean was wavy. Personnel was very attentive, everywhere was very clean, hotel territory and interior was well designed, rooms are large with ocean view. In Heritance Ahungalla we discovered the true heritage of Sri Lankans and really enjoyed our stay. It's worth to mention that the food hotel is serving is authentic, incredibly tasty and diverse.",positive
"Approach to hotel uninviting, but then through the gates a lovely setting and warm welcome, but irritation factor from incessant beach vendors and loud guests and even the street dogs make it into the hotel too because of its open design. Felt sorry for the staff dealing with inconsiderate drunks day and night. The service was hit and miss, food varied and well presented, but not the best I had in Sri Lanka, though signature spiced ice cream was wonderful. Some very nice staff, but suspect some unsavoury ones in league with beach vendors and tuk tuk drivers. Beach immediately in front of hotel fine, but elsewhere litter and no peace if walking cos of beach boys. Found lack of chains and double locks on room doors unnerving. Pillows gave best night's sleep in SL. Spa has a great range of treatments and lovely staff and one of the nicest I have ever been to and worth every penny. Would not choose to return here unfortunately. Prefer Heritance Kandalama.",neutral
"My previous heritance experience at Kandalama and Tea Factory set a high expectation from Ahungalla as well and they did pretty well. In Sri Lanka, this is my favorite hotel chain, because they make you feel awesome from the point you arrive at the hotel to departure. I arrived with a warm welcome from the staff and I was surprised that they were informative enough to guess that I’m the one “who booked 3 rooms online with 3 infants and a toddler”. I received an upgrade for all 3 rooms since the hotel was fully booked and they made every effort to serve us although we had to wait quite a time to receive the 3rd room (due to late check-outs and we arriving sharp on time for check-in). I enjoyed the entire stay with exceptional hospitality. At the restaurant, each and every member of staff greets you. I’m sure the organization takes a lot of effort to keep this attitude across all staff and the unique fact is they treat locals and foreigners with same level of enthusiasm and respect which many local hotels don’t do. To talk about food, it was awesome. I particularly got excited with several dishes, to name a few “diyabath”, egg hoppers with cheese, heritance spicy ice cream, yogurt ice cream (which took me back to school days which resembled the taste of “yogurt ice packets” we used to eat). They had endless variety of food at the buffet from battered prawns to crab, turkey, pork…you name it they have it. I appreciate the fact that it was not only variety but the tantalizing taste…”diyabath” was a winner! The hotel itself was not so exciting in terms of exquisiteness. Still love the view of the pool at the entrance. I would like to draw hotel’s attention to the t-shirts and scarf sellers loafing around trying to sell stuff to hotel guests and people who are not hotel’s guests hanging in the hotel’s beach. All in all hats off to Ahungalla for making our stay feel much at home. Keep going! Thanks Mr. Thushara for that fantastic effort to take a group picture of us including the little ones who didn’t bother to pose ",positive
Best of the best out of 21 hotels I have visited. Really really big rooms with delicious meals excellent service I ever experienced. Definitely once again im gonna visit that place. Really enjoyed everything. thanx Heritance.,positive
"This was the 04th Hotel I selected for my vacations in Sri Lanka in 2014. Although I experienced some unexpected long delays in checking me IN, the rest I experienced removed my anger faster than I wanted to. Room (suite) is very specious and well laid-out. Linen were clean, crispy with nice fragrance. Restaurant is clean, good quality tasty food with plenty to select, but the hall is slightly dark towards the centre. Plenty of space to wonder around, two swimming pools, Nice (but small) gym, tennis and badminton, Snooker, library..all in good shape and order. We were served with evening snacks on all three days, tea, coffee..all good enough to create a wonderful memory. Above all, the dinner arrangement outside on the beachfront to celebrate our wedding anniversary was commendable! Most of the staff were very friendly except for the one at the reception who failed to handle our arrival and delays from the hotel side in most wrongful manner. Another negative was the shower inside the toilet continued to spill water outside of the tub and keeping the toilet dry was a nightmare! Despite above two negatives, In general, it was a very pleasant stay and wanting to go again!",positive
I went to this hotel after 15 years. It was our Annual Company Staff trip. Rooms were ample and well kept. Very comfortable bed and suiting lightings. Food was to be amazed not so good. Everything was lacking something and not the best food ever surprisingly. Service wasn't up to the standard. I had to wait more than ten minutes after requesting cutlery for dinner. And requesting hot water took more than ever. At breakfast I had to eat without a serviette because Steward never showed up. Sometimes I had to yell at them in order to get water. This type of service is never expected from a five star rated hotel. The night club was so much fun. The other terrible fact about the hotel was they switch off the lights in the corridors and we had to assist ourselves with a torch in order to find the room. Some of my friends had mistakenly tapped the wrong room. I mean this is a hotel which operates 24/7 and why do they wanna switch off the lights? Anyway I'm very disappointed with the service and food. I hope this will no longer continue. The best thing was the soothing beach view which was so relaxing. The two pools were breathtaking too.,negative
"We started our honeyroom trip from heritance hotel. It was our first stop and stayed for 2 nights. They were kind enough to upgrade our room once they found out that we were on honeymoon. Additionally, they decorated our room and left us with complimentary fruit platter, cake and some sushi.. It was a really nice gesture from them. Room we stayed on was good and had a great vew of the Indian ocean. Staff was friendly, attentive and always helpful. overall it was a good experience for us.",positive
"See comments below. Rooms - very poor, given cost Food- depends when you eat, the later the worse. Beach location excellent Gardens excellent. Staff good Definitely wouldn't go again or recommend. Yet the outdoor areas were lovely",neutral
"Nice hotel but could be so much nicer with a bit of TLC! Mainly the corridors leading to your room and could be a bit creepy when leaving hotel in early hours, as there are no corridor lights! The infinity pool is lovely as you first walk in! All the staff are lovely and helpful! The drink selection wasn't so great, I couldn't find anything nice to drink (I don't drink lager, which I noticed most people drinking)! The cocktails weren't great but you don't go to Sri Lanka for cocktails! The food was amazing not only in the hotel but everywhere! I did try hard to eat Sri Lankan food all the time but my stomach couldn't take it by the end of the holiday! The restaurant was very atmospheric and the staff very attentive (you hadn't even put your knife and fork down before your plate was whisked away)! As we travelled around the island a lot (staying in different hotels) we only spent two days by the pool! Which was lovely and relaxing with constant food and drink service! The beach was a no go area! The sea was too rough and you were constantly surrounded by the locals selling. Overall, the hotel was a good base for us to travel around this wonderful island! We visited so much in our short space of time there!",positive
"We spent five days in this nice resort.Rooms are spacious and well equipped but need mild renovations.Location is magnificent overlooking the indian ocean, with a beautiful lovely nature all around as well as very relaxing atmosphere.Staff without expetion are so friendly and cute.Food quality and diverisity outstanding.There was more than outdoor swimming pools, a moderate gym and spa all were as expected. Highly recommended for all kinds of trips.",positive
"We selected this hotel for one night on 1st November 2014 on our way back to Colombo. It turned out to be a good choice to enjoy the week end. Hotel has a small car park and if you are not a fan of valet parking, better ask the security of a proper parking place before you take your vehicle out from the reception. We had a warm welcome at the reception and a choice of welcome drinks were offered as well. However we had to wait approximately 35 mins at the lobby until the rooms got prepared. I had booked two standard rooms but the hotel gave me a suite room saying its a last minute promotion. I was bit annoyed by the delay but accepting the suite room made everyone lives pleasant at that moment. Main restaurant is located in the ground floor and they have two swimming pools as well. Food is good, especially the seafood preparation. Pool-side bar is also a nice place to go and have drink. The pool to the north side has a small jacuzzi. Had a great time during the week end but sadly there was no one to say good bye to us when we left the hotel in the evening. Which I think the reception staff should try and improve, because that is also important in this hospitality industry.",positive
"I went there in a group and loved the service. The staff were friendly, the rooms were clean and the location was perfect. I would highly recommend anyone wanting to explore a quiet, beachside hotel which is adequate in luxury, appeal and class. The food however, the buffet could have had more meat options....",positive
"It was a Trip with my office staff (friends) to Heritance. The Place was really unique and they have tried to preserve the environment and the looks of the place. This was evident when we went in a big bus there and the coconut trees were in the middle of the road and we had to navigate the bus to go to the entrance of the hotel complex which was fun. The interior looked nice with white walls in most of the place and it looked nice. The rooms were very clean and they had TV, A Small Kettle with Tea and Coffee Sachets and clean towels. The room had a fairly nice view with half ocean and half the garden which I can't complain about. The Shower presented to be a problem where when I had the evening shower the hot water was working fine but early in the morning the hot water was not there and I had to call-up the housekeeping to turn it on. The shower drain was not draining the water properly and when I finished the shower I was standing in a pool of water in the shower cabin. Also all three Shower Gel, Shampoo and the Body lotion available in the bathroom were of the same fragrant not sure why is that. Other than that the stay was a smooth ride for me. In the night they have arranged a nice place in the beach with lanterns hanging around and nice music playing while we had our drinks and socialized. Then in another part of the hotel they had dinner arranged which was superb with a grill station and DJ music which was fun. The Morning Breakfast and the Lunch was good, they had verity of food and a long line of it as well. We had the chance to feast in all of the variety. The Hotel staff were very friendly and the house keeping was really efficient. I had two instances where in one I wanted an iron delivered to my room it took them only a minute or less to get it to my room and when I asked someone in the ground floor lobby to deliver some fresh towels to my room and when I took the lift and went near the room one of the staff was already there with the towels knocking on my door. In conclusion the stay was really good and they can improve on some of their flaws.",positive
"After visiting the sister hotel in dambulla, I had high expectations for customer service. However I was sadly disappointed apart from a very few members of staff. We arrived after touring Sri Lanka for our honeymoon for a rew days relaxation by the beach.. Dispite the local security we were often harrassed by the local ""beach boys"". A stroll on the beach was anything but relaxing. Although not a private beach the constant calling and shouting at by the locals was very annoying. Even after explaining we were on our honeymoon we were still surrounded by a number of the locals. Obviously this is made worse by the lack of security at the hotel, which allows locals to stroll around even to the resident only pool. After on evening sitting for a pre dinner drink I noticed a number of flis around and which point my husband pointed the food and liquid on the adjacent table. After letting the staff know and expecting a prompt clean up, nothing was done about the mess. In comparison to other hotels within this chain and other hotels we stayed at the hotel was not well maintained. I never saw anyone clean the main lobby and bar areas dispite obvious mess. In fact e only time I say a brush was during a lunchtime of heavy rain to brush the water out and this was only done once. There is a lack of information provided by the hotel. This could easily be rectified by adding a little more information into the room guide. Information about the surrounding area, places to visit and information about food within the restaurant. The hotel food however was of brilliant quality. We enjoyed a meal at the fine dining restaurant and can say this food would not have been out of place at any top london restaurant. The food at the the al a carte restaurant was also of a good standard. The evening buffet was expensive and so we avoided this as we felt it would be poor value and probably poor service what experience we had of breakfast. Now breakfast was a terrible fair, although a wide selection of food not enough waiters or chefs. We came down for breakfast at various times, but noticed if we came after 9.30 no one was around to provide tea or coffee or chefs to cook the food. If we came earlier it was so busy we had to queue for the dishes and the cold foods we're not refilled often enough. Rooms were of a good size and clean. However try to get a room a reasonable distance from the lobby as this can be noisy especially on the weekend. All in all this hotel has the basis for being lovely. The food was good, the views gorgeous, just a little more customer service and focus would improve anyone's experience massively. Maybe the staff here should vist kanadlama or the tea factory for some tips!",negative
"Group of 9 family members stayed there and we found this hotel immaculate in every respect and the friendly staff were exceptional.The buffet both breakfast and dinner was very extensive and delicious. There were many foods to select, either local or international. There are two swimming pools, recommend the pool which is located bit far from the reception. Only bad experiance was the pool bar delay. They took 45 min for 4 cocktails and 3 potions of chips. i had to go and check two times about the delay. We had great time there.",positive
overall stay was good but property specially corridors and washrooms needs attention. beach front was amazing and swimming pools are just added advantage. I highly recommend this place to stay if you want to have calm and enjoyable vacations.,positive
"The staff were very helpful in moving us to a different room when the first one we were given was very damp & was affecting my Asthma. at first we were offered a room right next to the construction area of the hotel but the dust would have been just as bad as the damp & we were given a better option. However we had to put up with two single beds instead of a double as requested. There was a huge choice and selection of food available in the restaurants & the chefs were creative with the menu choices. Drinks took a very long time to arrive if you ordered from the bar area during the day, sometimes up to 40 minutes. we chose to upgrade to all inclusive but finding a menu with what was available to drink was near impossible. the Pool guys were super sweet and tendered to everyone's needs fetching plenty of clean towels & sourcing an umbrella for shade. the pool was spotless & they worked hard to keep it so. The security guys on the beach front were great at fending off the locals who kept calling across. they were firm but fair and just moved on the sellers when they became too loud or pushy. We loved the wildlife in the gardens and had an amusing time watching the chipmunks, birds and lizards go about their everyday life. All the staff said hello & greeted every guest. My only criticism was when we had to check out for an early pick up on departure all the lights in the hotel were off. it was pitch black at 4am in the morning with no one around. We managed to feel our way around the corridors in the dark & finally saw the emergence exit signs that gave a little light & lead us to reception. We had confirmed with reception several times and the day before that we had an early checkout but they seemed surprised when we were needing to leave so early. staying at this hotel helped us unwind after a very busy tour of the island & we enjoyed our stay.",positive
"Large, modern design hotel. Excellent restaurant and super employees. Really good food. Room probably nice once, but in urgent need of refurbishment. Internet speed fair to good. Usual tv channels, but a bit fuzzy. Our room stank of cigarette smoke and there were many burns on the furniture. Ok, our fault as we did not specify non-smoking. You may wish to. No shampoo etc. in bathroom. Minibar not restocked. Annoying 'theft-proof' hangers. Generally a bit shabby. Our 'double' was two single beds pushed together. The major issue is some second floor walkways that are seriously dangerous. Only narrow ten inch high flower trough separates you from falling to the next floor. Not good for kids. Don't touch any of the black-painted handrails, particularly if you are wearing white. The paint comes off the rail, but not off your clothes. Watch out for very slippery floors at times of high humidity. But it is not as bad as it may sound. Other than the above gripes, this is a good hotel with exceptional employees. There are some glowing reports here, so perhaps some rooms have been refurbished more recently than ours.",positive
"First of all, the staff at Ahungalla are extremely professional and very friendly, so I give them 5 stars for customer service. The general setup of the property is nice, and it has two excellent pools. The food is great, with a wide range of delicious salads, mains and deserts, with enough vegetarian choices. The rooms were generally clean, but some of the furniture was looking worn-out. We were on the 2nd floor and had a good view of the ocean. We had a strong musty smell in our room, and were told there were no air-fresheners. The linen and towels were fresh and clean. There was some construction work going on (probably a good thing in the long run!), with hammering from what sounded like above our room, however, this would start around 8am and had stopped by night-time. Good place for one night, but I think there are better options around.",positive
Good environment nice rooms friendly staff. Good food second best heritance experience behind kandalama... Nice pool with blue water.... Nice Beach too... enjoyed a nice sunset.... The hotel looks a bit old ... undergoing renovation...... how ever we thoroughly enjoyed the stay.....,positive
"Spend a night with my wife in this hotel. The room is done up so nicely. Room comes with a balcony with lounge chairs. It also has a nice view of the sea, just lovely for reading a book and watching the sunset. Food was great lots of selections. Most important thing is the service and the hospitality of the hotel staff. It was superb. Speedy free Wi-Fi (Need to get the free voucher from the reception) . Had a chance to participate in the Christmas cake mixing. It was a wonderful evening. We enjoyed the stay in Heritance Ahungalla.",positive
"We really enjoyed our stay here. The beach is stunning, although it wasn't possible to swim in the sea. However,we weren't too disappointed because both pools were great. The staff were brilliant. The food was good, but not up to the standards of heritance kandalama, where we stayed earlier in the week. Some of the inside of the hotel could also do with updating, although I think this is in progress sine there were quite a lot of workmen around during our stay. Overall, a great hotel!",positive
"We stayed 2 days in this hotel. Unfortunately the pictures on the website correspond to a long gone history. This hotel needs urgent maintenance. Especially the bathrooms, the floors, and the gardens and furniture around the pool. The people are really kind and try so hard their best, but we considered the place as a wrong choice.",negative
"What an amazing Hotel !! Staff (from the gardener till the cleaning-boy) is very friendly and proud of the Heritance. Breakfast is really unbelievable....so much choice and it tastes really good. We had B&B, so we went out for diner in Bentota (only 10 minutes with tuk tuk). Beachboys are not a problem, just a firm ""NO"" and they will not bother you any longer. If you want a really great holliday and see some special things about Sri Lanka....than ask for Raja (very good guide).....his number is: 0776954583 The Heritance is absolute the best hotel we ever had and we will definitely go back to this wonderful place.",positive
"The hotel is beautifully located on the shores of Sri Lanka Ahungalla. The entrance view of the hotel is stunning as it is open, airy, has the view of the pool and also the beach. It is stunning. The rooms are spacious and well decorated. The facilities and amenities of the hotel are good. The dinning area is good but has an unpleasant smell. The food was good but not very outstanding taste. There is a lot of room for improvement for the food and the dinning area, taste, presentation and staff servie too. The staff in the dining area need to step up. The uniform of the chief's at the live cooking station was so dirty that it was unpleasant to look at. The hotel overall has a very relaxing and soothing ambiance. It was clean and well organised. The hotel has 2 pools both have a very relaxing feel. Our stay was very short, just one day. Wish we had stayed longer.",neutral
"On arrival greeted with cool flannels and drinks, promptly checked in along with baggage to room. To our pleasure we were upgraded from a deluxe to a superior room and would recommend this upgrade would be worth the extra. Nice sized room with large glass doors and private balcony not overlooked by other residents, all very clean, complimentary bottled water and plenty of tea, coffee, sugar, milk and well stocked mini bar topped up daily, the air conditioning was easily and comfortably controllable. Bed linen and towels were changed daily, bed & pillows were very comfortable. We were in room 351 which has a perfect view of the residents only pool, surrounding grounds, foliage and the sea also less noise and traffic, it would not be so private on the ground floor, it did show a few wear & tear signs but made up for by everything else. The en suite functioned well, shower was good and no smells plenty of complimentary toiletries etc. I liked the special electrical socket that accepts just about all varieties of plugs from around the world which saves packing adaptors. The grounds were very green and well maintained, the two pools were very large and chlorine levels maintained at a level that does not blind you, the pool guys were very prompt in issuing and setting up sun loungers and there was never a shortage and as the grounds were large there was plenty of space for peace and quiet. The main buffet appeared to have a reasonable selection but I'm not keen on buffets so chose to snack in the pool bar for lunch and dine in the coffee shop personally I liked the coffee shop because they served anything from a plate of chips to a full a la carte menu or a selection of good curries and both are open 24/7 which is great. Breakfast was very good with a large selection of hot and cold foods and fresh fruit, you could even have a curry, the omelettes and eggs were cooked well and the best bacon i've had outside the UK, we were nearly always late for breakfast (due to the comfort of our beds) and were never once turned away or made to hurry like most other hotels which made for a relaxing start to the day. Most nights were spent in the Bacchus bar where there was reasonably good entertainment every night and a relaxing atmosphere which is just as well as there is nowhere else to go for miles. They had a good selection of drinks and as usual alcohol was a bit expensive especially wine but this seems to be the case in most of Asia. The staff were well presented, very helpful and friendly which helps make a holiday nothing was too much trouble for them and room service was very prompt, the laundry service was also of high standard. We did not visit any areas during our 5 night stay as we were tired having previously travelled around Sri Lank for 5 days non stop sight seeing. The beach was good and sea temperatures one of the hottest I've been in but unfortunately to rough to swim in at this time of year but able to ride the surf. The beach venders can be an issue but eventually they go away there is a marked perimeter between the hotel grounds and public beach which they are not allowed to cross it became amusing to watch their fashion show of silks, sari's and other goods. Although we were in the rainy season it only rained twice for an hour or so in the day after which only ever at night great to watch the lightening shows and helped to bring the temperature down to a reasonable level. As we checked out at 05:00 hrs and were about to get in our taxi the staff had made us a take away breakfast which was a nice gesture to end our vacation. All in all a great place to relax and a nice atmosphere would highly recommend and if I ever returned would book this hotel. A couple of small items I feel could be improved there were no bath robes unlike their sister hotel in Kandalama and very difficult to receive WiFi, certainly not in our room unfortunately although on vacation I still need to keep in touch for business reasons, it does get a bit busier at weekends when local families check in for a day or two. We did eat out twice both times at the same place the Sunshine bar 100 yards down the beach towards the rocks, sea food, lobster, tiger prawns & fish all fresh bbq'd specially for you a great way to spend a totally relaxing afternoon and at night romantic, bring your own wine as they don't have any it may look a bit dodgy but was once a two storey restaurant destroyed by the tsunami.",positive
Stayed at the hotel for two days one night on full board basis...the beach is lovely but the sea is rough in this time of the year. Not the ideal place for a sea bath. But the hotel has a very big pool to have a dip in the water. Variety of food was available. Staff was very friendly and supportive. Hotel has undergone a refurbishment but the age could be visible in some infrastructure/ toilets etc.,positive
"This hotel is one of the nicest hotels I've ever been. The personnel and staff is extremely friendly and helps whenever they can. The food is mainly local, some people hate it, others love it, but if you hate it, no problem, at the pool bar you can get burgers and fries. Room was very nice and clean, fresh towels 2 times a day and they even have a night service to open your bedsheets. Positive Points: - Friendly Staff - Nice local food - All inclusive formula is nearly perfect (will come back later to this) - Nice views of the pool - Nice, clean and big rooms - Wifi EVERYWHERE Negative Points: - All inclusive doesn't include ""light"" drinks, so as a person with Sugar disease you can not take Cola Light but only regular Cola. This is something where they should look for an alternative for people who can not have that much sugar and don't like water. - The people at the beach who try to sell you stuff, they are nice and friendly, but if you are friendly back and buy some stuff, they just keep coming asking for more, asking for drinks, milkshakes,... This is something to watch. Overall it's a very nice hotel and I will definitely come back to this one.",positive
"A fabulous piece of work by late architect Geoffrey Bawa. The entrance is very nice with the corridor running parallel. The infinity pool is nicer too. The staff, specially the front office staff is very polite and welcoming to make us feel homely. The food spread was enormous and we couldn't select what to eat. The hotel indeed needs a refurb to maintain and enhance the quality standards, but a credit goes to housekeeping for the lovely room set up. Suggest the hanging light length to have the self adjustable option as per guest wish. Nice and warm pool !",positive
"This is the second time at The Heritance Ahungalla. Guest Relation Executive (Ms Madu) and others were all too hospitable and welcoming us into the hotel. The lunch buffet had an incredible looking spread with so much options and variety. starting from General Manager until housekeeping are very friendly, we are very happy at Heritance Ahungalla Resort because we feel safe and comfortable. This is a great location for a hotel. Set on a beautiful piece of coast. We would highly recommend Heritance Ahungalla to anybody looking for a beach hotel.",positive
"we stayed 5 nights up to the 22nd sep in a luxury rated room which I upgraded to for £50 per night extra from a deluxe room they wanted £61 but a deal was done ,the room was fine good size .ac did not regulate cold or cold. in general hotel is very tired and needs a refurb,looking shabby the public areas in particular,chairs and tables in bars and restaurants are sticky thru not being cleaned properly. only really one main bar area next to main pool and reception this is completetely devoid of ambience and comforts hardly a good advert for checking in guests who are brought here. the a la carte restaurant next to the main dining room while serving reasonable food is dirty with table runners stained and dirty when restaurant manager challenged about theis he quickly had it changed the same night our food came out cold ,not good for curries!the meal was remade but it was too late the damage done,they tried to make amends with a free dessert please too little too late. the main dining room is where we took breakfast and on one occasion a buffet dinner,the tables and chairs again dirty also the table runner.food wise the breakfast is good also the dinner buffet with plenty of choices available. we tried the fine dining restaurant one night and it was very good my wife taking the new zealang beef and me the 2 fish curry price wise of course dearer than the other two dining rooms but light years superior which you would expect if you pay more but not expensive to European prices. a bone of contention ,if you have a wine list then maybe the odd bottle is out of stock,but it got to the point all that was left was the expensive wines costing £25 plus for what we get at home for £6 now I know all about mark ups but rip off! the daytime was spent by the resident only pool as this was the quietist and the pool attendant was very good at arranging our beds and towels on the same vain all the staff were very good one or two thrown in at the deep end I suspect with a poor lack of English in the restaurants. avoid the weekends as it fills up with locals on a freebie with their company and they are noisy and usually drunk playing drums at all hours. now while you are relaxing on your sun lounger near a pool you will be beckoned over to the hawkers trying to sell sarongs tee shirts or days out in a taxi,now they are not supposed to step over a line in the sand enforced by security guards but all day long they are shouting to you waving the sarongs etc,they stand on the boundary of the hotel and the beach which means the beach is a no go zone unless you don't mind saying no thank you many many times over. don't know what can be done they need to make a living you are trying to have a peaceful holiday. so to sum up after touring around sri lanka for a week we intended to chill out for 5 days didn't feel we achieved it so we do not recommend this overated hotel more 3 star.",negative
"This is a great location for a hotel. Set on a beautiful piece of coast, but seas too rough for swimming. We were welcomed by the staff, with drinks and smiles. Room was well appointed and always clean. Was great to be able to sit on the balcony and relax. Housekeeping was excellent, as was laundry service. The bar at the pool served great lunch snacks, and the ice cream was yummy. The restaurant served a variety of food, which was tasty. However the dominance of Arabs and Russians who were very rude towards women, and uncontrolled children made meal times trying! Staff in the hotel were excellent, whether reception, pool attendants, bar staff, housekeeping.",positive
Beautiful property. very comfortable rooms. the second pool away from the busy area was our favorite place to hang around. it was so quiet and peaceful. the pool attendant was so helpful. we tasted a excellent Pena colada or two ;-),positive
"We visited three Heritance Hotels during our stay. This was sadly the only one where customers were secondary to hotel maintenance. We were Woking up by hammering of temporary barriers and scaffolding at 2 am as well as loud porters moving beds all through the night. That said, the day staff were all pleasant and helpful but little thought was given to guests when they carry out maintenance work both day and night. The hotel rooms were tired and needed the work, but managed well, they could have sealed sections of the hotel rather than maintain where guests were occupying rooms.",neutral
"What can I say.. We checked in and were greeted with smiles and then after the welcome drink were escorted to the room whilst the staff engaged us in small talk to keep us feeling fresh.. When we got to the room, it was even better as the room had been decorated and it was not even our honeymoon.. Every little detailed attention was given to ensure that we were presented with a room that would make us go ""wow"".. The food, the service.. Everyone in the hierarchy down to the minor staff knew what was expected and treated us with love and care.. PS : and we were not VIP's either and have seen my share of resorts and service. Every little counts - and the hotel made sure it did more than that.. Definitely a place to relax and a place to unwind.. I call it the small piece of heaven 😉",positive
This hotel is fantastic. The rooms are great. Right by the ocean. Great pool and the staff are absolutely fantastic. All very friendly etc. But the food was below what I expected. It just wasnt that great. The choice was decent not what I expected of the buffet. Thats the only reason I have given 4 out of 5 stars.,positive
"Heritance Ahungalla has been my first choice for family trips always. It wasn't just me, my 3 year old daughter also loves this place and this is her 2nd trip to Hesitance. As you enter - As you enter the hotel, you feel the difference, you feel like you are entering an ancient sSri Lankan village. The warm welcome at the reception with a tropical fruit juice was so nice after a long drive from Colombo. The check-in was very quick and the friendly chat until you get your room keys makes you feel so at home. Room - I went on a Saturday and surprisingly, my room was upgraded to a luxury room at the third floor. The room is so spacious with a nice living room and a separated bed room with a large balcony having a superb sea view and also the pool view.. The bathrooms were very clean, and the room set-up was perfect. Pool, outdoor and entertainment – The resident's only “Green” pool is very convenient when the hotel gets crowded. My little one loves this pool and that’s one of the main reasons for her to pick Heritance for her outings. Hotel has got a large beach area with adequate security personnel being available. The lobby area during night time is eventful with live music, traditional dancing etc. Even though we stayed just one day there, we had plenty to do! Food – Simply awesome! I guess they are having an award winning chef, and since I started my meals from Saturday night, it was getting better and exiting till the Sunday lunch. My kid, who is very fuzzy about food, surprisingly enjoyed the kid's buffet and the action sea food at the buffet. Me and my wife loved the sushi and smoked salmon at the Sunday buffet so much. Hotel staff - More than anything, I think they make the difference there! Their courteous, flexible and very supportive staff provided an excellent service from the begging until we left the hotel which is above our expectation. Their Resident manager, Sampath was checking with you personally about your needs and was trying to accommodate those. Thushara, who is the restaurant manager was constantly checking with you about our dining needs from the moment you enter the main restaurant. Together, all of them made our stay very pleasant. While some hotels charge you even for a bottle of water, someone came running and put two bottles of water inside our vehicle for our journey back home. These little things makes this hotel a very special place. I wish them good luck and hoping to see them back very soon again! they are the best.",positive
"I stayed here for 3 nights with my husband, my one year old and my four year old in August. This is a lovely hotel, well maintained with great staff. Everyone was very helpful and considerate especially as I spent most of my time running after my one year old. The only let down for us was that there wasnt a kids pool - my son could only stand up on the steps of the pool which meant we were constantly on guard. The close proximity of the beach was beautiful so the kids enjoyed the playing in the sand. The buffet was good - there was a different choice every night. For lunch we ate at the pool bar which i enjoyed more. There is a very small kids club room so the kids spent a little time colouring. I would recommend this hotel for older families or couple - purely based on the pool depth.",positive
My husband and I selected heritance as our vacation spot to celebrate our anniversary along with our kids.. having kids who are 2 1/2 & 1 1/2 is usually not so relaxing :) but the staff at the hotel made it easier for us. . There was a 'kids club' activity planned out on Saturday which was quite exciting. .. the f&b staff inquired if any special food should be made for the little one. . Little gestures like these made us feel welcome... all in all we had an awesome time and many thanks to the GM and staff at heritance.. we would definitely recommend it to anyone and we will be there next year as well... :),positive
"I stayed here only one night with my family. Nice hotel for a beach holiday and unfortunately we were there during the monsoon period. Our room was 158 and it is a huge room in the corner , room was very clean , food was average. They have super friendly staff. Normaly they organize fire show in Saturday night and I enjoyed it a lot.",positive
"Last month i visited to The Heritance yet again for the 3rd time which has been superb. Staff were very warm and friendly as always & they did everything they could do to make sure my stay was a relaxing and enjoyable one. Heritance is definitely a home away from home & you feel more comfortable as you do in your own home. The service was outstanding & i enjoyed every minute of my stay. Apart from that tasty food, spotless clean room & private swimming pool...list goes on & on. Thanks for making my stay memorable :)",positive
The only thing about that hotel that I did not like was the fact that I had to leave.we were lucky to have a beautiful room with a view. The pool was nice and the ocean looked beautiful. The sandy beach was enjoyable. Staff members were polite. The food was delicious,positive
"We visited with some friends on 17th for a night's stay. We had to wait a while to check in because a lot of people were checking out as we got in. But the hotel made up for the delay by allowing us to check out late.The rooms are pleasant and comfortable with a nice view. But I had specifically asked for 2 rooms with king sized beds but were given a room with two twin beds pushed together and one room with a king bed. Not sure what happened but we didn't make a fuss. The guests- only swimming pool + hot tub is a great feature and allowed us to spend some time in the water well away from the crowds. The food was great with a good variety but the crowds were big at breakfast. We arrived a bit late but had to sit in the non-AC area because the main room was full of families. Perhaps a separate family area where bustling/running/screaming/crying kids won't annoy the rest of us would be a great idea :) We had a problem checking out as the person who was sent to check the minibar in one of our rooms claimed that 4 bottles of liquor was consumed when we didn't even touch them. We couldn't help but laugh as the cashier gentleman recited the list - ""Scotch, Cognac, Vodka and Rum"". But once we assured them that we didn't consume the liquor, they wrote it off so we didn't have to pay for it. Perhaps the management should assign more thorough staff to check the minibar upon check out. We were told by the cashier gentleman that the previous occupants in the room may have drunk the liquor and the staff didn't check properly. Yikes! Despite a few snags, it was a comfortable stay! I'd recommend this to others.",positive
"This hotel has a wonderful location right next to the beach. Adjacent to the spacious lobby there is a huge Infinity pool and just beyond that the beach starts. From the moment you enter the gate, the grounds itself are great. The hotel has two pools - one of them has a a Jacuzzi. nearby. Rooms are spacious and well appointed with small patio opening onto the garden. On Saturday nights there is a special poolside cultural show which starts at 9.30 pm - we were lucky to be able to catch it. What sets apart was the service - very friendly,courteous and warm. Somehow our special request information which was confirmed by our travel agent had not reached the hotel - but the senior front office executive immediately assured us that next day when the offices were open he would get it sorted out and he kept telling us that we should concentrate on on enjoying our stay . And true to his word , next morning we got confirmation from him that it is sorted out. Even the hotel General manager (Mr. Reehan) was very friendly and keen to listen to our suggestions.And introduced us to other key staff. The highlight of our trip was that the Sri Lanka and Pakistan cricket teams were staying there - so we got see first hand the special welcome function put up for the teams. Food was also good - on our request the restaurant even made special Sri lankan vegetarian dishes for us. The only minor improvement I would suggest to the hotel is to improve the brightness of the lighting in the bathrooms. Overall an excellent beach hotel for a relaxed holiday.",positive
"Heritance Ahungalla is a hotel i have wanted to visit since i was teenager. I had great memories of cozy bedrooms and an array of foods. Unfortunately, I went on holiday to this hotel recently and i was greatly disappointed. The suites are ridiculous and needs refurbishing, the bathrooms in the suites are laughable. The food was the only thing that lived a little bit up to expectation.",negative
"It iswoundrful experience near the beach at Heritance Ahungalla, thefoodwas excellent and there were lot of outdoor activities that we wereableto do such as a bote ride I Madu gaga river. The overall experience was great.",positive
A beautiful 5 star hotel with amazingly attentive staff and incredibly high culinary standards at every meal from gourmet dining under the stars to absolutely everything you could wish for at breakfast. The delicacies turned out from the Heritance Ahungalla kitchens would go down well in London and other international capitals; the team of chefs has a highly impressive array of skills. Infinity pools and the understated elegance of a beautifully designed hotel set in its own bay give this beach experience a unique quality to create an outstanding experience. What is exceptional is the very high quality management team and the enthusiasm and warmth of the staff that they engender. The training is clearly exceptional giving the staff the ability to move with ease from dealing with families with young children to celebrities with the same charm and attention to detail making every guest feel special. This is a gem of a hotels which thoroughly deserves its exceptional reputation to deliver a wonderful experience on every occasion.,positive
Efficient check in. Was escorted to our room by one of the staff. Bathroom floor was dirty but was cleaned promptly when we showed it. Good food and great variety. Restaurant staff bit untrained at times guessing from their behavior. Awful spelling mistakes on some of the dishes available in the buffet. Great hotel and they have maintained the high standards they are known for. Been going to this hotel for more than 20 years now.,positive
"Amazing Place. Doesn't look 30 years old and is maintained in a spic and span condition. We had a beach facing room which was an absolute delight. The staff took care of us and very very helpful until the time of our departure. Plus, they are also eco-friendly. The place is quiet and the sounds of the beach kept us in-trance for most of our stay.",positive
"Having visited the Triton, now the Heritance, 25 years ago we were pleased to see that some of the familiar places remain. The staff were very attentive and helpful. Our dinner at the Upper Room was excellent .. The food was superb and very tasty. Our large room was omfortable and our butler was very accommodating ... Nothing was too much trouble for him. It was relaxing to sit by the infinity pool and enjoy drinks then cool off with a swim.",positive
Beautiful hotel with lots of garden space. The rooms were nicely decorated. Great ambience. The staff were very helpful from the time you arrived til departure. The hotel recycles old newspapers to make gift bags. They dont use plastic. Good job!!,positive
"Let me start by saying that I agree with so many of the other reviewers: this hotel has a lot of positives: beautiful pools, steps from the beach, fantastic food, and wonderful attentive staff. That being said; there were a few basics that fell far short. I have traveled all over the world, and I have never stayed at a hotel that didn't provide wash cloths! Yes, you read it correctly, NO WASH CLOTHS!! Additionally, there was no tooth brush, toothpaste, disposable razor, individual bottles of shampoo, conditioner, lotion, slippers--items that are a must for any hotel that is in the 4 to 5 star category. The toiletries in my bathroom consisted of two shower caps, and a small box containing three q-tips and two cotton pads. Even bath mats were non-exsistent. Folded hand towels were used as a substitute. The bars of soap (one for the sink, one for the shower) were so small, after one or two showers, they were just too small to use. I'm not being picky, just pointing out the obvious. On the plus side, this hotel's exterior is stunning. Every restaurant affords a view of the ocean. Very relaxing, very open and airy. How wonderful to sit and have a cup of coffee while watching the sun rise up over the ocean ! Even though I was traveling alone, I never felt alone. The staff (from the front desk, to the wait staff), could not have been kinder or more attentive. Whenever I needed to leave the property, there was always a driver ready and willing to whisk me away via tuk-tuk (which has now become my favorite means of traveling!) All in all, the Heritance has much to offer, and as long as you remember to bring your own toiletries, your visit will be delightful !",positive
We found the stay medioco. The food was not that great and the alcohol is highly overpriced. The staff is great and very helpful. The extra family activities stated on the brochures are not available. The spa was super though. More entertainment facilities too are welcome.,neutral
a must visit. I Went in 2011 n the staff n hotel everything was amazing impeccable n makes your stay and money worth it. I haven't seen a more courteous staff than heritance. I went on the World cup and they were fully booked. even then the staff was smiling and ready to serve you.,positive
"A stunning hotel with long drive and beautiful gardens with lots of wildlife including notions, squirrels and monkeys. Our room had a large balcony and views over the sea. The pools were lovely, we used the quiet one away from the main foyer. Unfortunately we were there in monsoon season so the beach was too rough for swimming and we had the daily 30 minute storm which was an experience. The spa provides great massages and facials which we found relaxing. Meals were delicious. Beware of the local beach sharks ( locals selling goods) who trap one into walking along the beach to see a turtle only to find themselves trapped in a gem store or trapped into buying a sarong they don't want. The staff were exceptional and this was a lovely way to end our 3 week holiday.",positive
"We went here purely for relaxation The hotel is a dream, the staff is friendly and the food was fantastic. Plenty of live food counters in the buffet they were entertained our special request on food . We were able to see the kitchen & we had nice cooking class with chefs. Rooms were good and has a great antique out fit. Two pools were great option for us. We loved the place and we had a great experience for the spent and waiting to go back to the heritance ahungalla soon.",positive
"We enjoyed the most incredible personalised attention at The Heritance. Our entire experience was amazing - great food, location, service & varied experiences provided by the hotel. Amazing! We have travelled widely & this hotel is by far one of the best where we have stayed.",positive

I recently stayed at the Heritance Ahungalla with my family and level of service that we received was outstanding. Every need was catered for and every wish granted. Would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and cannot wait to return.,positive
"I am writing this over a cup of coffee from the hotel. I have visited this hotel from the days it was triton and this officially concludes my 8th visit to this place (yes thats right !) And i am not joking ! Why so many times well two things always bring us back , one is the food and next is the service and fllexibilty. So this makes it my first visit for this year and believe or not i m due there in september as well. Over the years this hotel was able keep up as one of the trendiest in the vicinity however now it seems to lack behind. The food was once heavenly but now let me simply say "" not as heavenly"" . We were always amazed by the weekend dinner barbecue but this time it was highly dissapointimg and disorganised. We always loved the jumbo prawns and lobster (cray fish) that they always did have . but this time the stock seemed old and frozen . Worst of all the buffet spread never seemed to be re filled . Todays breakfast , i had to tell more than 3 jr chefs to re fill the bacon and it took them 20 mins. So yeah alot of negatives seemed to be observed by our group of friends who have just like me been patriots of this establishement. Rooms seemed to have changed very little. Some rooms seemed to be well stock with all the essentials some rooms seemed to lack a few things e.g bottle openers tea /cofee refills and glasses . However for a person visiting for the first time this perception can definitely differ . This was written with a lot of dissapointment and heart break hope the management will be able to revive this place before it becomes uncontrollable ( not that it is bad ) . Ps one thing that has never ever changed is the friendly staff so kudos for that. Love how pleasant everybody is ! C u soon as always :)",negative
"The five star Heritance Ahungalla, a stylistic blend of concrete and the natural in the most seamless manner without the slightest hint of any encroachment on nature which is one of the famed architect Gefforey Bawa’s classics. It boasts of 152 rooms and is located on the southwest coast of Si Lanka that constitutes a place for ultimate enjoyment. Being at the hub of the south coast it offers exciting getaways to the tour the adjacent Madhu Ganga, see the Kosgoda Turtle Hatchers or visit the splendid Galle town. As the guest approaches the hotel through the winding road line with swaying coconut palms greet and green turf beckons, the eye wanders to the luxuriously appointed expanse of the lobby and the infinity pool just ahead of it which is strategically built in line with the eye and beyond it the blue waters of the Indian Ocean lying yonder stretches from horizon to horizon, and is most often dotted with sailing crafts. All the rooms offer panoramic sea views and scrumptious buffets are available to delight and tickle the taste buds. The main restaurant is dedicated to a particular theme very often and offers a unique cuisine to enjoy. Dining in the Upper Room is available with some exotic and unusual options and the Heritance special menu is a must try. The service is superlative and the staff clad in printed batik attire and management very courteous and polite and goes out of their way to make the guests comfortable. This hotel is famous for the rich tapestry of accolades it has earned and continues to be a flagship hotel of the south coast and has reached the Green Globe benchmark certification for wholesome environmental practices and continues its energy saving thrust in being a good exemplar to the entire hospitality trade of Sri Lanka.",positive
This was our first time visiting heritance ahungalle and we were looking forward to a relaxing weekend. First up when we arrived our room wasn't ready and even though I had specifically requested for a king size bed since we were travelling with our son instead of individual beds this too was not taken into account. After sitting in the lobby for over 30 minutes we were finally taken up to our room . The luggage however was not brought to the room and after waiting a good 30 minutes we had to go looking for it. As for the food we found it to be basic and lacking in flavour. Breakfast was much better as it had a variety with many local dishes and seasoning. I found it bizarre that very little seafood was on the menu being a sea side hotel. The staff were attentive and went to the extent of asking if anything special was required for our son. Location is beautiful and rooms are good. Need to improve in food and urgency of staff In getting things done.,neutral
"This hotel is the best in Sri Lanka. We spent four nights and the location, suite, food and service can not be faulted. When we arrived we were greeted by Dayal at the pool bar. He looked after us in every way possible and organised a night for us in the fine dining restaurant and also a dining experience on the beach. The food was the best we had in Sri Lanka and in particular the seafood was amazing. He also organised a kitchen tour and we met the chefs. An amazing experience. The other staff were also just as fantastic and in particular Sudesh, Lakshitha and Kusum also made our experience an amazing one during breakfast, lunch and dinner within the restaurants.The two swimming pools are immaculate and it was a hard choice each day on which we would swim in. I cannot fault this hotel. It is a totally amazing experience staying there. All the staff bent over backwards to ensure our stay was perfect. Will be the first hotel I book on my next Sri Lankan visit. Highly recommended!",positive
"Reading all these wonderful reviews on tripadvisor, it was a no brainer when i had to pick up a beach side hotel in Sri Lanka for 14 of us planning a one week official conference. However I have come to realise the hard way that what works for tourist is not necessarily that good for official travel ! Rooms: Positives: - Rooms are decently sized and well stocked with balconies outside. Perfect for tourists ! - They put flowers on the bed every evening when room is cleaned up Negatives: - No slippers on the sandy non carpet floors - No toothpaste - Imagine flowers on a double bed for two colleagues sharing the room - When we asked for arranging rooms with two single beds, we were given a room with two joint single beds - when asked for separate bedsheets, pullovers and blankets, they threw an extra blanket on the joint double sheet covers Restaurants: Positives: - A good choice of small bars, fine dining and a well stocked buffet restaurant - Excellent choice of food, well stocked bars and very tasty food on the buffet for all 3 meals Negatives: - I ordered beefeater gin on a night when we were all high on beer. They gave me something that tasted like acid. When i asked to see the bottle they showed me a Gordon's. Being a regular gin drinker i knew this was neither beefeater nor Gordon's but was some local gin served and billed at higher rates, but could not quantify this and hence had to roll back to beers. Pool / Gym: Positives: - 2 well sized pools, one scenic & facing the ocean - One jacuzzi next to the pool is a good touch Negatives: - Gym is stocked with rusting weights and age old equipment. It is better to not have one than having something dilapidated Conference Rooms: Positives: - None Negatives: - Old smelly stuffy conf room with a noisy air conditioner - Mints and dry fruits kept in the room on day one where not changed or filled in for next 5 days Service level: Positives: - Extremely warm staff, but nothing extraordinary compared to other places like maldives or kerala or Goa Negatives: - No personalization basis type of guests (tourists vs those on official trips) - Was kept waiting for an hour during check in - Bill was inflated during checkout and I had to involve our booking agency who had to argue and show proofs that the hotel was double charging me for something that the agency had already prepaid ! Overall recommendation: It is a good property isolated from rush of bigger / commercial areas and its bang on the beach. You should def try this as part of your srilanka trip ""if"" and only if you are tourists. Stay away if you plan office offsites or conferences in Sri Lanka !",positive
"Me and my wife stayed here for 3 days and we really enjoyed the stay.very professional staff and great service. They have an extensive buffet featuring different cuisine.rooms are huge and you get a nice sea view and you can smell the sea breeze, awesome!! Try in room breakfast in mornings and smell the fresh air you'll love it!",positive
My husband and I visited this hotel for our anniversary celebrations last week. We enjoyed each and every minute of our two day stay. Staff was friendly and helpful. We truly had a memorable time here. The food was delicious and they had plenty of variety of breakfast and dinner. We had a room overlooking the pool area and we enjoyed the view and comfort of the room. They have two pools and as other reviewers had pointed out the second pool is more secluded if you want privacy. The main pool overlooks the sea and there is always vendors waiting to sell something to the hotel guests. Overall a pleasant experience in Ahungalla.,positive
"I wrote the review earlier when I said this was a lovely hotel but spoilt by the guests. It seems only fair to revisit that review in the light of the rest our stay and the efforts made by the management to address our concerns. Apart from one disappointing day the rest of our holiday was bliss- and the response from the General Manager to my review typified how hard everybody worked to make our stay special. It's a wonderful hotel, beautiful location and fantastic food (particularly when the focus is on Sri Lankan food). The sunsets are the stuff of films. What makes this hotel stand out above many others is the staff. They are unfailingly helpful, polite and utterly charming. It is difficult to pick out one from the many who made our stay so memorable but I want to make a special mention of Madhu, who was so patient with our beginners' Sinhala and helped create some special memories. Go to the Heritance and enjoy the view, the charm, the food, spectacular pools and sunsets and most if all the people working within the hotel who work hard to make any stay extremely special. We felt very welcome and will be back.",positive
"We had 2 nights at Heritance Ahungalle, and this was just what we needed! The best service we have ever experinced. Everybody are so nice and polite and if you need something it's your own foul 'cause you get provided literally 24/7! The food was an experince for it self! Really a professional and good cuisine. From the local srilankan dishes to international food as sushi, lobster, burger and I could keep going. Both the buffet and in room dining. You can get anything you can imagine. Without a doubt a place we would love to visit again and recommend to all.",positive
"Such beautiful architecture, the layout is amazing - the integration of trees and water. That's just the start. The staff here were some of the friendliest we found in SL and nothing was a problem. The hotel has great facilities and the food we had while here was fantastic - so many choices on offer. Highly recommended.",positive
"We stayed for 2 nights with family and experienced a very comfortable stay. Kudos to the extremely hospitable and accommodating staff who were the X factor in a beautiful but decently average property(maintenance-wise),which looks like it will need some renovations(interior) in the near future. Being local we were not impressed by the costs of the extras which were geared more towards the foreign purse! Room rate on FB basis was of extremely good value. Overall very satisfied with the experience and would highly recommend!",positive
"This is my 5th visit to this hotel. Like always ""Great friendly staff great food! "". I always love the way they welcomed us to the hotel. It was a very nice experience, with the 2 huge swimming pools near the beach and the nice buffets with a large variety of foods to taste. We played tennis for almost 2 hours with a fee of Rs. 400 per hour. We did enjoy our game but they must resurface both tennis courts(clay). The rooms were very comfortable in few years back, but unfortunately not now. It was terrible dirty and smells like cockroach. The building really need to renovate to keep up with changing times and tastes We used to love our stay in this hotel!!!",negative
Excellent place to spend the holiday. Superb hospitality and the food also excellent. Location also in a calm and cool place. Supper view to the Sea. Just 1 n half hr from colombo......................,positive
"So a lovely resort, with 2 beautiful pools, great service and excellent rooms. Loved our experience. Right on the beach, the bar and coffee shop are a delight to chill at. The game room, library and spa are an added bonus. The pool with a tree! what a concept and what an experience. Definitely recommend it and will be going back soon!",positive
We found the restaurant staff to be very friendly and hospitable. Nothing was too much trouble. They were interesting to talk to and showed us full attention. They are to be fully complimented on their professionalism.,positive
"We stayed at the Heritance Ahungalla from 21st June to 23rd. It was not the first time we stayed in Heritance hotels, however the experience which we gained at the Heritance Ahungalla was second to none. We were met by the Resident Manager and Front Office Manager who were very warm and extremely acccomodating . We were a group of seven guests and my two toddlers who also were given the full attention by the lobby staff which added to a great experience. The choice of food consisting Eastern and Western Dishes were phenomenal. The taste, quality and quantity were fabulous and mouth watering. The Executive chef including all of his team, went above & beyond our expectations. As I had two toddlers with me I was unsure how they could prepare the baby meals,however they could not have been more helpful than they were. Kitchen staff were very friendly, and the service they provide to us was excellent. In a nutshell, the total experience in Hertance Ahungalla was unforgettable and we hope to see you again in next year. We have a large group of friends & colleagues who we will be making sure they know what a wonderful hotel that we have been to & we have no hesitation of recommending it to them We would like wish staff our sincere gratitude for an amazing two days which ended far to quickly.We look forward of seeing you again in the future. Lots of Love Denise Huggett, Gemma Hartman, Ivy Sparkes and M Munaweera",positive
"The Heritance hotel is a combination of excellent service and a fantastic property! The Hotel's location, facilities and service are really very very good! We were a group of 12 people who spent 2 nights there (21& 22/Jun/14). The Service is really good, the staff are polite and helpful without being intrusive. The room we stayed in was one of the older ones near the Spa. The newer rooms in the main blocks are superior; that being said these rooms are not bad at all. Being a Vegetarian the food choices were limited. The staff went out of their way to accommodate us, they added extra curries to the platter we ordered and were extremely helpful. The limited options were delicious! A special note for the beach. The sands are soft and clean. There are enough activities around to keep anybody occupied. One disappointment: The spa treatments could be better for the price I would highly recommend this place!",positive
"This is a very quiet resort located away from the town.there is pretty much nothing to do around here other than lazing by the pool and the beach.The sunset here is awesome.The hotel is a bit old and i would not rate it as a 5 star hotel.the view was nice but the room was poor and give you the feeling of the 80s starting from the key to the furniture,the ac,the toilets...The main buffet restaurant is extremely tired.We stayed on a half board basis so ate at the hotel a lot and the quality of the meals was a bit inconsistent.The breakfast buffet was very limited.The first night dinner buffet was also limited but the next night was great because of new guests form arabian countries!!!!it was the best meal we had during our whole stay in this hotel!!!Live music every night was enjoyable.High speed free wifi was excellent.The room boy had mad an elephant with bath towels on bed.Thanks A Lot",neutral
"A quick drive from Colombo,a great choice if you are planning a trip with bunch of long lost friends . Good food, friendly staff and a lot of things to do while you are there.The range of food is better on weekends I guess so try to plan your trip accordingly.",positive
We were at heritance ahugalla for Two days on the 21st and 22nd of June 2014. While the other aspects of our stay was satisfatory the food was HORRIBLE and maybe even nearing on Atrocious!! In all meals the food was actually flavor less... the worst part is that most of us had to suffer from food poisoning and purging the same day! I will definitely never visit this hotel again and will definitely advise all of my friends and family to never go there even if it was the last place on earth!! solely because there was something that was seriously wrong with the food in that hotel So please if anyone of you are thinking of going there... Think again,negative
"My husband and I visited Heritance, Ahungalla last week (on a week day), for a one night stay. We were pleasantly surprised by the warmth of the staff and the beauty of the hotel. It's obvious that the hotel itself is a bit old, but this will hardly cross your mind when you see its location which allows breathtaking views of the sea. The residents pool towards the north wing of the hotel is great, secluded and shady enough for an afternoon dip. The food was excellent. All in all, a great stay. Special mention must be made of Amila and Shehan who went out of their way to show us a good time.",positive
"We stayed for 5 nights at Heritance Ahungalla as part of Emirates Holidays Best of Sri Lanka tour. Upon arrival on the Saturday night we were at first a little taken aback with the number of people in the infinity pool/reception area where we were welcomed with the traditional hot towels and fresh fruit drink. The receptionist explained that there was a lot of activity because they have local families staying at the weekends in the low season and that by Sunday afternoon there would only be a handful of guests - which was correct. Our room on the 3rd floor overlooked the private swimming pool (which was quiet) and the Indian Ocean - fantastic view. Saturday night was busy in the buffet restaurant however the food and service was excellent. Sunday we were in the restaurant with only 2 other couples! All the staff were always extremely polite, professional and couldn't help you enough - but without crowding you. Always greeted us with a wave and a smile and asking how we were, this included the room service, reception, waiters, pool attendant and security guards - we were even invited to tour the kitchens and the chocolate museum. We went onto the beach - the only drawback was being asked if we'd like to see turtles and being led down the beach only to find we were being taken to see the local restaurant and other business ventures! so be prepared to be misled - although they were amicable - almost begging us to go to their shops etc. - it was the low season and they do need to make a living as well. The hotel was very clean, comfortable, spacious and the wildlife in the rounds included kingfishers, and many other birds, squirrels and iguanas which kept us amused with their antics and being chased from the lawns by the gardeners! Thoroughly recommend this hotel.",positive
Heritance Ahungulla was everything that can be expected from a top class Hotel on the beach at south western Sri Lanka. We would not hesitate to recommend it and we would love to come back. The ambience and service was exceptional.,positive
"I took my wife here for her birthday, and boy was this place a treat! 1. The architecture of the hotel bears the hallmark of its creator - It was designed by the legendary geoffrey bawa and its a beautiful work of art. 2. The service was the best I've experienced in any hotel. The staff makes you feel like really special. And I have to commend Indika (The front office Manager) and Shehan who really went out of their way to make our stay memorable. All hotels can learn a lot from these two and their style of doing things. They are indeed two of the finest I've met. 3. The food - the fine dining restaurant deserves a review of its own. The food was 1st class. Then again, I'm told this hotel has an award winning culinary team. 4. Other facilities - if you're staying here, use the resident's pool- gotta love the secluded setting and the jacuzzi. All in all, probably the best hotel stay I've ever had. Will be returning soon!",positive
What a fantastic place to relax! First class service and great facilities. Highly recommend Heritance to anyone wishing visit southwest of Sri Lanka. Beautiful and clean beach. Popular with 'high-end' visitors. We had a very happy time and enjoyed everyminute.,positive
"A great hotel in a beautiful place. I was very impressed and satisfied with the place, service and the food. Specially Sri Lankan breakfast. That was how I expected Sri Lankan food to taste like after being away from home for so long. I would highly recommend this place.",positive
We had a super time ! good quality time with our friends and family. can recommend to anyone. Food was excellent and lot of variety to choose. pool was excellent when you travel with young children and need very little supervision.,positive
"WOW...what a hotel foods, location, service, entertainments, quality... perfect hotel. Highly recommend for every one....The best hotel i traveled in down south. I traveled with my friends in 2011 and i had a very good time..thankx.....",positive
"Absolutely wonderful! The resort was a tranquil haven set away from the busy main road and made you feel like you have just stepped into paradise. The hotel is beautifully laid out, allowing you to go from swimming in the pool to swimming in the ocean with just a few steps along a very private beach. The architecture is stunning. The hotel had a wide array of amenities like 2 pools (one with Jacuzzi), bars, restaurants, a library, tennis court, spa, putting green, gym, loads of games, etc which I felt made it ideal for either couples or families. There were always activities for both children and adults like mask painting, water aerobics, traditional dances, etc but they were unobtrusive, allowing you to either be entertained or just relax in peace around the pool, without being bothered. The rooms were beautiful, comfortable and cleaned spotlessly every day. The service was outstanding with smiling happy faces greeting you wherever you go. Nothing seemed too much trouble to do and they made you feel like you were part of the family, not just an anonymous guest. Special thanks to KK who made us feel like we were royalty every day and went out of his way to help us experience Sri Lankan culture. The food was spectacular with a wonderful mix of Sri Lankan and international dishes. We were mad about the Egg hoppers and wonderful Sri lankan curries with their endless choice of sambals, chutneys, pickles, pitu, etc. This is a wonderful escape that makes you feel absolutely pampered every step of the way.",positive
"We booked 3 rooms for 6 adults and 3 kids. Two rooms were very spacious and comfortable. Third room was normal Deluxe type - but very comfortable. Not sure how we ended up getting the extra-large rooms, but very happy about it! Service was excellent with lots of friendly staff looking after all the guests with enthusiasm. Very friendly atmosphere. TT table and rackets need a desperate upgrade. But we managed to play a few nice games. Great food! Will plan to again..",positive
"Good nice hotel, beach and the main pool were lovely.. our kids enjoyed a lot. rooms were small compaired to some other hotels and was not 100% clean as we found dust in corners of the room. lovely food with varities. friendly staff. overall we had a good stay.",positive
"A brilliant location for a hotel. The views from the first floor rooms that have views of the beach are majestic. The restaurant caters for every taste, the curries are spicy and delicious. The staff are very attentive to every need. We enjoyed 9 nights at this hotel and could have stayed for 99. Highly recommended. Must you must reserve an ocean view room to take full advantage of this location.",positive
Stayed here for 3 days on a company off-site. It's a sprawling property about 3 hours drive from the Colombo airport. Very beautifully designed with a private beach and a good pool. The best part is the food - they a very wide assortment in their buffet which has a local taste as well. One negative is that there is nothing much to see closeby in terms of sightseeing.,positive
"we stayed at this hotel during April 14. really had a great time and the ambiance, food, comfort and the overall experience was excellent. we have decided to stay here for a longer period as soon as we can find some time to fit in. food at the buffet breakfast was varied and delicious. they had special spread for diabetic patients and it was really really tasty. live counters were fast and good. in the restaurant there is a person by the name darsana....he was very very kind and good. made us feel special. (actually he was like that with everyone)..all in all a great experience. if you want to unwind and relax totally, this is the place to be...",positive
"We travelled around Sri lankas west and middle areas due to my son playing cricket. We stayed in 7 different 5 star resorts on our trip, and none came close to this place. The staff were exceptional, and the cooking was of the highest including a tour of their award winning kitchen that was amazing, and a must if you can get an offer. The two pools are by far the best we saw. Shallow pools for mucking around in, and deep pools for having fun.I would come back here at a moments opportunity. My one complaint is the townsfolk who hover at the edge of the resort and do not take no for an answer, but they can be kept away with a stern no about three times. Maybe four times. This place though was the highlight a great and informative trip. Some resorts are so modern they are unfriendly, but this is old enough to have style and in good enough condition to impress.",positive
"My husband and I had 2 magical nights away at Ahungalla in between our busy wedding week in Dec 13. We were incredibly well looked after from the moment we arrived. From the welcome drinks in the foyer to the quick and friendly check-in, the staff were always polite, friendly and helpful. We were very pleased to have received an upgrade to our room with a lovely view. The swimming pool, beach access and general atmosphere all contributed to a wonderful stay but the highlight of the trip has to be the amazing food! All three meals were of a very high standard, we were very impressed and thoroughly spoilt for choice. I will gladly go back to Heritance Ahungalla anytime I visit Sri Lanka in the future!",positive
Located in a good place near to the sea. Love the pool very much. had a good welcome. excellent service by all the staff. Less varieties of food. Rooms are in good condition but not much space in the bathroom.,positive
"We do an annual getaway with my parents and stayed at this beautiful property for two nights this time. The service, warmth and general demeanour of the staff was outstanding, making this the best vacation we've had in any property in Sri Lanka. A definite recommend to others who visit in the future",positive
"We stayed here based on recommendations from friends who said that the hotel was excellent; I couldn't agree more. It was my birthday and members of staff went out of their way to make it a memorable stay and were always accommodating, friendly and helpful. Our room was spacious and comfortable. The food at the buffet was great; plenty of choice and very good quality. We also experienced private dining on the beach; I would thoroughly recommend this experience to anyone looking for something special. It was an exceptional meal in a beautiful setting. All in all, I would thoroughly recommend this hotel.",positive
"The location and layout of this hotel is very nice. This was my third or fourth visit and as before, the rooms were clean, spacious and comfortable and the staff pretty helpful and friendly. This hotel is a popular choice for families due to its proximity to Colombo so expect it to be fairly crowded all year round.",positive
Best set of staff I have had for a long time. Always willing to go extra 2 miles to make you comfortable. Our 3y son had so much attention worried he'd expect that at home from his two very busy parents who got a very good vacation!,positive
This is our first time in HA. We stayed there Two nights.. What a pleasant surprise!! This is a beautiful place that you would want to come again.I can't fault anything of this hotel. Excellent Staff. Excellent food & service. I enjoyed every minute . Everything was perfect. But Stay away from beach hawkers. Thanks for the management & staff for making our stay a very pleasant one...,positive
"The staff are so polite and helpful, including the restaurant manager, the lifeguard and the reception staff. The room Was clean and comfortable with a lovely beach view. The food was very good, the staff couldnt be more helpful offering to make you anything that was not available already. The chefs were really polite and friendly. The pool was lovely in particular the second pool. We watched a lovely wedding on the beach. We only stayed 4 days but were really sad to leave.",negative
"We booked our 2 day stay after reading the good reviews but were a bit unsure if we would get the same watered down treatment we received in a hotel in Sri Lanka which had good reviews from foreign tourists and where we stayed last year. Although living in Australia for 22 years we do not exactly have a ""foreign"" accent, having been born in Sri Lanka we speak the local language which gives us away to the local staff who generally love to pamper the foreign tourists only. What impressed us in this hotel was that the staff made no distinction between the local tourists and the visitors from overseas, and we were well looked after from the time we arrived. Checking in was very friendly, no standing at the reception, but a staff member escorted us to a sitting area and we were offered a choice of freshly squeezed fruit juice. While we enjoyed our complimentary wood apple juice, we were checked in by the staff member. After we finished our drink, we were actually escorted to our room by this staff member who conversed with us in perfect English and told us about the hotel amenities. We had booked a luxury room with balcony and ocean view, and the room was very comfortable. We enjoyed the view from our balcony usually after waking up in the morning, sipping a cup of tea before heading down to the restaurant for breakfast. The food was really good, the restaurant staff smiled as they approached us. We were even asked to let them know if there was anything we would like to have that was not in the menu, and they did actually oblige with my wife's request for grilled seer fish on Kebab night. We were hoping for a quiet relaxed stay during the middle of the week away from busy Colombo where we had spent most of our Sri Lankan holiday, and we had exactly that. The only thing that wasn't to our liking was the persistence of the hawkers on the beach. My wife bought a sarong that looked quite nice from one of them, however this appeared to be a mistake because that enticed the rest of them to keep following us although we very firmly told them we were not interested in buying something from each one of them. Probably there was nothing much the hotel could do about them. Just one other thing and this is about the bathroom. This was very spacious and we liked it very much, however, the louvered blind on the glass wall adjacent to the bath tub wouldn't shut properly. Not quite sure if this is a deliberate gesture by the management to promote intimacy between couples using this room!",neutral
"I am surprised at the number of glowing reviews this hotel has received. Either my wife and I were unlucky, too hard to impress, or other reviewers for this hotel were being too kind. Ill start with the positives. The hotel grounds are very nice, the pool is excellent, the location right on the beach very nice. The rooms are ok, they have everything you might expect or want. Nothing more or less. However this hotel seems to follow the usual business model you find in these types of regions. Hire the cheapest staff you can find, provide only the basic training, charge the guests international rates, make a fortune on high margins. Staff were slow and spoke very little english. They cannot engage in conversation which is frustrating when you need to ask about the local area, request extra food items, or anything you might require. There was no imagination, such beautiful grounds yet no outdoor BBQ for guests during the day or night, outdoor pool bar, or even music. And then there is the idea of apparent supplementation of hotel income by allowing corporate/local guests in with their families in tow on weekends. About 20 screaming kids in the pool and all the deck chairs taken forcing guests like myself to retreat somewhere else. I just dont expect this at a hotel that wants be considered in the luxurious category. Food was overpriced for the quality. It was fine, just not what you would expect for the price. Staff would take away an empty bottle and just fail to ask if you wanted another. Basic stuff. Staff are just in a constant state of apathy. I found myself having to look for the barman, find the guy to bring my wife and I the towels for the pool area. They were just never where you wanted them to be. When you did they were slow and emotionless. And the hawkers waiting outside the hotel limits on the beach. I mean that put me off straight away. We couldnt go anywhere without being accosted by these people. If I want a poorly made garment Ill go the street market myself thanks. Other guests actually hesitated walking on to the beautiful beach just so they didnt have to interact with these people. How is that fair? Upon checkout, my wife and I sat in the lobby area for 35 minutes as we waited for our driver and werent offered a single beverage/refreshment. Guess once you check out you arent worth the time anymore? Given so many of us only have only a few weeks a year allotted for holidays due to work commitments, its heartbreaking not getting what you think you are paying for. I think the Heritance Ahungalla has become complacent due to all the kind reveiws. When compared to the surrounding area it is 5 star quality, but internationally its 3 star at best. Its not a bad hotel at all, just not that great. Therefore I gave it an ""average"" rating as its simply average. UPDATE: We have just checked in to the Fortress in Galle and it makes the Heritance look even worse. I wish we hadnt bothered with Ahungalla at all now. Im sure Ill get some half-hearted response from the management regarding my critique as they have done to others. I would have given it to them personally had they asked, but they never did.",negative

"Amazing hotel, very friendly and helpful staff. Our two night stay with a 3 year old was very relaxing as we had plenty to do, two pools and a wonderful beach kept us all busy and happy. My daughter loved the traditional dancers and the evening event and still talks about it. Food is great, you have a lot of choice at the jute buffet, the in room dining is great too as you can sit in you balcony and enjoy a meal in comfort. The hotel was fully booked on our weekend stay, but still got a hot dinner served in room withing 20 minutes which I thought was good!. The hotel is set slightly away from a town, so for longer stays and wondering about you may have to walk about half km to get the the gates to access the main road, and would struggle to get about on own if you are not a local. You can get a tuk tuk, without much difficulty during the day. I would like to thank the staff and management for the wonderful time we had and would love to stay again on our next holiday! I found it is a nice touch that senior members from Management team Mr Razeen, Mr Sampath and celebrity Chef Mr Kumarasinghe spent time meeting and speaking to guests in the evening without sitting in offices. I felt it was nice that they cared about how guests felt and they were easy to access if you had concerns. Thank you!",positive
"A beautiful location and a wonderful hotel for a relaxing holiday. We found the staff very attentive and nothing was too much trouble, with their infectious smiles you can´t help but feel at ease in this location. When we arrived and looked through the reception area and saw the beach we realised we had come to a special place and we were not disappointed during our stay. Great variety of food available from the daily buffet, although there are other restaurants to use or arrange an evening dinner on the beach. We would have no problems recommending this hotel to others and are looking forward to returning..",positive
"This is the most difficult review I have written so far. The hotel has two parts – one is brilliant and another is terrible. Therefore I summed everything up and evaluated it as average. Brilliant points: Extensive, very clean beach with clean ocean water. Fantastic pool area (two pools fit for any taste) with very good service. Nice reception, pleasant and airy open lobby. Beautiful grounds with veritable zoo: variety of birds, squirrels, shy langur monkeys, almost friendly molitors, etc. Superb food both at evening and morning buffet. Terrible points: Rooms and bathrooms are outdated, dirty, smelly (sometimes smell of sewage is overwhelming) and ill-kept, some may be cockroachy. After one night I asked to change my room on the ground floor which totally awful to only slightly better on the first floor (at least with more light). Housekeeping is poor: rooms are not cleaned until very late and then, several hours later, in the evening there comes house keeping again for god knows what reason. Also in the dining area at one point the floor was slippery because of spilt fat and remained so for at least two days. Hotel spa prices are more than exorbitant, go for massage to the village. Beware when dealing in cash: bad exchange rate (and different than told at the reception) the cashier cheats (tried to swindle me and one of our group too), so count your money carefully. Even when in the hotel grounds (and especially on beach) you are periodically accosted by touts, seller of various goods, tuk tuk drivers, etc. If you leave the grounds and go to the village you are immediately swarmed with “helpers” who tussle between themselves and finally you will have one fixed “leach” who will follow all the time offering all kinds of goods and services. So, if you are indifferent to the room you sleep in, the hotel is perfectly all right, even great. But otherwise consider other possibilities.",negative
"Its a beautiful place, but we missed the hotel coming because their was no sign going towards Colombo. So we had to drive back to get to the hotel. The rooms were good and spacious, but the TV has to be in a better angle as it wasn't facing the bed. The food was very good, and had a lot of variety to choose from. The toilets were big and clean, which was a great thing. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The beach was a bit rough but very good. We definitely will visit this hotel again.",positive
"very clean, quiet place with super friendly staffs. Breakfast and dinner superior. Lunch we did not take. From our side a 100% recommandation. If possible we would choose this Hotel again. Never hade more friendly and polite staffs before",positive
"Room= nice bed, good view nice balcony alot of ants though. Kind of a walk and no lift. Spacious. NO IRON. Bathroom= overall good bathroom clean and we'll equipped. Restaurant= A La carte= expensive for pasta and one pasta looked freshly made other looked like it had been in the microwave and it was disgusting even the waiter said it wasn't good.But didn't care. Kind pushy for us to get drinks when we specified water 3 times. Food took 2 long and like I said quality was bad. Buffet= nice buffet girl was good and since my wife didn't eat just wanted pineapple she said it was ok and let us just get pineapple and one buffet so she was friendly. Really good variety and service was good. Breakfeast= breakfeast was ok. Only happy person was the one making our waffles this was April 27 by the way. He was answering our questions and was good at what he was doing always working. Asked for late check out and got it til 2 thank you very much. And also check out was the worst. Fyi always get an outside cab hotel gets you a cab. EXPENSIVE and not worth it. And waited 20 minutes for my bags to come down( the lift is only for them). Beach however is awesome just people trying to sell u things as soon as u put one foot out the hotel. Beach was empty so perfect only me my wife and like 2 other people. Awesome beach.",neutral
"Rooms are not clean at all, I was waiting to see all type of animals but not mouses passing near the rooms.it smell really disgusting especially when u are in the breakfast and dinner and u don't have anything to eat even cheese is crispy because of the long time stay outside! Don't hesitate to choose another hotel!!!",negative
"From the moment you walk into this hotel, you can enjoy everything that is on offer. Service quality is exceptional, staff are well trained and are very courteous. Rooms are spacious and clean. Awesome food. I have been going this this hotel on and off for more that ten years and I never get sick of the place. Great hotel and great location.",positive
We stayed here five nights at the end of January. It was a friendly welcoming place and we had a lovely relaxing time enjoying the sun sea and beach. Beautiful pool and sandy beach. I can't find a fault about this place. All the food we had here was great and there are good selection of food everyday. A special thanks to the young chef Vikasitha who was very attentive and kind enough to cook me some Sri Lankan curries to my request. We occupied room 335 and our room boy Priyantha was a polite chap and make sure the room was clean at all time. We would highly recommend this hotel. A very welcoming place with friendly polite and attentive staff.,positive
"Just came back from two weeks in HA. This is a lovely hotel and we cannot add too much to the previous positive reviews but just would like to share some of the points that we think worth to be mentioned. Location. This is the most important thing that needs to be considered if you plan to choose this hotel. The thing is that it is unexpectedly isolated. Most of the beach side hotels in Sri Lanka (especially such big as HA) have a developed touristic infrastructure just outside their entrance doors - shops, travel agencies, restaurants, etc. HA is not the case. Here you can find only two restaurants on the beach and … that’s all. Needless to say that the prices for everything (from taxi to excursions) are the same or just a bit less than in the hotel. Just as an example we found out that ordering a room service dinner is cheaper than going to the restaurants. So, be prepared. At the same time the good point is that the Beach is just perfect. Because the hotel is so isolated the whole huge shore line is used only by the guests. This is the advantage that cannot be underestimated. Rooms Rooms are Ok. Not bad but nothing special. We were staying in the luxury room on the second floor. All floors have all types of rooms, but the third floor is considered ‘special’ and costs some extra money. We asked for relocation to the third floor but were explained that we needed to pay a difference. As it was written in the other reviews only the third floor had a full sea view. The second and first have it only partial. This does not mean that the view is bad – no, you’ll be overlooking the big (really big) and nice (really nice) pool or picturesque garden with monkeys and varans . Position HA stands rather far away from the main touristic attractions of the central and southern Sri Lanka. If you want to see something you should expect to get up at 5 or 3 a.m. to spend a whole day in the car. The trip from the airport takes around 2.5-4 hours. When you negotiate with taxi it is advisable to make it clear from the very beginning that the price include highway fee. If you do not choose highway be ready to spend 4 hours in the permanent traffic jam on the local road. Conclusion Would I recommend this hotel? Yes, why not. It is well maintained, stylish and relaxing. If you like the beach relaxation, travel with a kid or just want to have a break after exploring the island HA might be a good option. Would I come back? No, next time we’d rather choose some of the hotels on the south closer to Galle.",positive
"This is a late review owing to my not having Internet until the last few days. I stayed with my partner at Heritance Hotel for the first two weeks in February and it was one of the most memorable experiences ever. We stayed as 'all-inclusive' guests on a Kuoni trip and from the moment of arrival - frazzled from an 11-hour flight and a 3-hour rush hour taxi ride - we were able to relax - bags, thirst and hunger taken care of by an obviously motivated and attentive staff. Our room was fabulous, with a balcony overlooking the Indian Ocean and throughout our stay we were constantly pampered by attendants, room service and the staff of the bar just along the landing. Everything about the Heritance is five-star. The management is always available to assist, the bar and restaurant staff are simply marvellous and each and every one of the highly-skilled chefs is happy to talk to you about what they do. I was actually given a tour of the extensive and spotless kitchens by one chef whom I befriended. I reckoned the buffet tables in the restaurant were over 40 metres total length and the choice of food was simply phenomenal, as was the quality. The Spa offers treatments such as massage, manicures and pedicures at extremely reasonable cost, and like everywhere else in the hotel, the staff are wonderful. The location of the hotel makes it easy to visit nearby attractions and there are always drivers and tuk-tuk operators to take you (tuk-tuks are very cheap, but the drivers are motivated by commission to take you to other places en route!) We found the buses on the main road just outside the hotel to be an interesting and exhilarating way of getting to places like Galle, Ambalangoda, Hikkaduwa or Balapitiya. I'm saving already to go back !",positive
"First and foremost, the Hertitance is a great hotel. You begin by turning into the gates, up the tree lined way and the first site of the Hotel, with the beach and the sea through the open reception is stunning. We were greeted by a personal staff member (I'm rubbish with names, even after promising myself to name them all) and welcome fresh fruit drinks, whilst we were checked in. First impressions met. We were taken to our room, we'd booked a suite as we needed the extra room for the two kids, and I have to say the room was lovely. Sure there were a couple of bits and pieces that could have and maybe should be rectified, e.g the somewhat tatty bathroom blind, the light fitting in our main bedroom and a couple of minor paint jobs, but overall it was great. A huge entrance hall, a big lounge, a huge and lovely bedroom and then a lovely bathroom. The bedroom and lounge had balcony access which provided superb sea views and of the immediate gardens - even the wild, huge monitor lizard that kept walking past in the morning. When we'd checked in, we were given the impression that they'd accommodate our two young girls in whatever way, whether it be dietary, baby sitting or otherwise and this wasn't wrong. The hotel has a number of different eateries, all of excellent standard. We were on a bed a breakfast package only, but this wasn't a problem, the pool side snacks or the 24 hr restaurant offered great food and service, and we were always asked whether the kids wanted anything special doing. Even the little touches like providing free fresh milk for the girls whenever we asked during the day. That said, with notice the chefs were also happy to make anything special that they could, especially traditional Sri Lankan. The main restaurant offers a buffet of different variety every night which we used once - the standard and range of different dishes impressive, but we then used the A la Carte places which again were nice. When we got there, there were a couple of large parties which gave the place more of a young persons resort, but when they'd checked out, the real place shone through, a real family place. The beach is nice, although with the usual Hawkers just on the beach passed the Hotel grounds, but they soon get the message being polite but firm - indeed we found it lovely in the morning and evening to walk down with the girls. The pool is great, very relaxing, with sun beds also around the grounds. There is a 2nd pool, the residents pool, which seemed much quieter but we never went in there. Loads of crabs running round the place - a couple even in the pool which was unique! One of the Hotel 'Animation' team did water aerobics a couple of days, all free, and very well attended. The hotel also offered kids activities to order should we have needed them. Entertainment was by the pool bar in an evening but we never stayed long enough with the children to really see it. We took one day trip down to Galle that we'd pre-arranged and it was about an hour away - no fuss and an easy drive down. Getting to the hotel was a little bit longer given the roads in Sri Lanka but it was overall worth the wait. We didn't want or need to leave the Hotel apart from that. My wife used the Spa one day and said it was great, maybe a little expensive but the treatment was lovely as were the ladies in there. But it was also quiet. The downsides. Apart from the aforementioned tidying up of the general room decor, there's very limited buggy/ pushchair access to the higher floors (we were on 3 of 3), but there was only one lift and the day that was out of order, I was carrying the buggy up the stairs until we were told about the service lift. The sun loungers by the pool need modernising - too many of them were broken or needed a bit of repair, but that's really it. Nothing to worry about. The Heritance certainly isn't a 5* hotel, but that said, we never had any of the problems or bad experiences as some people have commented. The hotel has all the right things in place - the position, the hotel buildings, the views and most of all the staff who I couldn't praise enough. The Heritance can be whatever it wants to become - addressing a few small issues like a paint, replacement off sun loungers would make it a truly great place. Would we go back, yes without a doubt.",positive
we booked a room for 2 nights & checked out after staying only for one. Room & toilet were not clean to a 5 star standard. The sofa & furniture in the room were old & worn out. Food was just baisc stuff. The pools are big & excellent. A average hotel.,neutral
"If there can be more water sports available will be nice.Staffs are so kindly to solve our requirements. Environmentally-friendly hotel with groups of monkeys and cranes. Beds in standard room are a little high for me and my mom. The price of the gem store is quite unreasonable and much more higher than shops in Colombo, do not buy anything.",neutral
"We visited Heritance Ahungalla in December 2013 during our summer vacation. This was a memorable experience for us. The location was beautiful. The beach was breathtakingly wonderful. The hotel is ideally located. The rooms were large and beautifully appointed with comfortable beds and the bathroom was a luxury. We have stayed at other Heritance hotels and this was no exception, The service was second to none. The staff were always ready to please. We loved the choice of food too. The choice was vast and the taste was superb. The chef went out of the way to prepare us extra dishes to please us. We would certainly recommend this hotel.",positive
"We have been to this place number of times including our honey moon, every time we got a very good service Pros: nice hotel architecture, big pool, food with plenty of varieties child friendly Cons: Small rooms Small restaurant compared to kandalama",positive
"Absolutely no choice of food for a vegitarians. Even after the Manager and the Chef were appraised, having promised vegitarian food, they gave only two eggless hoppers after a wait of 20 minutes. Chef Dinesh gave an excuse saying that he had to manage the hotel with two chefs as others have gone for a competition. There is a massive choice for non vegitarians. They dont seem to care us as we are locals. I would not recommend this place as they dont have any regard for locals and especially for locals. We are waiting to get out of the hotel as it ruined our holiday and wasted our money.",negative
"a truley reccomendable hotel, rooms are spacious and extreamly clean, the bathrooms are fully equiped, 2 swimming pools, clean and beautiful , peaceful and lovely beach. management and staff excellent, the buffet is outstanding, you get a grand variety of sri lankan and oriental cuisine, wonderful experience.",positive
"First the good bits: pool and beach here are gorgeous. Staff are all excellent and try very hard. That's it for the good bits This hotel is on desperate need of an upgrade to claim its 5 star rating. 5 star this is not. Tired rooms, leaking shower, bath that did not drain , mouldy screens etc. Lobby bathrooms - 2 out if 3 cubicles no lighting, doors did not lick and paint chipping off the doors. The food here is ok. If you are looking for a good 3.5 star hotel then this is fine but we have stayed in many other so called luxury hotels on this trip and they were all way above this hotel in terms of fit out and upkeep . They do many things really well here but 5 star lodgings it is not.",negative
"Beautiful Geoffrey Bawa designed hotel in a lovely quiet location. The staff are incredibly kind, generous and attentive. The food is fabulous and we were treated to a cookery demonstration by the chefs and a tour of the kitchens. Just a fabulous place to relax and reasonably priced too. 2 massive pools. I would highly recommend a stay here. River safari trip was I think the best value for money excursion, a really great day.",positive
"Had 1.5 days at this wonderful hotel. Great facilities, great staff, and great ambiance. A fantastic place to relax and unwind. The breakfast in the garden was fabulous and an early walk on the beach is a must. Be patient with some of the new staff, for their English may be a bit weak, but their hearts are definitely in the right place. The management did everything they could to accomodate us. Our only problem was that we didn't get to stay longer!!! Definitely a place to go to unwind!",positive
"The Heritance Ahungalla staff must be complimented for the outstanding service! The Premier rooms we occupied on Level 3 were spacious and comfortable. The Luxury Room # 333 which Farina and I occupied was unusually large, with a very spacious living room and large balcony. We spent an enjoyable 3 days at the hotel. The pool for resident guests was quiet and had privacy. The beach was clean and broad and the sea...warm and inviting!",positive
"Spent 3 days chilling out on the beautiful beach at this lovely resort. Rooms are gorgeous, spacious and tastefully decorated. Housekeeping is very good and nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast service / dinner service in the buffet restaurant is great - extensive spread with very friendly staff - even the chefs were engaging and remembered our preferences during the stay. The 24 hour restaurant menu was ok - the staff were a bit grumpy on the 2 occasions we dined there. Not by any means bad - just paled in comparison to the excellent service in the buffet restaurant.The food in this restaurant is good - some more casual options would be great - i.e. pizzas, burgers, toasted sandwiches etc. Two nice swimming pools to explore ( the green pool had a better atmosphere). Spa is well done - very professional treatments and city prices.",positive
"Great place to end our Holiday. Quality room, immaculate beach,outstanding service. F&B slightly expensive due to the taxes. However the buffet and breakfast spread were fantastic. Great work with chefs cooking hoppers and dosai. Particularly would like to thank the all day dining staff and manager who were fantastic. Special mention - Kumarasiri Salinda who was outstanding with all guests. He remembered names and what our son liked. The front office and porters are equally to be applauded. Great work and will see you next year. Would suggest fellow travelers to stay away from the beach hawkers.",positive
"We did a one night stay at Heritance when we were down in SL for a vacation. The delux room we got was spacious with a comfortable king-sized bed and a balcony with a sea view. The food was amazing (we did full-board) with a good selection. Nice infinity pools. Most of all, the service provided was excellent by the friendly, very attentive staff. They were thoughtful enough to help us with our toddler while me and my husband dined. Overall we had a lovely stay and would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a peaceful family holiday.",positive
"What an exceptional hotel. Glorious location on a stunning golden sand beach, beautiful garden teaming with birds, monkeys, iguanas and a fabulous staff who go out of their way to be helpful and friendly. Thanks to General Manager Refhan N. Razeen for his great hospitality and kindness and for his amazing eco-friendly policy of sustainable, environmentally friendly hotel management. Also thanks to Kumara Karunaratne for managing a superb buffet restaurant with a staggering choice of delicious foods. No wonder Heritance Ahungalla won Beach Resort of the Year Award. Altogether a great holiday location.",positive
"Very good hotel. Nice location ( in the middle of asian small village), lovely long deserted beach - exellent for those who like privacy and calm atmosphere. very good food!!! Thank you for giving us room 132 with the direct access to the swimming pool! Nice service. We liked almost everything, except for the shortage of sunbeds and Sun umbrellas ( even thoug we were in low sezon). It is not the thing you should worry about in this kind of hotel....Also some parts of rooms/ bathrooms nide some renovation.",positive
"During our tour of Sri Lanka, we stayed 4 nights at this hotel. For us a very good experience and one of the best of our 23 day trip The rooms are spacious and kept clean. The food in the restaurants is very good quality and also the buffet well warm.en tasteful. Attentive and service oriented staff, who do everything to make your stay verry well. The only thing we didn't like that there were too less beach chairs provided and many were in poor condition. For the rest, this hotel is highly recommended. Sincerely, Ben and Leone Brouwers The Netherlands",positive
"Four of us in the family chose Heritance, Ahungalla for. one day stay and it was fascinating. Booked through the hotel web site. Check in was cool, slight delay, as the hotel was on full occupancy and we were upgraded into a luxury suite and a deluxe Room. That was great and overall nice please to stay. Staff were very attentive, food was varied and suit most pallets. Good pool especially one reserved for residents was clean and nice with a good pool attendant. Will recommend any one to spend the holiday at this nice property.",positive
"My husband and I stayed here for the second week of our honeymoon in Sri Lanka at the beginning of March. We had our room upgraded as we were on our honeymoon which was amazing as it had a huge balcony looking strait onto the beach and out to sea. All the food we had at the hotel was very good. We found the breakfast selection good and the freshly made hoppers fantastic mmm! The 'cafe' restaurant next to the pool was good value and the food was all high standard. All of the staff were friendly and helpful and the pools are great. There is not a lot around the hotel (other than the fantastic stretch of sandy beach and the sea) but you can easily get a tuk tuk or taxi to Bentota or we went to Galle for the day which was lovely. We also visited Kosgoda Turtle conservation hatchery, very cute! I would definitely recommend this hotel, especially if you have done your exploring of the country and want to relax in an amazing setting!",positive
all though the hotel and people were very good we found that being only bed and breakfast we liked to go out to different restaurants in the evening which was a 20 minute ride away as there was not really anything closer.We felt that on the beach you were never left alone and if you went out of the complex you ran the gauntlet of the locals,neutral
"Been here with my wife and had the most relaxing time on one of the most beautiful beaches in Sri Lanka. - Great food quality at the buffet but I can really recommend the a la carte restaurant next to the pool bar, we had amazing lobster and other dishes there - The beach is tidy with nice sand and the sea is really warm and great to swim in Service is outstanding - ask for Mr. Thushara he helped us with everything!",positive
"Stayed in August 2013 for Business Meet.The location of the hotel is superb with a lovely view of the sea. The rooms appear to be old need renovation, the rooms don't have card key. the meals were not suiting the tastes for Indian Palate. The staff is not attentive at all, language problem I suppose always had to be called many times even for water. Overall was an average experience.",neutral
"We have just spent a very enjoyable 17 nights at Heritance Ahungalla which is set on a fanastic stretch of beach. On arrival the view through the reception area is breathtaking with the infinity pool stretching out towards the ocean. Our welcome was very friendly and check-in was quick, which is just what you want after a long tiring journey. As you go about the hotel and are greeted by members of staff you very soon realise what an amazingly friendly hotel this is, where the staff are happy to help you in any way they can. The Guest Relations team were always happy to chat and a great help as were the front desk staff particularly Manjula. Having a pre-dinner drink by the pool, with the sound of the waves crashing was one of those perfect moments, especially if Madhu served us - it wasn't quite so perfect if it was her day off !!! The standard of the food was excellent and so much choice, plus the desserts were to die for !!. Staff in the Jute restaurant were all very helpful and efficient particularly Nelka-priyan, Lakmal, Anouska, Lassiter and Charuka. We stayed in a suite (an up-grade) which was very spacious and comforable with a wonderful view and very quiet air conditioning. Housekeeping were very attentive with extra touches : flowers and towels arranged as swans on our very comfortable bed. This was our 4th time in Sri Lanka and Heritance Ahungalla is by far the best hotel we've stayed in.....we will be back.",positive
"This was our first trip to Sri Lanka and we chose the Heritance Ahungalla after reading the excellent reviews on TripAdvisor. We were not disappointed, arriving at the hotel, driving through the entrance gates, being met by welcoming staff and the stunning vista across the infinity pool, we could feel the 'stress' just melting away. The beach , stretching for miles, is stunning with large breaking waves, fun to play in but for swimming the pool is a safer option. Staff could not be more helpful and always had a friendly smile, pool staff tried to ensure your sunbed was in the area you wanted to relax, rooms were kept meticulously clean, the view from 217, gorgeous, and the food superb! We booked on half board and enjoyed the buffet meal each night, there was a wide variety on offer, beautifully presented and delicious, often hotel food looks good but actually, on tasting, is a little disappointing however at the Heritance we found the flavour matched the appearance. Congratulations to all the catering team! If guests do not book half board there is an excellent small beach restaurant, think it was called sunshine? sunview? We could not mention the Heritance food without a special mention of Tinkle, one of the chef's, his food was delicious and we thoroughly enjoyed his special attention and dishes he specifically prepared for us. If booking trips through Aitken Spence ask for tour guide Roshain D'Silva, he is knowledgable, always ensured we got the very best out of the trip. and became a friend during our stay. If you would prefer a short trip by tuk tuk, then seek out Susantha at the hotel gates, he is a lovely fellow and excellent driver! Would we return? Most definitely, we can't wait! The owners of Heritance Ahungalle should be proud of their hotel and very professional staff team .",positive
"i love sri lanka but i'm not coming back to this hotel. we got bad service in the reception, with the cashier, at the pool bar, at the fine dining restaurant and the buffet restaurant ... we stayed there for three days and in the end we were pleased indeed to leave. we experienced that the staff was highly incompetent and at times rude. they also had no track of bills and there were a long wait at all, even the purchase of a single Soda! the exception was the friendly helpful people at the pool and housekeeping. they did a really good job.",negative
My four girl friends and i had a wonderful two day stay at Heritance Ahungalla. Service was excellent from the very start. Waiters went out of the way to attend to our every need. The hotel has an award winning chef (Chef Demutthu) and we were privileged to have a tour of the kitchen and see some of his award winning works. loved every minute there and was so reluctant to leave,positive
"We stayed 5 nights as an add-on to our two week island tour when the hotel was busy mainly with German, Russian and Ukrainian guests many of who were in large groups and are on all inclusive packages. Its is a quiet location on a beautiful beach with no other hotels nearby. Whilst we were there the sea was quite rough with a strong undercurrent. There is a well designed and maintained infinity pool, just off the lobby, that blends in with the sea giving the impression that you are actually in the sea. There is also another large pool elsewhere in the grounds. We were disappointed with the deluxe room that we were offered and so paid considerably more (although discounted) for a luxury suite upgrade which was very nice though was somewhat more than we needed though nothing else appeared to be available. The main restaurant (Jute) serves an excellent buffet as it offers a large choice of good quality international food though with probably less Asian dishes than we had at other hotels elsewhere. The groups sit at large tables in middle of this restaurant and can be quite noisy at dinner times. Our room hotel guide stated that attire for dinner was ‘smart casual’ though this was largely ignored by many guests and especially by some men who wore jeans, shorts, T shirts and football shirts. Beach fine dining was excellent with a good choice of dishes from an a la carte menu including some wonderful seafood. Attentive and friendly service made this a truly memorable occasion. There was a lack of sun beds and umbrellas around the pools and grounds. Also, the sun beds and towels were old and many of the beds were broken or had wheels missing so there was the daily early morning rush to get towels on good beds with umbrellas. The hotel needs to invest money in buying new furniture and towels to ensure there are enough for all guests. Lunchtime food at the pool bar was limited to burgers, sandwiches and half a dozen other snacks which really should be supplemented by some salads and some more Asian snacks. Service in the grounds Service away from the two pools was infrequent and we usually had to walk to the bar to buy drinks. We have discussed our views with a representative of the hotels management (Dinusha Kularatne) who says he will be writing a report detailing our comments. It's a good hotel but it didn't live up to our expectations of the luxury hotel we wanted at the end of our holiday.",neutral
"We recently returned from a two week vacation in Sri Lanka. The first half was very active.. touring the cultural triangle, the tea estates and sites in between. While wonderful, that part of the trip was tiring. We had planned to then relax at Ahungalla for several days. Our stay at the Heritance Ahungalla was the perfect balance to the hustle of the prior week. The accomodations were exquisite. The Bawa designed building was beautiful, with classic elements of Sri Lanakan architecture as well as the trademark blending of structure with nature. The food was exquisite, especially the Sri Lankan fare. The spa is fantastic (my wife said ""the best massage of my life""). The staff was incredibly gracious, welcoming and thoughtful. Our children were especially delighted by the daily towel sculptures in the room. And, Ahungalla was a good base for smaller excursions to Galle, Madhu Ganga river safari and other smaller destinations. This was one of our favorite hotels on the trip (even though we stayed in several other Aitken Spence hotels the prior week). We would definitely come back here on a future trip.",positive
"We have been to many hotels on Sri Lanka but Heritance Ahungalla has the best employees. Everyone is kind and smilig an do their best. We want to stay there because of this, and their good food, because of good chefs. Our treenaigers want to stay because of the animaitors, so everyone enjoying. This trip we stad at six fivestar hotels everyone good but Ahungalla best.",positive
Leading architect Mr.Jeffry Bava's design concept hotel. the hotel is a ideal place for those who love tranquility. And there is no much activities for those looks for active vacation. Award winning culinary art chefs food is one of the attractions for the most guests.,positive
Second time @ Heritance Ahungalla. The hotel is luxurious en the staff correct en very considerate. The rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable. The restaurant has a large variety of the finest fresh food. The kitchen has been awarded with the gold medal for New Sri Lankan Cuisine in the Culinary Arts 2011 competition organised by the Chefs Guild of Sri Lanka. The beach-attendants give you the feeling you are a VIP. The undertoe in the sea was strong and we had a red flag all week. I guess this was exceptional for this time of year. We will surely return to this hotel.,positive
"It was only because of the hotels staff that my 2 nights stay here from being a horrible one to a very good experience. We checked in very late one evening and were given rooms above the coffee shop grill which meant that the rooms were full of the grill seafood smoke. A few minutes inside the rooms we started feeling like grilled fish ourselves. Upon request for room change we were told that the hotel was full and our request thus denied. Dinner at the coffee shop was a pretty sad affair too. The chicken that we were served was so hard that I am sure if I'd thrown it at a passerby that person would get hurt. After a stroll on the beach when we came to our rooms past midnight we realized that there was no water supply in the rooms due to some maintenance work and that it'd be restored around 2 am. That too did not happen. Our arms full of woes we met the Resident Manager Sampath De Silva and were surprised that he offered no arguments but only an apology. From that point onwards our stay turned into heaven. Mr Sampath offered to change our rooms and the staff went out of their way to be helpful, courteous and friendly. I'd particularly like to mention manager Praveen from the restaurants who made sure that the fare that was served to us was excellent. I'd recommend that future travellers take advantage of an exclusive special table d' hote that they arrange on the beach. The experience is put of the world.",negative
"Housekeeping was helpful, he tried very hard to please us and cleaned twice a day. Showers need a good clean up especially the tiles which had black spots. Dining room: Large variety of foods for curry and spicy food lovers, great deserts.",neutral
"My wife and I have just spent 10 nights here half board Feb 2014. This was our first holiday in Sri Lanka and all being well we shall be returning before too long. Having read other guest reviews before booking The Heritance it was pleasing that the standards were as described in the more favourable descriptions. The staff with very few exceptions were all obliging and friendly and the service they gave was by and large very good. Our room with sea view was just to the side of, and overlooking the swimming pool on the top (third) floor. A nice room and location apart from odd occasions when music from the hotel beach party became very loud, although it has to be said not too late at night. The guests were truly a global mix but a small minority (not connected with the Corporate bash) encamped by the pool frequently chose to disregard the ""no diving"" sign or maybe could not read English! So best sit in the bar area not too close to the water to avoid being splashed. Dining is buffet style and the standard and variety of dishes on offer was good. However, in our opinion standards slipped a notch over the 2-3 days the hotel catered for 250-300 attendees of a major European corporate function. We usually ate dinner around 8.00pm but to make sure of not being disappointed I think it is probably advisable to be there early doors as a few dishes were not kept replenished frequently enough. Drinks and food prices are reasonable (perhaps with the exception of wines) but the guest is not given a copy of each bill. Therefore in our experience it proved prudent to ask the hotel for an updated statement of account every couple of days as mistakes did happen no matter how unintentional. As for the locals selling their wares on the beach we found them to be real characters who love the banter. OK they are a bit persistent but the stuff is the same as in the nearest town and prices are the same after a good bit of bartering. No tuk tuk ride away either. On the subject of tips to the room cleaners, porters, etc.100 rupees (50p) to show appreciation is a small amount (all hotel bills have tax and gratuities added automatically so no need to tip extra if you don't want) and after seeing a sign in Colombo offering breakfast AND dinner for 100 rupees it brought it home to us just how fortunate we are.",positive
"Ceylan (Sri Lanka) is astonishing! Unfortunately this seaside hotel was the worse in our journey around Sri Lanka. Even if it's classified 5 stars, on reality it is not. The hotel needs a huge renovation ( a must for the 80's superb architecture from very well known Sri Lanka architect), the cleanliness could be much better and the staff (almost all of them very friendly) should have better management and be more professional. Even though ( even next time going visit Ceylan is better booking and hotel north of Colombo, because is near the cultural and forest tours), the stay was relaxing and, for a change at the far east beaches, there were 26º C 3 meter waves to brake....",neutral
"We stayed here for 3 nights at the end of our tour of Sri Lanka for a bit of R&R by the pool. The design of the hotel is fantastic designed around the landscape with trees and pools around every corner. The swimming pools and garden areas were great including the local lizards and chipmunks providing poolside entertainment. The food was great in the restaurants we tried. As it was valentines day we had a special dinner on the beach and the food was fantastic, as was the spectacularly cheesy entertainment, it hard to stop laughing at some points but it just added to the experience. My wife had a massage in the spa and assured me it was very good and the price was reasonable for a resort hotel like this. Now for a few minor gripes I have. Firstly the rooms could just do with a little TLC to bring them up to the standard I would expect (a couple of light switches did not work, a little paintwork peeling etc.) Secondly while many of the staff were excellent there were a couple who let the side down, some of the staff seemed intent on giving you the bill for drinks and soon as you put down an empty glass rather than offering more drinks, it just seemed like they did not trust you to sign the bill and wanted to get you before you ran away. Also the prices did not include service charge or government tax which meant 20% was added on top of everything, why not just include this in the price? All in all we had a very enjoyable stay they could just improve a couple of things ot make it even better.",positive
"Just returned from an 11 night stay at Heritance Ahungalla and already making plans to return. Check in was fast and faultless. The room was well appointed, spotless and, considering the amount of guests, quiet too. Efficiently cleaned daily (even the balcony), tea/coffee replaced, evening turn down service, couldn't fault it. Having spent a month travelling,in Sri Lanka, this was by far the best hotel of my trip. Breakfast buffet was something to look forward too with a superb and varied choice. The evening meals had a different theme with a massive array of western and asian dishes, all cooked and presented at a high standard. After a longish stay at a hotel, buffet meals can sometimes become a bit tedious with a longing to eat elsewhere, but despite several beach cafe choices, we were never tempted away from the quality food served at the hotel. Getting tea and coffee could require a bit of patience in the mornings but this is not logged as a complaint just a niggle when you need your early morning caffiene fix. The pools are amongst the best I saw in Sri Lanka, cleaned daily, the grounds kept neat and tidy and the beach vendors kept at bay by security and a respected boundry line although they do become a complete nusiance shouting and calling out to try and sell their goods but after a couple of days they tend to get the hang of who is worth pursuing and who needs to keep having sales tactics applied to. Beach is a beautiful mile plus of fine sand backed by palm trees and suprisingly free of plastic debris; not totally free but judged against standards of some asian beaches and the collection of bags etc that gets washed up, it's a gem. Only problem is that a walk along this beach is punctuated by the attention of several 'best friends' you never knew you had that want to get you to a cafe/gem shop/ tour but a firm 'no thanks' seems to be respected. There is a handy wine shop to the right of the hotel and several little shops that sell most stuff you could need but don't let any of the men that pounce on you the moment you walk through the gate follow you or continue any sort of converstion as they will be clocking a commission at your expense for taking you to the shop. They get the plan and politely telling them to stop, stay here and don't follow me is respected and didn't cause offence. Would I return to this hotel, too right I will. Would I recommend it, absolutely without hesitation!",negative
"This is a lovely hotel in many ways but it isn't quite good enough to get a ""very good"". It seemed very expensive for what one got but that may be because we booked a suite directly with the hotel. I suspect many of the hotel guests had booked via tour operators and got a considerably better deal than we got. We were shocked by the average age of the guests which must have been 60+. Don't come here expecting a wild or exciting time! The setting is lovely and the beach is good. The waves are wonderful to play in but they are very strong and only for confident swimmers. The food was of a high quality and reasonably priced although breakfast was a little disappointing. Staff were well meaning but often inept. I once asked for bread 5 times before we got any. We could see the bread baskets in the restaurant ready to be given to diners but the waiters just didn't seem able to serve us (there was only one other table dining in the restaurant so the waiters were not rushed off their feet). We also asked for the bill only to be ignored for 15 minutes (despite being the only people in the restaurant by then). When we asked again, we were met with a blank look and a lack of comprehension. In the end, we said we were going to our room and asked if they could send the bill to us there? The bill never arrived although we were charged for the meal so someone managed to sort things out. At breakfast, we wanted to sit outside as the restaurant was very gloomy. There was only one umbrella between about 20 tables so we would sit in the shade which sometimes necessitated moving the table a little or turning it so we weren't in the sun. Quite often, the staff would then move the table back whilst we were serving ourselves at the buffet. We would then move it again. Also, I asked the chef making omelettes if I could have poached eggs and he had no idea what they were. Fortunately, another chef did and went and organised them for me in the kitchen (they were cooked perfectly). Having said all of that, the staff were lovely and wanted to please. The Valentine's dinner was great. It had the perfect level of cheesy entertainment (the dancers were hamming it up brilliantly), the food was very good and the staff couldn't do enough to please. The beds are very uncomfortable so do consider that if bed comfort is important to you. It was like sleeping on wooden boards. We had a good holiday here but it really wasn't worth what we paid.",neutral
"Heritance Ahungalla is a beautiful hotel, pools excellent especially the one with the infinity design! Staff could not be more helpful, rooms were a bit tired but the laundry/towels changed daily and room cleaned. Hotel is on a beautiful beach which is almost always empty, except for the rather troublesome vendors, you have to be firm and eventually they go away. Not much choice of places to eat out if you don't eat at the hotel, we found one restaurant called Sunshine, really nice, but other than that it is a tuk tuk ride into a nearby town, about half an hour or so, this was a bit annoying as we were not full board. I would recommend this hotel if you wish to be full board, otherwise it would be worth going to another area.",positive
"Our 1st visit to Sri Lanka won't be our last thanks to our stay at Heritance. I'm repeating what others have said before me but the staff at all levels were wonderful, friendly, well spoken and nothing was ever too much trouble. Our room, pools and restaurant were immaculate. Sri Lanka is a beautiful country and we did some wonderful trips booked though our rep Mercury Direct. We also hired bikes from the hotel one morning and followed a route (ask at reception for map)that took us past temples,paddy fields and a couple of villages, this was an amazing experience, but be aware when you first step outside the hotel gates you will be bombarded by eager tuk tuk drivers and shop owners all wanting your attention. I can't really complain about the people selling things on the beach as I did buy from them, but I feel they are a little bit intrusive, they're not allowed in the grounds so call to you from the beach. I just can't wait to return to Ahungalla and wish I was there now. Whooops nearly forgot to mention the food was exceptional, the best hotel meals we ever had, its certainly ideal for curry lovers and vegetarians",positive
"We are about to leave the hotel after a fantastic week at the beach. A little hiccup at check in where we booked 2 adjoining rooms, as we have two young boys and were told connecting rooms were not available. However we got a great suite with spacious balcony that made up for it. Staff is smiley and corteous, and service is of high standard, though sometimes a bit slow. Overall the beach is excellent, despite the red flag my five year old really enjoyed the waves. The pool is also excellent and really relaxing. The spa is of good quality as well. Sugar one of the staff is particularly talented. A trip to Kandy is well worth it, despite terrible traffic. Temples, local culture centre and elephant orphanage have made an unforgettable experience.A great family experience, sand, see and great service. We hope to be back!",positive
"This was a great holiday experience in a great hotel. The hotel itself was superb as was our room. It's in a lovely location with excellent facilities, giving us everything we wanted from our holiday. The two pools are great to lounge around and set in attractive grounds with lots of natural shade to enjoy. It's also easy to access the beautiful beach. The staff were all exceptional. Polite, friendly and helpful, they were always ready to engage in conversation and take an interest in how we were. The food here is of a very high standard. A mix of traditional Sri Lankan and western and always fresh, varied and plentiful. The range of curries were superb. Wine is expensive but good quality Lion lager and delicious EGB (elephant ginger beer) makes up for it. The cocktails are great too! Possibly the one downside was the attention from the beach vendors. The vendors selling saris, tunics and throws were ok and were nice to talk with. But some of those selling trips and promoting their restaurants were very annoying. Persistently following you when walking on the beach. But you soon learn to deal with them. Overall this was an amazing holiday in what is an amazing country.",positive
"This hotel is a joyous masterpiece of design and makes full use of the flora by blurring the distinction between outdoors and indoors. All corridors and most public spaces are open to the outside. The gardens are extremely spacious and sun bed and umbrellas can be placed to give a maximum amount of privacy - there is certainly no fighting for sun beds round the pool! To keep you company in the gardens are water monitors and chipmunks. The staff are all unfailingly cheerful and friendly and always willing to engage in conversation. On one occasion the Sous Chef, Roshan stopped for a conversation in the dining room and when we asked about the kitchen he invited us to look round. The hotel is very proud of its culinary accomplishments, winning prizes at international competitions and the quality of the food certainly reflects this. The value of the pound against the SR Rupee makes this a reasonably priced holiday, and even the prices at a hotel of this standard are reasonable (except the wine list). Galle is in easy reach by car. We hired a car with driver and guide for 8000 Rupees and apart from simply going to Galle our guide, Pippi, also stopped at a mask museum, the tsunami memorial and a moonstone mine, none of which we asked for but which enhanced the trip. The journey itself is of interest and highlights the devastation of the 2004 tsunami and the efforts made to repair the damage. An unforgettable holiday and well worth going, the only downside being the length of the flights!",positive
Hotel itself was very nice but our room smelled of mould at times. Also the service staff when they knew we were in our room had a habit of knocking on the door so many times it became obvious that in fact all they were after was a tip. I appreciate there is poverty in the country but this was the on thing which spoiled our stay. The meals in the restaurant were excellent each time. I would highly recommend staying here if you do not mind being 'tapped' for tips.,neutral
We have been in this hotel more than 10 times and our next stay is already booked. Our feeling is like to come back to our second home. Managment and staff is very friendly and helpful. If you like to relax it's the perfect place to stay.,positive
The most accommodating staff I've met. One of our favorite hotels in terms of atmosphere & we absolutely love the pool with the tree by the side of it. The food is great & the prices are very reasonable indeed. A must visit for anyone really!,positive

"I have just returned from a one week stay at this hotel. The day of my arrival was Independence Day and therefore preparation for celebrations were in full swing, funnily I immediately felt part of the hotel. The staff were lovely, helpful, calm and polite even when I was a bit fraught with things not exactly working out as planned from my travel company. Lazy days on the beach were marred by enthusiastic beach vendors, however with the help of a German guest I managed to negotiate a good price for a silk scarf having told myself ""I am most certainly not going to buy anything from them!"" Sri Lankans are welcoming people and not all are after your money, although I did find the tipping to the hotel staff obligatory which got embarrassing, if not down right annoying one guy round the pool seemed to want tipping to speak to me! Yet another saved my sunbed all morning for only a smile. On my last morning my pick up time was some unearthly early morning hour, but the kitchen staff managed to lay on my own personal buffet breakfast AND I received a breakfast picnic to take with me to the airport. Food was mediocre but good a selection at breakfast, dinner with my half board was a bit ""breakfast warmed up"" with some dishes, although as a vegetarian my tastes were well catered for plus an offer of my personal selection from the chef. A Fawlty moment one evening when I asked for a black coffee to complete the meal. I was told ""Coffee off, no more coffee, sorry coffee is finished"" err is this a hotel? this was rectified when a member of the waiting staff later turned up with my coffee. It needs more polish. Little things like a stain on the table cloth, cloudy glasses, no hair conditioner, a chip on the bathroom mug,a stain on the net curtains in my room and the corridor to the room looked more ""seaside guest house"". They were improving the walls on the stairs of the hotel with stencilling. A warning, I hit my head on a metal plank balanced precariously between the bannisters where the ""artist"" stood. Health and Safety in the UK would have closed it down. I did mention it and the reception staff thanked me for drawing it to their attention. The plank remained. The hotel was over all quiet and the music went on till only 10.30pm I did like an early night but the music was pleasant enough despite hearing it in my room and as I say it was only to 10.30pm. The hotel did seem to regulate conferences/weddings to noise minimum and respect to their guests. It might pass for a 4 star only Sri Lankan style but it was not 5 star. Too many rude Russians but this is not a hotel issue just a way of life on holiday now.",negative
"We stayed hear from the 26th of January for 10 nights I have to say the staff could not do more to please you. check in was smooth and simple, we stayed on an all-inclusive basis and for some reason initially we had to pay for a glass of wine at the pool Barr as my wife likes to drink spritzers however one of the Barr chaps noticed this and spoke to the management who change this policy for my wife. On the second day we were joined by around 150 French people at the hotel and that evening we were stopped by a member of staff who asked if everything was alright because of the added guest which to me was showing care for the other guest. The first thing I think other travellers need to consider is the amount of people who pass through these hotels and the amount of abuse they sustain, however I think I saw a man with a paint brush everyday touching up the paint work and there was always a maintenance man doing something. On one occasion the manger asked if we had any problems and I commented that the light in the wardrobe didn’t work and on returning from a tour the next day it did. One evening when browsing the sweet selection a member of staffed asked if there was anything he could do and I said I fancy chees and biscuits 5 minutes later I had chees and biscuits. The staff just could not do enough for you and I would like to thank Refhan and his staff for all the hard work they put in, ask to see the chocolate factory amazing. There were beach touts but the were OK not to pushy and left you alone if you said no, we used our tour companies excursions which meant we had a mini bus to ourselves with a good guide but to get to the cultural triangle is a bit of a drive but interesting.",positive
"Stayed here recently during tour. Great resort type complex on beach, great pool. Pity so far from Galle and all the attractions . Nothing interesting outside the hotel , can feel "" trapped"". Had most amazing chicken dish in casual restaurant . Friendly attentive staff. Lots of European tourists soaking up sun and resort facilities.",positive
This is a peaceful and beautiful hotel. Before setting off from England the hotel was very helpful in arranging a taxi to pick us up from the hotel. We had a very lovely driver called ***Sampath*** (so please ask for him as he is helpful and became our driver for the duration of the trip. He also took us to get a VERY VERY good interest rate) he also lives at the hotel. TIP- PAY IN USD for the taxi TIP-HOTEL ACCEPTS RUPEES ONLY We stayed for six nights and felt very safe being to young girls. The facilities are great how ever do choose the residence pool is by far the most relaxing. Only two negatives the hotel food can be very repetitive there was a lot of fish varieties and and not much chicken choices. A couple of nights we paid to eat at there a la carte restaurant where the food was 1000%%% better and could really indulge. Be prepared for the long 2.5-3 hour transfer (please don't be put off) it is worth every minute on arrival. You are automatically swept off your feet by the wonderful staff and stunning view through the reception over the infinity pool and face the wonderful ocean. TIP - If you want to avoid the transfer time on the way back you are able to talk to the hotel about staying in Colombo before the flight to break up the journey we used our last two nights free of charge to stay in Colombo H/B and it really did finish off our stay in a relaxing way. TIP FOR THE HOTEL- The rooms would be more pleasant if the bathrooms were ungraded they do not look finished.,positive
"The hotel is a bit old and I would not rate it as 5 star hotel. I stayed there for 3 nights last FEB in a 2 interconnected rooms, the view was nice but the rooms were poor and give you the feeling of the 80s starting from the metal key to the furniture, the AC, the toilets…etc. I had all the meals in-room dining and it was by all means disaster, not clean at all (hair in the food, dirty plats, wrong orders) I made a complaint and the reaction of the restaurant manager was excellent and honestly he was professional gentleman…thank you Mr.KK.",negative
"We stayed here for a week on 8-15 jan 2014. The hotel is lovely, the staff are friendly and the food is good. There is plenty of choice and the fine dining restaurant was amazing and so cheap!! We went on a few trips, charlie our guide was so informative, he is insightful he has so much time for you nothing is too much trouble, we enjoyed his company so much that we requested he take us on our second trip on another day. He told us all about Sri Lanka he stopped at very photo opportunity. He picked us up at 420am one morning and didn't drop us off until 715pm we had an absolutely fantastic day and the whole time he was smiling away and pointing out all of the major sites etc. truly enjoyable and so nice to have someone who takes their time to explain everything to you. In two days we saw the pinwalla elephant orphanage a tea factory the bentota river cruise, whale watching, an elephant ride, we saw blue whale and dolphins, galle and the cricket ground, the turtle hatchery and much more truly enjoyable and the weather was gorgeous. It is a long way to travel to all of the trips but well worth it as there is so much to see. It is a lush country with so much produce and the people are genuinely so friendly; a truly magnificent place.",positive
"We stayed at this hotel at the end of 10 days touring the beautiful island if Sri Lanka. Our first impression was of the lovely setting the hotel was built on. Even though we were a bit daunted by the size of the hotel, once we had found our feet we liked it. The planning of the building has resulted in there being a quiet relaxing atmosphere. Our first room was not to our liking as it was at the junction of several corridors. However we asked to be relocated and found this room to be perfect. The staff in the restaurants were exceptional and on our first evening I enquired about gluten free bread which they provided.The following morning this was available and the manager of the restaurant said he would ask the kitchen chef to add more butter to make it softer. This is beyond my expectations. Each morning this was brought to me. I can honestly say that having dietary requirements can often be a challenge but this hotel certainly steps up to the mark . A big thank you to the catering staff. Hot water was plentiful and the house keeping of a high standard. This hotel gave us the opportunity to relax after a hectic tour . Our only suggestion would be to provide more umbrellas. We found that there were only about eight around the pool that we were sitting around and these were already spoken for very early in the morning.",positive
"We had booked this hotel some time ago, as part of a package with the parent company, Aiken Spence. The trip was paid for and confirmed. We arrived at around 1pm on the scheduled day, to be told the hotel was overbooked, and that we were to go to a smaller hotel 2km away. They apologised but offered no compensation. We had to demand to see the new hotel (we were told the room would be a suite, it wasn't). We had no call previously. The front desk people were very keen to move us along rather than ensure we were satisfied with the arrangements. Only after a displeased call to aitken spence were we offered recompense- half board at the hotel and a room upgrade, when we arrived there the next day. This practice of overbooking at hotels in Sri Lanka is not unheard of, but ought to be discouraged. Our advice would be to call the hotel to confirm yourself, and, if it happens, don't leave until you have spoken with the manager. This is a very shoddy way to treat paying guests. Apologies don't cut it, especially when over bookings are either deliberate or easily avoided,",negative
"The hotel complex was very spacious with a beautiful garden with trees and palm trees. By the open architecture was often a breeze, which given the hot temperatures very pleasant was. For the whole day looked the staff sweep and garden alright hold, i however not disturbing. The types of people were quite mixed, on german, english and french there was also in the, as well as guests from Sri Lanka, with their families only at the weekend were there. Guests in the 20. was virtually non-existent, the majority of the guests were approximately 40 years and older. In the entire property, there was free wireless internet, and the reception not everywhere was good. My room was in the area of peaceful pools and had direct sea view, it was a nice size, the bathroom with shower also. It was very nice furnished and had a balcony with a table and chairs. In bed i fantastically well slept. There was an easy to use safe (free of charge), as well as a minibar, tv , telephone, in bathroom with shower there was a hair dryer, as well as the usual shower gel, body lotion, bathrobe and slippers. The air conditioning was easy to regulate and hardly audible, there was also additionally a ceiling fan. The staff at reception and in the restaurants and bars was very friendly. With english you could communicate without a problem,. The cleaning of the rooms came 2 times a day and left this blumenbilder on the blanket, as well as always another animal out of towels folded. When a light bulb was broken, it was replaced immediately, although it was already in the evening after 22:00 o'clock was.",neutral

Thanks to all the staff.",positive
"It was a pleasant experience from the time we got off the vehicle to the time we got back in to leave. The welcome we received and the casual check-in process they adopt put you at ease immediately. From there onwards the room, restaurants and the common areas are very well designed and decorated. It was obvious that the staff were well trained as the service received from different staff members from different departments were the same and exceptional. The quality of food and the variety available at all meals made dinning a pleasure. They even handled our request for exceptional family rooming requirement and accommodated us. We will certainly be back soon!",positive
"We have just returned from a most wonderful stay at this hotel, and can recommend it in every way. The situation, right on a beautiful beach, and the architecture blends perfectly in to the environment and makes the most of the cooling breezes. It is conveniently placed for visits to near by Galle, and we especially enjoyed cycling through the lanes of local villages. What makes this hotel stand out, though , is the staff. Although we only stayed for a week, they made us feel like members of the family, and we were totally at home there. Every member of staff went out of their way to anticipate and meet our needs, and it is almost impossible to single out particular individuals who made our stay so special. KK, the restaurant manager and his assistant Anushka, ensured we had all we needed for every meal, and even arranged a delicious picnic for us to enjoy on our trip home. The food was absolutely delicious, catering for every taste, and Praveen Fernando found us a shady table outside for breakfast every morning. Mr de Silva, the general manager, was always on hand, and we felt cosseted and cherished throughout our stay. The swimming pools are amazing, and the shady garden a delight to relax in. The rooms are comfortable and spotless , again, with wonderful service. The local people of Sri Lanka , offering such warm and genuine a hospitality, are what makes a visit to this country so very special, this can be experienced in full at the Heritance Hotel. We had the most wonderful holiday , and will be recommending it to family and friends. We can't wait to return. Many thanks to all the members of staff who contributed to our delightful stay.",positive
"The service was exceptional in this hotel - hence I am starting off by mentioning this - everyone was so friendly and went out of their way to be welcoming. In fact this is the main reason we would return to this hotel. The rooms were fine - we stayed on the 3rd floor and they gave us a nice basket of fruit,biscuits and peanuts to welcome us. I thought dinner was average but nevertheless enjoyable; breakfast was lovely. It is more of a family hotel/ older couple hotel and I think the entertainment is geared to that audience. For the price this hotel is amazing. Another thing worth mentioning is this hotel seems to do a lot for its local community which I think is fantastic - there was an ad for a charity it supports in the lift. I also did wonder if the hotel endorsed the beach sellers - some people probably find the beach sellers a bit annoying but actually if you just tell them you are not interested they leave you alone. These people are just making a living and if I can help them by buying from them I am happy to do so.",positive
"After much debate of where to celebrate our 1st anniversary...my husband and I finally decided on Heritance Ahungalla and spent 3 nights there last December. In retrospect we both agree that we made the best decision! From the time we arrived we were treated to very personalized service that we were quite frankly not expecting from a hotel this size. In lieu of our anniversary we were upgraded to a luxury room - which was very spacious and had a fantastic bathroom - fully equipped with TWO wash basins, a bath tub and a fabulous rain shower!! This was a super start to our anniversary celebrations! On the actual day when we came down for dinner we were thrilled to find a specially decorated table for us and we were treated to a cake for dessert as well. This gesture from the Heritance team made us feel very special and truly added to make our day even better! We were on half board so we had both the beakfast buffet and the dinner buffet on all 3 nights - food was delicious but what is truly worth mentioning is the fantastic service. I really must commend Mr. Kumara Karunaratne ( KK) for his excellent service (we both truly feel he is a role-model to more junior staff members) - he goes down to minute details and goes the extra mile to make guests feel like they are the most important people there. The F & B team too must be commended for their great personalized service despite the high occupancy at the hotel. We were further treated to a beautifully decorated bed every time we got back to our room in the night. So I must not forget to thank the housekeeping team for their thoughtful gesture!! All in all..we had an unforgettable weekend away - where we basked in the luxury of the amenities the hotel had to offer us (the residence pool and the spa were great!)....and most of all were treated to 5 star service which I feel is what this hotel's true USP is!!",positive
"Situated on the beach most rooms have a great view of the beach. The pools are beautiful, the Restaurants and bars are lovely and our room was magnificent. Comfy beds and pillows a wet room in the bathroom plus small lounge area and work desk. Not enough lounges around the pool as most guests (Europeans)claim them in the morning and keep them when they go off to breakfast and lunch, not very considerate of other people. There are not any shops etc near the hotel and the hotel shop has very limited stock. Hawkers will try and sell you sarongs etc from the beach we looked at a table cloth and they wanted 8,000 rupier we ended up getting it for 3,000 so be strong and walk away and if their sales are down they will come looking for you - they cannot walk on the hotel grass so they will stand on the beach and call to you. If you walk the beach the hawkers will be at you - boat trip, restaurant, jewelry shop, sarongs, massage etc be careful a guy named Freddie would not leave us alone.",positive
"We spent 7 nights at the Heritance in Ahungalla, and enjoyed the beach and the pools of the hotel. The hotel is very nice and the hotel facilities were great: 2 large pools and lots of sunchairs and umbrellas for relaxation in the shadow. Our 2 kids spent most of their week in the pool, but the beach and ocean is amazing. There were a red flag on the beach throughout our stay, which meant you should not go into the water, but unfortunately this is only for 'insurance' reasons for the hotel. The waves were big in the afternoon, but the wind and surge were not very dangerous. Small children should probably stay out though. Ahungalla village did not provide any restaurant nor sight of interest, which was a small disappointement. But since the food and buffet at the hotel was outstanding, we did not suffer. We went on day trips to Kosgoda for Sea Turtle Hatchery, which was interesting. I suspect we were tricked by the tuktuk driver to go to a place which was built up only for tourists. Run down and dodgy, but kids loved it because we could hold sea turtle babies in our hands. I would chekc up on these hatcheries, there are apparantly 2-3 to choose from. We also took a boat trip at the Madu river. Basic but still very nice. Recommended, and our local boat driver Dinesh was outstanding. We also used the Spa at the hotel for a Balinese massage, highly recommended.",positive
"Highly recommend this hotel. The food was excellent. The staff was very friendly. Big pool. It's not too far from Colombo. If taking the highway, take the ambalangoda exit though. The aluthgama exit road is still being done up.",positive
"This hotel in the past was one of the best in Sri Lanka,but now it is a well worn ,out of date of the modern class of hotel. Since the name change from the Triton years ago, it's been on a downward spiral.We used to visit every year until the Tsunami occurred,we were there then as well. We revisited it two years later when it re-opened Lots of the old staff that knew what they were doing have gone,replaced by new , not sure of what they're doing. It is now full board, all inclusive has disappeared along with the regular visitors to the hotel.This is now made up by having day visits of Sri Lankan people. This I accept as you need custom. But when I've paid good money to stay in a 5* hotel, and I have to put up with locals using the swimming pool, fully dressed in all the sweaty clothes that they have travelled in, then walking round dripping wet,playing water polo in the pool bawling their heads off, not giving a hoot for the residents,and with kids running wild, then that is the time to take a good look at the hotel and wonder if it is a good place to stay after all. The hotel itself is in need of a good maintenance team,not just the paint brush brigade,covering over cracks. On the beach, you are now pestered from morning to night by the beach sellers, who previously weren't allowed to come close to holidaymakers,but now the exclusion zone is minimal.",positive
We had little sour taste in the mouth on arrival as our room was not ready by 6.00pm. But they made it up thereafter and we had fantastic time The staff were very friendly and helpful. The chefs were fantastic and prepared vegetarian menu which was out of this world.We dined at fine dining which was amazing and all three chefs came to meet us. They also gave guided tour of the kitchen and the award wining cake room.,positive
"its very nice hotel near to sea from swimming pool straight u can go to sea .rooms are very good with balcony ,nice view to sea,swimming pool is very beautiful .we enjoyed a lot.its little scary ,bcz tsunami happened in this area.",positive
"Last stop on our Sri Lankan tour and after being greeted like VIP's at every other hotel, this hotel seemed a little disorganised. However, after our initial hiccup, I can not rave enough about how amazing the service was. We are a very active family and the animator was enthusiastic and would always provide us with new activities to try (despite low uptake from other guests). As vegetarians, I have never come across chefs who take great pride in the food that they serve. After our evening meal in the cafe, the chef came out to see what we thought of the recipe as it was one of his own inventions... and a special mention has to go to the chef and sous-chef in the fine-dining kitchen. I can not believe we were the only ones eating here. They went out of their way to develop a special 5 course vegetarian menu and it was such good value. It that restaurant was in London, it would have been awarded a michelin star without a doubt! The swimming pool is kept very clean and on the doorstep to the beach. Beds very comfortable and shower very good. Great place to end our trip.",positive
"Arrived 2am 28/12/13 reception like an aircraft hanger very open . Shown room not up to standard, buffet breakfast room like a canteen. Definitely not 5 star, complaint made to manager and rep. Rep waste of space . Manager brought in kk restaurant manager . He was very attentive and always seemed to be on duty. We ate of the al carte menu at no extra cost in the mustard cafe waiters provided excellent service worth special mention. Room changed after 3nights. Do not book de luxe rooms these are the basic rooms. You could not beat the staff they were all very helpful and pleasant. Hotel needs a big makeover to make it a 5 star. Fine dining food excellent. Sri Lanka very nice.",positive
"This has to be one of the best resorts in Ahungalla, if not Sri Lanka.The rooms are too class with good privacy. The staff are very friendly and very helpful. The beach is good one, but not the best.The restaurant is very good and you can't go wrong with most items. The only down side is the touts on the beach. Highly recommendable to travelers looking for classy crowd(unlike Goa).",positive
"We only stayed here for one night - it was a beautiful hotel - our room was lovely and great bathroom. The hotel is very open and spacious - we did have a long walk to our room, however we did not mind - we saw monkeys in the trees as we walked to the main hotel area. We had the buffet dinner which was very good - breakfast was the usual Si Lankan fare",negative
"We stayed in this hotel for four nights just before Christmas 2013. The location is stunning, right by the ocean with a fabulous sandy beach. You do get bothered by touts if you venture on to the beach - they are mild by the standards of, say, Egypt, and the hotel are trying to do something about it - but it must be difficult given it is public land. The influence of Geoffrey Bawa is very evident, the bedrooms are spacious and the public areas are very cool and airy. Excellent inventive food, and the staff cannot do enough to ensure you have what you want and need. The main buffet restaurant suffers from being in a rather large room with an oppressively low ceiling covered in a jute batik, and the cooking stations appear rather industrial. However, ask for them to set up a table for you on the lawn and whether it breakfast with the resident egrets in attendance, or dinner under the stars it is a peaceful and magical spot. Strangely they never seem to expect anyone to sit outside even though at every meal many people wanted to, so there was a lot of impromptu furniture moving going on all the time! Our experience of the fine dining restaurant was entirely ruined by the nightly show - the only real ""package holiday"" attribute of this hotel. This particular evening the dancing required all the lights (and I mean all) to be extinguished so that UV light alone would illuminate the dancers. That meant we were plunged into darkness just as our beautifully presented meals were served. We ended up having to illuminate each other's meal with an iPhone torch so we could see anything at all. The show only lasted 30 minutes - why not advise us and ask if we'd like to wait (or find somewhere else to put on the show, or where we could dine with lights? I've waited to review this hotel until I finished the holiday - it claims to be five star - well perhaps against the competition in Sri Lanka where they don't have the benchmark of a Mandarin Oriental, a Raffles or an Oberoi to compare with. It's a good hotel, and probably amongst the best on the island - but don't compare it with the best in India or SE Asia.",positive
"We just stayed one night at Heritance. what a wonderful place it is..!! A special thanks to Asha who made the reservation for us, we were lucky enough to get an upgrade to a luxury room.. The kids really enjoyed the pool, beach and the food. Excellent service by all the staff members. I wish we could stay more but will definitely come back. Everything was so beautiful and immaculate...The food was great... Thank you for making our stay so enjoyable..",positive
"Some of Sri Lanka's seaside resorts have dropped their ubiquitous themes when ushering in a New Year. Such events in the past had been mostly to select the prettiest among those at dinner dances and picking the best dancing couple. This time, however, the Heritance in Ahungalla had a uniquely different theme altogether. The coastal resort which was fully booked was turned into an ""International Airport."" The dinner-dance tickets were turned into ""Passports."" Guests had to queue in to have them sealed by ""Immigration Officers."" Interesting enough the hotel staff were all attired in different uniforms. The General Manager Refhan and his Resident Manager Sampath were in the attire of two pilots. Front office staff wore the uniforms of flight attendants. So did the waiters. Once the passengers were ""cleared"" by ""immigration,"" they were subjected to security checks. The guests walked through a metal detector and had to produce their ""passports"" to be allowed in. The dark backdrop of the coast formed the backdrop for a mock up aircraft. The buffet was right below. Then the fun began and went on till the wee hours of January 1. A remarkable feature was the wide array of international and local food. It has been prepared by Food Olympic award winner Dimuthu Kumarasinghe. A few of the guests I spoke with were thrilled at the new theme, a departure from the mundane annual activity. The following pictures are self explanatory:",positive
"I wish I could stay forever. Remote quite location with nothing else than sound of the ocean. It is worth the 4 hours bus journey from Colombo. All the staff so friendly and profesional, comfortable rooms with rain shower bathroom, safe, minibar, tea maker and the priceless view over endless beach and blue ocean. Huge pool with cocktail service, nice gym, freshly grilled fish in the evening ... just perfection. The whole hotel has very airy open plan and feel spacious and private. Also no other people on the beach so it feels like you have the whole place for yourself. Breakfast was good also...the cucumber juice is the best ever. Turtle sanctuary, georges river delta and busy beaches are near by so you can have all you need few minutes drive away. There are as well some shops outside the gate of the hotel if you need groceries,or pharmacy. It is the perfect hideway and I cant wait to go back.",positive
"Heritance Ahungalla I have just returned from a delightful holiday by the sea at Heritance Ahungalla. Beautifully appointed, and architecturally designed by the renowned Sri Lankan architect Jeffrey Bawa, the Heritance Hotel is simply wonderful. Driving up to the Hotel through the front gates, one passes frangipani and coconut palms and is greeted at the entrance with a feeling of tranquility. The Lobby is vast and open with an infinity pool and the sea is visible too with the sunlight glinting on the waves. Heaven! I found the staff at Heritance courteous and helpful, and as I was visiting with my disabled mother, it was a relief to find them so kind and obliging. Nothing was too much trouble. The Hotel has won numerous international awards for its food. The chefs really turn out a wonderful spread day after day, and meal after meal, at the main restaurant. I was on ‘Half board’. I had my breakfast and supper at the main restaurant and lunch at the Pool Side Bar. I so enjoyed sitting at the pool side bar at lunchtime looking at the sea eating scrumptious fish and chips and prawns with my ice cold beer. One of the nice features of the hotel is that it has two very large swimming pools. Again beautifully appointed among the trees. So they never get too crowded or noisy. Heritance does have tennis courts, spa’s, karaoke bar, organizes boat trips up the river et al. I however was happy to relax by the pool, and have dips in the sea all day long. The beach is pristine white and a walk along it at dawn is a super start to the day. I have visited many beach resorts in Sri Lanka over the years, Heritance is definitely my favourite and I recommend you take a look yourself, when you next need a seaside holiday in the tropics. Elizabeth Gunewardene",positive
"Very good beach hotel, good vegetarian food and fruits. Only concern was in the resident green pool service was very slow due to only one staff covering the whole pool area with snack food being brought from the main pool bar, very courteous staff and friendly staff. Should have more staff in that area .",positive
"After leaving the hotel we realized that we had left a iPad at the hotel, but didnt know where we had misplaced it. It could have been left in the room, pooside or anywhere in the hotel. We called the hotel and they were very professional in locating it and returning it to us promptly. Thank you very much! We have been to Hesitance Ahungalla many times in the past. As always staff and service is here is just exceptional!! Far better than at Cinnamon Bey, Beruwala, which was our next destination which was a nightmare. At Heritance, everyone from the front desk to the pool staff to the restaurant staff to the gentleman who reads palms is friendly, attentive and courteous. The lovely hotel in the beautiful location could do with just a little bit renovation to make things perfect. We will definitely be back!",positive
"Having stayed at this hotel around 8 or 9 times over the last 20 years, we returned with high expectations. I am pleased to be able to say that the actual experience exceeded our expectations. We were given a large room on the top floor, well away from the restaurants and other potential sources of noise. The room was furnished beautifully and the bed was very comfortable. Everything was squeaky-clean and kept that way by our room boy, who also replenished our fruit bowl regularly. The hotel has a superb location at the end of a long beach and we were pleased to find that you can still stroll along its full extent without meeting more than a handful of people. There are two pools and plenty of sunbeds in the extensive garden area, where you can watch the many birds and chipmunks as well as the occasional monitor lizard passing through. We enjoyed the food, particularly the excellent dinner arranged for us by the head chef. The weather during our stay was pretty mixed, but we managed a few dinners at the seafood station by the side of the pool. I would recommend both the food and the relaxed atmosphere there.There is also a small covered 'open-air' restaurant area, where we had some good curries. Breakfast is a sumptuous affair with a wide range of choices, including hoppers and curries as well as the more traditional European-style offerings. There is also a splendid selection of fruit and juices. Whilst the hotel and its facilities are very good indeed, it was the friendliness and efficiency of the staff which really made our stay memorable. We were constantly surprised by the way in which people anticipated our wishes/preferences and provided what we were looking for - and much more - without ever having to ask for it. Truly exceptional service and hospitality! There were many familiar faces amongst the staff and we were also pleased to find that Eranda, our favourite tuk-tuk driver, was still offering his services by the gate. We have used him on many occasions and have found him very accommodating and utterly reliable. Resort areas such as Bentota and Hikkaduwa are within easy reach by tuk-tuk. We even went as far as Unawatuna this time - and enjoyed a 'roti lunch' with Eranda in Galle on the way. (Without him we would have struggled to order anything.) As the title above suggests, we have no complaints whatsoever. We only regretted not being able to stay longer. However, we will certainly try to come back.",positive
"Both of these are symbols of Sri Lanka and it was good to see it displayed so well in this hotel. Food was excellent and the beds were comfortable after a long drive. The rainwater shower was tops! Of course the enormous infinity pool which seems to bring the sea into the hotel, was splendid as usual. All round good marks for this hotel.",positive
"Since we had already experienced the exceptional hospitality at Heritance Kandalama and The Sands at Kalutara (Aitken Spence properties), we booked our Christmas vacation at Heritance Ahungalla a couple of months back to avoid disappointment. When we arrived at the property we were pleasantly surprised to find out that we had been upgraded to the Luxury Suite with the garden balcony. The Suite (room 324) was HUGE compared to a regular room, in fact if I am not mistaken, the bathroom of the suite probably had the same square footage as a regular room, with a 2 person bathtub, a shower stall, double sinks and a huge walk in closet. The suite was richly appointed with real furniture including a small library. My 13yr old was thrilled to find an age appropriate book by Rick Riordan that she had not previously read. The bedroom had a comfortable king sized Four Poster bed and a recliner. Mini fridge, TV, surround sound system and tea/coffee service rounded off the comforts. Food was excellent as this hotel's chefs had emerged as the Most Outstanding Culinary Team in Sri Lanka after competing against both international and domestic star-class city and resort hotels at the 15th Culinary Art Competition. Sous chef Roshan Pujitha was kind enough to show us some of the culinary masterpieces and their chocolate factory. Most nights were theme nights, and on the night where they served Chinese food, we were prepared to order A la Carte for our daughter who has nut allergies, but the server quickly brought her a plate of Lasagna from another restaurant at no extra charge. the wait staff was attentive and responded to our requests in a timely manner. The rooms were clean and well stocked with fresh towels, bath robes and bottled water. The room steward came every evening to make sure we had fresh towels and to turn down the beds. Fresh fruit was also delivered to the room. The only issue we had was, we wanted the vacation over Christmas, but we were told that the hotel was booked solid. This was not the case as there were plenty of vacant rooms available. This was a bit of a disappointment since we really wanted to be away during Christmas. It was a pleasant surprise to meet Ms Niranjala the hostess, who was also at Heritance Kandalama during our visit to that property in August, and she recognized us and came over to chat. It was an enjoyable experience and a great vacation.",neutral
Staying at heritance ahungalla was indeed a superb experience.The main buffet was extremely delecious and the staff were very helpful when anything extra was needed. The rooms were very clean and the room service very efficient. Hospitality was at its best and it was nice to see all the staff well mannered. It felt like being at home,positive
"My 13 year old daughter and I spent 4 glorious days in the hotel. The staff are very friendly and helpful, the rooms are spacious and comfortable and they have a daily program of activities which include water aerobics, beach volleyball, stretching and pool games. The activities suit all ages and are loads of fun. We have been travelling the world for 8 months and the staff at this hotel are the best we have come across. Not only are they good at their jobs but they take great pride in their hotel. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel. I would recommend that any families with children stock up on snacks before arriving at the hotel.",positive
"This hotel was the first destination of our honeymoon. The cool and calm environment that one encounters as you drive through the gates up to the reception is certainly inviting and to say that reflects the hotel's outlook would be an understatement. The check in was breezy with a warm welcoming service by the front office staff - now that's what I call hospitality. Although the room we got was located in the far corner, the room condition and facilities were simply breathtaking. The snacks provided were somewhat overwhelming but they tasted so well, that one would be stupid to resist. The Jacuzzi was a mind-blowing experience. As for the hotel service, I simply don't know how they do it, but they will be there at your doorstep literally seconds after you keep the phone. The restaurant and its management have won many accolades which they proudly display at the entrance. It was not before long that we realised why they receive them. The food is simply amazing with an endless spread. To walk around and have a look alone can fill you up. The flavours blend so well and they know how to exert the correct balance of tastes especially in local cuisines. The action stations were constantly full of action with a variety from prawns, sausages, bacon and waffles steaming continuously. Despite serious time restrictions and a house full of guests, the staff will go the extra mile just to see that smile on your face. The weekend extravaganza is something that one should not miss. On Fridays and Saturdays, the hotel features a cultural extravaganza with traditional and contemporary performances including the occasional fire limbo. Simply worth the time. The locality of the area features picteresque river boat rides to which the hotel also has some arrangements at additional cost. We could not make this journey, but previous experiences suggest that this cannot fail. The only option for improvement that I could think for the hotel is that it shows no signage for anyone plying from the South towards it. Whilst motorists from Colombo along the Galle Road (A2) would not miss the hotel sign, we travelled along the expressway (E1) to come up from south. Nearly missed the turn but managed not to overshoot it too much thanks to some roadside assistance. All in all, this was the first destination upon entering matrimony, and the warm service and comfortable outing at Heritance Ahungalla will be etched in our memories forever. A surefire revisiting option for us.",positive
"We stayed here for one night towards the end of our trip to Sri Lanka and had a fantastic time. The hotel is right on the beach and the pools are lovely. We are at the Mustard Cafe and enjoyed a delicious Lobster Dinner. The staff have to be one of the hotel's best features, everyone was polite, professional and very helpful our waiter in particular (whose name I can't now remember) was wonderful. We highly reccomend!",positive
A place you will be treated as a family. You will find a staff who sill look after you very well. They will provide you a good service. And the Pool area is really cool with the Sea very relaxing. Housekeeping guys are like machines. You can enjoy a Dinner with Fire light in the beach area.,positive
"This hotel has the friendliest staff of all the hotels of this category that I have been in SL,UK,USA and India. They work as a very good team to entertain us and to help us in all the possible ways.Rooms were in good quality and house keeping guys were very efficient.There were two good swimming pools.outdoor badminton court was not very good because of the wind.It would be very nice if they had an indoor badminton court.All of the other facilities were very good.",positive
"If you are looking to chill out this is the place to stay, although make sure driver takes you on new road to get there from airport, two & half hours! Staff very friendly & attentive, plenty of food choices, lovely pool but wild seas not brilliant for swimming in. We really enjoyed the relaxation, not many English people! Spa worth visiting, grounds & public areas well maintained, lovely views from rooms.",positive
"Our stay was very enjoyable and relaxing. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Our luxury suite was excellent and we have no complaints with the quality of this accommodation once inside. Overall the quality of service and facilities were very good. However, two areas that need to be improved are: i) The drab and poor condition of the décor of the walkways leading to the bedrooms and the condition of many of the bedroom doors need to be improved to meet the standard expected of a top quality hotel. ii) Although service was excellent overall we noticed that used plates and empty bottles from room service were left outside rooms for two days before being removed.",positive
"Hi went here for just over 2 weeks for our honeymoon and have to say it was the best holiday we could have possibly asked for!! on arrival we instantly felt welcome at this hotel! We only had bed and breakfast so had to buy our evening meals. We are vegetarian and explained to the staff that there inst much vegetarian food on here that we like! 10 minutes later the head chef came out to speak to us about what sort of food we would like, 1 hour later we had out own personal menu with 10 vegetarian dishes to chose from. we got to use that menu for the whole stay and when I say the food was amazing!! wow it was amazing! out of 16 days, we stayed within the resort for 14 of the days, didnt feel the need to leave. the water ball games at 11am were really fun! feeding and going on the horse ride was great. Spa was really good! the days we did leave, we went to goal which is a near by town one day and we had a really good time. the other day we went to a few different places but I would really recommend the piniwala elephant sanctuary!the best part is went you walk with them to the lake where they have free play time, a truly amazing experience.",positive
"It is our first trip to Sri-Lanka, but not the first trip to other country from Ukraine, that is why we have something to compare. We are in hotel Heritance Ahungalla, Deluxe Room on the first floor. During our 10 days we had nice time without rain. Tomorrow our last day in this country, we already saw everything and now we can objectively evaluate this hotel. The nature is wonderful here, beautiful ocean, many animals, so sweet fruits. The biggest plus in this hotel - people. Staff extra good, helpful and kind. I want to write about Thushara Gnanarathe - R&B Manager in Heritance. He is responsible for resto and bar. Food very good and so tasty! Service is perfect. But hotel is old, rooms need new life, tables in the rooms not new, bathroom is not modern. We saw many hotels and this one is not 5 stars, as for us. I think CEO of this hotel must update his hotel, rooms need nowadays breathing. And in conjunction with your ideal staff your hotel will be real 5 stars too. Thank you!",positive
"It is our second time at the hotel, you come to place twice only if it worth it. This hotel absolutly desrve the title of best hotel in Sri Lanka! I want to mention the great rooms, the beautiful view, freindly staff, and exellent,professional, and very special and delicious kitchen! I recommend this hotel to everyone!",positive
"During our 4 weeks we had really a very nice time a part from some rain in the evening.Beachfront hotel large and well kept property, Room confortable with everything you need, rooms a little too dark in the evening.Towels and bedsheet in perfect conditions, rooms very clean.Staff kind and helpful also in the 2 pools, the pool attendents were always ready to give you new towels and to help you to change place when necessary.The food in the main restaurant , usually self service, is various and abundant, of course You must like oriental food, not accordingly to european tast, but very spicy, ( not strong or pure fire,) just spicy as a matter of fact the majority of the guest are arabs, indians, and other asian countries.For us italian was OK. Good entertainment afternoon and evening, fire works, shows , music etc.Something special was the man playing flute in the morning at the main pool.What was not good at all, was the great quantity of russian, ukrain and soviet people, noisy,arrogant,impolite, mainly dressed with shorts, shirts withouth sleeves and sandals, and all this at the main restaurant. Also a great deal of small children were roaming shouting and screaming in the main restaurant sometimes . In a 5 star hotel this is not acceptable!!!! In any case this hotel is good and advisable. bruno e marisella torino italia",positive
"What can I say, this place is simply amazing, the staff are the most friendliest lovely people on the face of the earth, nothing is too much trouble, if something isnt to your taste the cooks will specially make something for you, I could not have felt more welcome or more like part of the big family that is Heritance Ahungalla. The rooms are relaxing, clean and tidy and are cleaned by lovely people leaving flowers or towel animals on the bed. The bathroom is lovely with a big rain shower head- fantastic hot water!!!!! The grounds and pool are kept up to a very high standard and you can always be assured of fluffy fresh towels when visiting the pool. The breakfast and dinners are buffet but they have two restaurants to choose from so variety isn't a problem - they also have dinners on the beach - very romantic and I would recommend it!!! Also free Wifi in rooms and everywhere on grounds. I stayed for 3 nights and only wished it could have been longer..... Only downside is beach touts trying to sell sarongs or trips - they can't come onto ground security chases them away but once you're on the beach you're fair game- be firm but polite and they leave you alone. But Heritance Ahungalla you are amazing I will be back to stay again!!",positive
Stayed at the Heritance Hotel for 3 nights in October and was rather disappointed with the quality of the rooms and the rest of the building. It seems to me that many of the bigger hotels in Sri Lanka that trade as 5 star are in much need of refurbishment. Heritance - spend some money on the joint. 3 star at the best. Matthew Melbourne Australia,neutral
"I stayed at the Heritance ahungalla for 7 nights and could not have asked for a more perfect stay. The hotel and grounds are stunning and the staff are the nicest, friendliest, most helpful people I have met. Especially Niroshan who cleaned our room and left us amazing towel animals. Food was outstanding every day and the restaurant staff were attentive and always went out of their way to make you feel special. Rooms were simply decorated and tasteful which makes them relaxing. I cannot wait until I can come back to this country, this hotel and the hospitality you find here",positive
"stayed here last week for six nights last week everything is superb lovely rooms fantastic staff made us very welcome and nothing was to much trouble, pools, beach etc all gorgeous, food was superb we mostly ate at the mustard cafe which was our favourite but all were good ,did some trips also river safari is worth going on and went to galle on the train from the local station all in all a very good well run hotel a credit to the staff and sri lanka",positive
Well clean hotel with greet full housekeeping staff. Also nice lobby area with straight pool and sea view. Housekeeping EPA always keep in touch with us. Great service. I love to be at bar area in the evening time. Superb bar in down south. I love this hotel.,positive
"This hotel was booked following recommendations. The booking process was not straightforward but we were very pleased with the service we received, once we arrived. Check in was smooth and friendly and the service as a whole was very good. Beautiful surroundings to include a large pool with the beach just beyond. Total relaxation! Food was good and the choice was great too. Will have no hesitation booking this hotel again and recommending to friends.",positive
"We had come from Colombo via Dambulla and Kandy to stay at the highly recommended Heritance Ahungalla in Galle. No disappointment here. Wonderful impression when you arrive and the sea lies just beyond the pool through the lobby. Much has been said about the genius of architect, Geoffrey Barwa. The building is beautifully designed and a pleasure to be in and to look at. The rooms are stylish, comfortable and well maintained. Staff are extremely friendly, happy, attentive and keep smiling even when dealing with large groups of demanding, ill mannered tour groups. Food is good. Beach is clean and well patrolled. (important because of the very strong rip) Huge pool. Lots of activities. In all, a great place for a relaxing holiday and a base to explore the surrounding cultural sites. OH.....don't forget....the Heritance has the BEST TOILET PAPER IN THE WORLD!!",positive
"We arrived at the Heritance Ahungalla following a week's tour of the cultural triangle so were ready for the relaxing part of our holiday. We were given a very warm welcome and pleasant check in experience by being offered a refreshing drink and relaxing as the check in was conducted. Then we were shown to our room which was very modern and beautifully appointed - no bath but excellent shower as well as the other high quality fittings. The room was large with a spacious balcony offering views of the main pool and sea. Each day the room was attended to at least twice by the cleaning team who added delightful touches such as flowers on the bed and beautiful designs created by folding towels into swans etc. The food was very good with a wide choice of mouth-watering dishes every day and the staff were so friendly and warm - sincere smiles greeted us everywhere. They seemed to be proud of their hotel and took great pride in their work at all levels. This included the pool attendants who would do all they could to ensure all guests were quickly provided with towels etc. The only downside was not being able to walk onto the beach without being accosted by a swarm of touts - not the hotel's responsibility as the beach is a public area, but I thought it might be an idea for the hotel to engage with the touts and perhaps educate them to the buying behaviours of European tourists - we are far less likely to purchase items or services if we feel in anyway 'hounded' into it. Perhaps the touts could be encouraged to have a bazaar style set up on the beach where I am sure tourists would actively visit and buy. Just a thought, but otherwise, a great stay, great staff and an overall wonderful experience.",positive
"We went to heritance for a weekend get away. We booked in to a standard room, and they were nice enough to upgrade us to a luxury suite. In terms of dining, we felt that the starters were great, but the main course was not that great. The service was exceptional, though the dinning area was full and very busy, there was always a waiter around to serve us. Its a great comfortable hotel, with exceptional service.",positive
"Very disappointed with our stay. Rooms definitely need upgrades. Stayed in a triple room where the third bed was just a small folding bed. Blinds in the bathroom were broken and could see through them from the room and the outside. Flies in the room. Communicated all this to front desk but nothing done about it. The second pool was ""apparently"" under maintenance every time us locals wanted to use it but all the foreigners were constantly swimming!!!!! Again spoke to front desk and we were told the pool was not closed???? Very sad is all I have to say. If this is what we call 5 star then I have no words. Will not be staying here again.",negative
"The Heritance Ahungalla has an amazing beach right in front of the building. Make sure you get sea view and enjoy a fantastic sight. The beach is sandy and and very big so you feel sort of lost in paradise. The sea is rough but perfect to go for a bodysurf and the local lifeguard always keeps an eye on people. Apart from the scenery do not forget to eat for dinner in the local restaurant, the young cook is absolutely outstanding and a very nice person to have a chat with.",positive
"Ahungalla Heritance Hotel is reassuring when you arrive through its private clean drive after passing the entrance arch gate. It keeps being reassuring when you discover the open reception onto the swimming that leads your gaze straight into the Indian Ocean just few meters away. It is a large hotel of 152 rooms and was originally the Triton Hotel redesigned by the famous architect Geoffrey Bawa who had a vision of wrapping the indoor with the outdoor as he did for this reception hall; this architectural effect hypnotizes your senses until … you are checking in; for our check in we were lead to a bar behind the reception which was very dark, most of its lights were switch off (environmental ??), this gave us the strange feeling that the hotel was trying to save electricity. Not really our expectation of a “5*” hotel standard. To tell you the truth I started to be suspicious at this moment as this appear to me as a symptom of a poor management. This significant detail was like the top of an iceberg that would lead us to the discovery of the rest of it. Was Heritance Ahungalla a 5* iceberg? The room was ok. We enjoyed the little terrace where we were having our coffee. Yet the room has aged and would need a lift. It is no equipped with a safe deposit so if you bought gems stones along your trip (very probable as anyone can understand) .. better check with the reception if they can keep them safe for you. The hotel and room for instance maintenance seems secondary for this “5*” hotel as we noticed in our room a splash of dirt on the terrace door window. We believe that rooms are cleaned by the house keeping employees but no housekeeping supervisors check them or not properly. There are two swimming pools, the main one at the reception that dives into the ocean (visually) and the other one which I preferred for its quietness and its tropical tree that grows over it like mangrove. The Mustard coffee shop where we ate once (we had a 3 days stay) was nothing special, we ordered a seafood salad and when served, it looked like no salad at all, no veggies or leaves were composing the dish, it looked like a cold seafood stew in a dark dressing. We had to ask for additional fresh leaves and vegetable … a sald. The Mustard coffee shop floor is cover of pavement like those used in European old streets, we were not disturbed by the crowd only a table of 2 and 4 were having late lunch. We checked the “Upper Restaurant” or the “prime Restaurant” menu, open 7pm to 10pm and were not impressed by the menu presentation neither by the incomprehensive culinary composition of its dishes, a so call sophisticated fusion Cuisine (Sorry chef but …). The restaurant was empty … lack of soul, poor lighting, no spark. We did not go. We felt the price not too friendly as well. Instead we were curious to check this little Coconut Hut restaurant “Sunshine view” down the beach (not part of the hotel). We were attracted by the freshness of its seafood that Berthy the owner presented to us earlier in the afternoon. We appreciated Berthy “not pushy” manner. We really enjoyed our grilled king prawns garlic sauce at Rp3000 per portion actually the portion is a set as these very large prawns, almost baby lobster size, came with a generous fresh mix salad and fried rice plus a fresh fruit salad served in chilled dish (very Pro) thank you to Berthy. We had few beers, Rp 150 only, a very satisfying diner and tasty one we had there, we recommend. Back to Heritance, we were not blown by the auto glorifying video that is played in random on one of the hotel TV channel, it sounded too good to be true and in fact it was. The Heritance corporate management needs to open its eyes, international real 5* hotel are on their way to Sri Lanka and soon these competitors may be at the beginning of Heritance Hotels losing stars. The food & beverage department should also be concerned and hurry up in revising its restaurants concepts and put its heart and mind into it.",positive
"Having traveled and stayed for extended periods of time in the US, UK, Dubai and a few Asian countries and enjoyed what some of their hotels have to offer I have to say I have found my Home away from Home at Heritance Ahungalla! having stayed there 7 times I think I can say that I know what I am talking about. The staff at the entrance have always been very welcoming, and it is nice to see a few familiar faces when we walk in. The last few visits have been with our lil baby and they made sure that we are checked in within no time. Within a few minutes of us calling, a cot was delivered and set up. We are very concerned with the rooms being clean and free of any dust, The rooms were spotless and the toilets were very clear. The food at the fine dinning restaurant was excellent. It was quite obvious that a lot of attention to detail had been given. The level of service was even better. It was very kind of the waiter to push the stroller around with our baby to calm him down when he was getting a bit restless, Even the chef who came to the table to inquire about the food was entertaining baby with his hat. We did not ask either one of the to do this nor did we expect them to, This for us was going above and beyond the call of duty. At the buffet we are always greeted at the entrance with big smile, the food, the variety and the service have all been of the highest order. During the week end during peak season there have been times where the service has been a bit slow due to the packed buffet hall. Generally the staff would inquire about the food and the service. A few observations, Wheel chair access to the buffet hall (Didnt see/notice it from the mail entrance) also the use of long carpets to connect the buffet hall with the mail hotel during heavy rain. Reading some of the bad reviews I was really shocked because All most of of the staff that we have encountered have been pleasant and helpful. I must take a moment to give credit to a few members of staff who we feel deserve recognition for their service as well as the lengths they go, to ensure the guest are well looked after, Gamini who is always checking up on guests make sure all our needs and requirements are taken care of, Thushara will visit every table at the buffet and see to all the guests culinary requirements are met and last but not least Sampath who seems to make it his mission to make every guest's stay at Ahungalla a memorable and special one, My wife as well as I can vouch for this having spent a wedding Anniversary & Birthday at Ahungalla and plan to go there for many more.",positive
"A big call I know, but this hotel has ticked so many boxes and more that I didn't even think existed. It's located in an amazing setting. The luxury is over the top but not ostentatious. The service is exactly right...genuine and taking care of all your needs. And then the room!: we stayed in the Tendulkar suite and man o man o man...it was AMAZING. We were really living the high life! :-) It has a massive bathroom with a central bath/Jacuzzi (it comfortably fitted myself, my wife and 2 kids). And a corner balcony that overlooks the tennis courts, the ocean and the pool(s). The bed was super comfortable and BIG. The swimming pools wrap the hotel - they are cater for small kids, adults and teens by being deep, shallow and bordering on the bars. And if pools aren't your thing, the beach is literally at the pools edge.",positive
One of the best resort properties in this part of the globe...you might just start liking it so much...you might not miss home...:(. The food is excellent...very genuine hotel staff...cant wait to go back again.,positive
Stayed here with my wife after a week in a hotel in the north of Sri Lanka. The food in the buffet was extremely poor. The al carte was very expensive which would of been ok if the food was good but it was terrible. We had bolognese one day and the spaghetti had been cut up in to tinny pieces or they had served us the crumbs at the bottom of the packet. Second time we ate there the lasagna was also terrible. It had been reheated so much that that the pasta literally could not be cut let alone eaten. When we complained it took nearly half hr and a six man conference In the kitchen to come to the conclusion that it was not edible. We then decided to try the fine dinning restaurant only to find out it was the same chef from the al carte restaurant ! We ate in local restaurants from then on which were really nice and a fraction of the price. Finally upon checking out we were charged for basically the entire mini bar ! After disputing this are bill was quite quickly adjusted to what we had actually taken from the mini bar. In conclusion the hotel is drab over priced and you are extorted at ever opportunity ! My advise would be to keep well away,negative
We agree with our fellow reviewer a few days ago (who had enjoyed his second visit here); we spent five days here in October 2013 - our ninth visit - and continue to be delighted with this place. Some members of staff are now just like old friends; we are also very happy to see newer staff members settling in and being actively encouraged to excel. Our thanks to everyone for a wonderful stay....AGAIN!!!,positive
"Having just returned, the 4 of us would like to thank at the staff for a excellent and memorable first stay in Sri Lanka - we will be back. The staff were so friendly (as was everyone we met), so helpful and so attentive to our needs - too many to mention by name. The pool attendants are superb, being very proactive and nothing was too much trouble. The rooms were very good, the room boy did an excellent job, and the amenities more than matched our needs for a relaxing time. The food was superb, especially the desserts with the only downside being a tendency to over eat to try to sample everything as well as the local Lion beer/lager being ""more than acceptable"". The pool settings are memorable and we especially enjoyed the residents pool albeit the view from the main pool is fantastic. The local wildlife was varied and will keep your interest. Location wise, there is much to see around this area of the island if you want to venture around and it does not cost a lot to do so. The ""hawkers"" on the beach are fine - have experienced much worse. They are polite and accept a ""not interested"" answer if you are polite in doing so. The time of the year is important for overseas visitors to see the hotel at its best I expect in that we did experience rain every day, given it was the end of the monsoons and moving into high season. The rain ranged from a light shower to amazing electrical storms but the staff always did a great job of mopping up and it did not detract from our holiday but I can see that it might at different times of the year if constant. As a suggestion - why not put most of the hotel TV (Channel 1) onto your web site as it tells a great story and would be a VG selling aide to help future travellers select your hotel in particular, in that once visited, you sell yourselves as to a return trip in the future. Thanks for a great time.",positive
"I have been to Sri Lanka on many occasions over the last 10 years, often combining work and leisure. My experience of Heritance hotels has been consistently good and Ahungalla was no exception. As with the other Bawa properties I have visited in Sri Lanka (Kandalama and Gallery Cafe for example), Ahungalla is beautifully crafted out of local materials, respects local traditions and also meets the needs of a tropical climate. Ahungalla is also located to provide a stunning view out to the Indian Ocean and several pools from which to enjoy the experience. Perhaps more importantly, the location and architecture are complemented with a warm and extremely professional team of hotel staff. Indeed, in my 30 plus visits to Sri Lanka, only Kandalama has exceeded this hotel in terms of service quality. I co-organised an academic conference at Ahungalla in September 2013, and many of the 142 local and international delegates were equally complimentary of the overall experience, but particularly the architecture and service quality. Unlike many other hotels that host similar events, Ahungalla also benefits from having conference halls somewhat separate from the main hotel. This benefits delegates and hotel guests alike, with the conference proceedings not distracting from the ambience of the hotel. The only slight downside is access. As with much of Sri Lanka, roads are not that good and congestion is common. The Expressway has helped somewhat, but it runs some way from the coast, where most hotels are located. Access from the airport is also difficult, but when the Outer Circular opens, which will bypass Colombo, this will certainly alleviate most of the access difficulties. Despite this and overall, an excellent experience and while I don't visit down South that often, when I do, I shall definitely look to stay at Ahungalla in the future.",positive
"The hotel was quite good. The staff were very friendly and the hotel was clean and well organized. I especially liked the swimming pool area facing the beach. Although, there were a couple of things that could be improved. For one thing, the rooms I stayed in had a few maintenance issues (the ac was not working properly for one of the rooms and the shower drain was clogged). Rooms where not that great. The food in the hotel was good but not nothing special compared to other hotels I've visited in Sri Lanka. Another thing that was lacking were the sports and recreation facilities. All in all, it was a nice stay but I definitely would not the best in Sri Lanka",positive
"Nothing matches the exurburent architecture of Jeffrey Bawa than a great location, excellent service and great food. All of this can be found in the Heritance Ahungalla. Having stayed at both this Heritance and the Heritance in Kandalama which is also another Bawa architectural masterpiece..I can count myself as being a truly lucky man.. The hotel, the ambience and the ways the staff and the team go out of their way to make you feel welcomed, this is truly a 5 star experience. Lovde every minute of my weekend stay. Since I work in Colombo, I will be coming back to these Heritance hotels! Great weekend!",positive
"As the title says, this was my second trip to Sri Lanka. I was determined not to repeat any destination. The only exception I made was for Heritance Ahungalla, because I had had the most amazing time there on my previous visit. And I couldnt imagine going to Sri Lanka without staying at Ahungalla atleast for a short while. I was not disappointed. In fact, I was so surprised because they have made an already excellent property even better. We drove straight 7 hours from Kandalama, so we werent feeling too good when we arrived. But the moment we arrived, we were surrounded by smiling , caring faces who whisked us away, sat us down, gave us cool towels, refreshing drinks within seconds without once hassling us unnecessarily about things. Check in was smooth. We were given an upgrade to a luxury suite (we had booked a regular one). Not only us , but the family travelling with us was also given an upgrade to match us. The moment they heard it was our second visit, nothing was too much to ask. The rooms were great. The property looked absolutely fabulous. The manager called us up to find out if we were comfortable and whether we were happy with the room. WE had a lovely meal at the coffee shop , and we were soo well served by Dharshana. Infact, Dharshana really made our stay for the next two days special by looking after our every need. Nothing was too much to do for him. Next morning, we were given an upgrade to their best suite on the top floor. My son was especially excited because it is named after Sachin TEndulkar and has many of his memorabilia on display. He actually stayed there. The two pools , the beach , the food are all to die for. They have now installed a lift which was missing earlier.Every request is fulfilled with a smile. There are activities planned by the hour eg pool aerobics, water polo...very enjoyable and relaxing day spent. Lots of things to do and very peaceful as well, if you prefer. The beach is as pretty as ever.. But what really makes it special are the people, the service, and the smiling faces. Thanks everyone, and especially Dharshana. We hope to be back soon. Food was excellent as always. However, I think some additions are required to the vegetarian menu, especially for Indian guests. I also sorely missed the seafood restaurant which existed earlier. But may I say that I seem to remember that the buffets last time were even more lavish, especially the fruits. But I was told that this isnt really the season for fruits so perhaps April is a better time to visit for that.",positive
"Good rooms with all amenities in a beautiful beach resort. Excellent and immediate service. As an added plus, the hotel offers a fine dining experience that truly is..fine dining. Designer food presented in an attractive venue. To spark our interest, we were presented with the days fresh catch for review by the chef. Unlike anything else we've found in Sri Lanka after three weeks of travel. Also enjoyed a tour of their remarkable kitchen by Executive Chef, Kasum Premachandra and further look at their extraordinary chocolate making by trainee cook B.H. Lakshan. Good food and lots of fun.",positive
"I was in Sri Lanka for the second time. Prior to this trip would never have believed that Sri Lanka has such a luxurious hotel with a very kind and responsive staff. The ocean is not deep at the hotel, my 9 year old daughter a lot of swimming in the ocean. The beach boys are friendly, trying to help. If you have forgotten something - be sure to bring in, do not steal. Very good food, I recommend HB",positive
"We had a wonderful and relaxing stay. The suite was large and beautifully furnished,and had a Jacuzzi tub in the bathroom. Very close to the beach and the suite opened out to a private patio right by the pool. The food was delicious and varied. The staff was very friendly, courteous and helpful. My wife and I had a great stay and will definitely come back the next time we visit Sri Lanka.",positive
"Had the pleasure of spending 14 nights at this hotel. Firstly I would like to thank the friendly staff for all their hard work, they made our stay perfect. An extra thank you to Thilina in housekeeping for the fantastic service and all his hard work, you really do go that extra mile to make the rooms special by adding that extra touche, I loved the elephant (room 254) Also thank you to the pool attendance (green pool) for their hard work, the sun loungers and towels where ready for us every morning and thank you to kithsiri for inflating our lilos. All the bar and restaurant staff gave a fantastic service too, Rohana always ensured all our needs were met with a smile. Narmika and the young lady stood at the door in the breakfast room most mornings always gave us a warming welcome. All the members of staff were friendly and couldn't do enough to make our staff perfect. I would recommend the fine dinning restaurant, the food was amazing. The coffee shop served great food too, ideal for an afternoon snack or even a evening meal and all reasonably priced. The rooms were comfortable and clean, good supply of clean towels every day, a balcony with a lovely view, excellent air conditioning and ceiling fan and complimentary tea, coffee and sugar everyday. You need to take extra care when walking through the corridors as they can become slippery due to the humidity level and when returning to the room late at night it's always good idea to have the light on your phone handy because the lights are turned off, maybe sensors on the lights are a way forward in the future. I would recommend this hotel, the staff are hard working, very friendly and go out their way to make your stay a memorable one, the hotel grounds are immaculate, great food and entertainment. Everything you need for a relaxing holiday. Can't wait to see you all again next year. Sri Lanka at its best",positive
"The overall experience was very good. The location, the sea, the rooms, the staff and the entire property was excellent. The food was very good. Was woken up by the sound of waves in the morning. Wonderful experience. One of the best hotels that I stayed in Sri Lanka. Truly a memorable stay.",positive
"Out-of-this-world food, we found ourselves pigging out. Heavenly pools and hot tub. Very luxurious rooms. Friendly and considerate staff. Lovely beach and waves. Convenient location. Beautiful layout. Had a memorable stay. Wish it could have been longer.",positive
This hotel was simply amazing. From the time we arrived the checkin was very smooth. Then we were taken to our room which was small but very nice and well furnished. The room was clean with new furniture and a ocean view balcony. The architecture and view in this hotel were amazing. From swimming pool to its proximity to the beach everything made it a unique experience. The food is also good with big variety. However we faced only one drawback during breakfast where the dinning hall was smelly so we had to sit outside to avoid it. I strongly recommend this hotel to other travelers.,positive
"We arrived to red carpet treatment and band, albeit for the wrong bus as another group bus pulled in behind us. The welcome was meant for them. We were a bus load of 2 families returning from a family wedding. We were greeted, given welcoming drinks and escorted to our rooms. With 3 small children in our group, we have been catered for with high chair readily available (a safety harness would be an advantage here) and children's meals have appeared promptly. Swimming pool is very child friendly with plenty of space for everyone. Thilina, our room attendant, surprised the children by making towel elephants and went out of his way to make sure we were happy with the room. Beautiful setting, friendly and helpful staff and great food.",positive
"My wife and I were married at Heritance Ahungalla in September 2013. We had the most fantastic time and we can't thank the hotel enough for the care and attentionthey gave us. If only I could rate the service below as a 6 then I would! I'll start the review with the hotel itself. What an amazing entrance! You make your way down the winding drive and are then presented with this beautiful vista across the ornamental pond, through the reception colonade and across the pool and onto the sea. Truely breathtaking. The staff welcomed us at the car with cool towels and drinks and we were made to feel like kings! The staff were so happy and smiley and exuded a real warmth which really resonated with us. The hotel itself is an architectural gem with so many lovely little areas, all with their own character, and it handsomely rewards exploration. The rooms were beautiful and comfortable and every night we found our bed covered in fresh petals and our towels made into an array of animals! Every meal was fantastic and the selection of food changes daily with so many delicious Sri Lankan dishes to choose from. The wedding was something which we didn't know exactly what to expect. We booked it having never even been to the country before and were a little trepidacious at what to expect. We neededn't have been. The hotel were absolutely amazing and took care of everything for us. We booked the Managalam package with them but they were happy to change details here and there and even threw in a few items as a surprise on the day which we were delighted with. A big thank you to Neranjala for all her help getting our special day arranged. The ceremony was in a beautiful setting on the beach, which we arrived at in style as part of a procession of drummers and dancers through the hotel. The ceremony was a lot of fun and full of lots of little details which delighted our guests. The highlight was the elephant ride at the end - well it beats going away in a car with tin cans on the back! The evening reception and meal could not have been more special. We'd like to thank K.K for all his help in arranging the food, drinks and entertainment. The weather forecast was changeable so they set us up a table outside in the gardens as well as one indoors and sectioned off a whole area of the restaurant for our meal. The food was amazing and they even snuck in an ice sculpture which delighted us. We had a fantastic cultural show and fireworks as well as part of the evening's entertainment which we would highly recommend too. Overall we had the most wonderful time there, as did our guests. Their attention to detail and level of service was unlike anything we've experienced before and both of us agree that we'd like to go back. This is the only place we've ever stayed where we would go back to stay again, just for the hotel. Thank you Heritance Ahungalla, you really gave us a wedding to remember.",positive
"A place that will force you to think that you are a king. THe service is excellent and beyond 5 stars. Compared to all other hotels, the staff is really friendly & the service is outstanding. Superb.Great staff and service! Loved the beach and hotel ambiance. One of the places you should visit when you are alive. A wonderful place.",positive
"We spent 2 days in the hotel and it was a lovely experience. Buffets are very good. however, it could have been better. however, we had to wait for more than 2 hours to check in as the room was not ready. finally we checked in around 4pm. That is the only negative comment i'll have to mention. however, we don't mind visiting again in near future simply because of the food, pool and the long island iced tea/mojito served at the pool bar.",neutral
"Great staff and service! Loved the beach and hotel ambiance! They throw an excellent breakfast buffet with heavenly pan cakes, waffles, omelets and so much more! Sri lankan dishes int he lunch buffet are to die for. Overall its a perfect vacation :)",positive
My friends and I went to visit a factory and came to ahungalla for Lunch their food was amazing and the service was excellent. They have a very friendly staff their warm and welcoming nature made us want to stay more. The animators were really fun too. We had an amazing time!,positive
We stayed just one night due to our busy schedule. But the experience was fantastic and all the food was fabulous !!!!!!! The staff was very friendly and helpful. Definitely will visit next time !!!!!,positive
"This was a one of a kind experience. Me and my family were part of our organisations annual trip. The Ambient and the interior was more relaxing. The Lobby with the sea view over the swimming pools surface, creates magnificent scene. The staff s hospitality and the service is remarkable. The events organised by the hotel in the evenings attracted most of the travelers. These events are in a wide variety from traditional Sri Lankan dancing to modern creative dancing. There was soft piano music or a flute play during the tea time. The commute to the hotel is easy ans its just along the Colombo Galle main road. The tours can be easily arranged to Hikkaduwa Coral Reefs, The famous boat rides at Madu River or to the nearby turtle hatchery. The hotel has a wide variety of food, which is very tasty. This is one of those hotels in Sri Lanka I can name ""worth on what you pay for"".",positive
"Post our long journey from Nuvara Eliya we arrived at Heritance, with a great welcome and briefing we were left at our wonderful room.. Thanks to the upgrade :-). Fantastic view and facilities perfectly matching our requirements of having a relaxed break. Food was excellent with a good spread and helpful staff with our two year kiddo around. Could have been better with wifi as we had to go to the lobby for better signals. We would definitely select this hotel next time....",positive
"We spent only one night there but it was a very relaxing stay. The residents pool is definitly the way to spend day and is spacious enough to have a bit of personal space for families. Enjoyed the food, it was not a large spread but the selection was excellent. Would suggest that action stations keep their food warm even after its cooked otherwise it tends to lose the flavour(prawns).",positive
"We stayed here for two weeks in September/October and loved every minute. The staff were brilliant - attentive, helpful and friendly, including the 'behind the scenes' staff such as the Chefs. We are vegetarian and having spoken to the Foods and Beverage Manager he arranged it so we could have dishes tailored to us. We were also given a guided tour of the kitchens and shown the various prizes the culinary team have won. They have a resident 'Olympic' Chef who has won many gold medals at the Olympics of the food world. There are two beautiful pools and as we were off-peak they were very quiet. The only downside is if you like swimming in the sea, this isn't the time to go as it is red flagged and you can't go in there. The surrounding area doesn't have to much to offer but there is a pharmacy and fruit stall that are easily accessible. We didn't mind as it was a good base to travel from. Galle isn't far and the Madhuri River (for the little islands you can visit via a boat trip). We did do Yala National Park from here but it is literally a full days worth. The locals unfortunately were hit hard by the tsunami and have resorted to pestering you outside the hotel grounds. The beach always has some hawkers floating around which we found uncomfortable but the hotel can't do anything about this. Back to the hotel, the rooms are generous size and cleaned several times a day (we had a deluxe standard) and has a good temp controlled a/c system and the view is brilliant. There several shows during the week which are quite rustic and the music band and violinist aren't bad. If you enjoy sports, there are two decent tennis courts and an ok badminton court (all outside). They have a billiards table which kept us entertained for quite a few evenings! Overall, we loved it and the food and drink was superb. The staff are very friendly and approachable and nothing is too much. We definitely intend to go back.",positive
"We spent 7 days there, the location is amazing, our rooms was on 3rd floor which was perfect. The staff was very friendly, helpful and hardworking (especially through the storm that happened while we were there). Restaurants downstairs are good. I would recommend this hotel for families more than couples. The prices were high compared to the rest of sri lanka, and for a 5 star hotel I would say they can do much better on rooms cleanliness and fighting insects inside them. Overall though, we had a nice experience and I do recommend this hotel for a short relaxing stay.",positive
"We stayed four nights at the of a two week tour of Sri Lanka and loved every minute of it. We had a deluxe room on the 3rd floor that was slightly bigger than other rooms in the same category. The hotel was only half full (October is the low season) so it was fairly quiet and the room rate was very attractive. The staff were fantastic - attentive and helpful, as well as being friendly. We had dinner two nights in the fine dining restaurant - superb food, reasonably priced although like everywhere in Sri Lanka, opening a bottle of wine doubles the bill. There's not much else around the hotel which may be a disadvantage if your staying beyond a full week but I didn't find neighbouring towns particularly appealing and rather enjoyed the reclusiveness.",positive
"The hotel has an excellent view on the ocean along with the 2 pool facilities with nice beach, the rooms are spacious with good size of bathrooms and other facilities such as the free internet services. The main issue with the Heritance is the Restaurants, the hotel needs to have a compete refurbishment of the main restaurant with better ventilation systems since it has unpleasant smell and this shocked us when we entered the restaurant. Also they need to have more options of restaurants there is only 2 main dining areas. Overall rating good.",positive
We stayed one night hotel and there is only special thing is cultural mask dance show. we enjoyed the show as well as others. you will not enjoy as other heritance hotels. hotel is definitely will need improvement lot. will see next visit,positive
One of the best I can rank when it comes to food. Friendly atmosphere. Friendly staff. Cozy rooms. One thing that I like is the cinneman fragrence in the rooms. Not so happy about the location as there was nothing much to do. Otherwise all was good.,positive
"We stayed here as part of a tour of Sri Lanka, finishing with a 5 night stay by the beach. Positives: the staff are friendly and try very hard. Food was plentiful and usually of good quality. The pools are very pleasant and well set out. The size of the room was good, and the aircon worked well without being too noisy. Drinks were reaonably priced - large beer £1.20, cocktail typically £3.75. Negatives: the building is over thirty years old and doesn't really look as though it has had a proper makeover at any time. It looks a bit tired. Although the staff try hard, they are bit chaotic and prone to mistakes when it is busy. On arrival, the wrong bags were sent to our room, and despite me making this clear, the porter seemed determined to leave them with me - a minor gripe, but typifies things. Drinks and food orders were wrong on occasions. I think that the food was pricey for Sri Lanka at £20 each for food from the buffet. Food at the buffet was not always piping hot, depending on what time we went. There is almost nothing to do outside the hotel. The ""entertainment"" in the evening is dire.",neutral
that is really the best hotel in my whole packege for my honeymoon in Sri Lanka .. Thanks a lot for your good services and kind dealing with us .. I wloud like to visit your hotel again and again ... Thanks a lot Rakan,positive
"From most of the reviews here and because of the generally good reputation of Heritance hotels we had high expectations for our stay here. This was the last part of our Sri Lankan trip before returning to Colombo and the plan was to relax and enjoy a luxury hotel along a beautiful beach. The beach was beautiful but the hotel was disappointing. Pros: -Beautiful beach-clean, not crowded. -Decently appointed room with large balcony. -Wifi that worked well. -Lovely reception area and infinity pool. Cons: -Room floor was sandy, bathroom mats with dirt smudges. -Bad housekeeping service. After being out all morning our room still wasn't cleaned - I called and asked to have it done right away while we were at lunch. They finally arrived while we were napping three hours later. -Broken minibar never repaired or replaced, after we requested -Breakfast buffet restaurant -Very strong moldy/mildewy smell permeates. Buffet adequate but not great. Chaotic atmosphere and spotty-to-bad service. -Hall noise (many children in hotel during our stay) -Noise from pool area - music at night, exercise activity in pool mid-morning Altogether there were too many things wrong with this stay. Disappointing for what is touted as a five star hotel. We would not return or recommend.",negative
"The Heritance Ahungalla so amazing can't wait to go back. The staff were fantastic and they really provided a great service .The hotel is in a great location and our room had a beautiful view of the sea. Food was also lovely and they had plenty of choice. I would highly recommend this hotel it was above expectation, can't wait to go back!",positive
"This was our First personal Trip to Heritance Ahungalle and starting from the Reception to the Restaurant everyone was so pleasant and help full and everyone enjoyed including the kids who stayed at Heritance Ahungalle. We enjoyed all meals and every meal my family members commented on the food so much including the restaurant staff, who was so willingly to assist the kids and even my old father was well attended. We intend visiting again and thank you so much for giving us a memorable holiday",positive
"Fantastic hotel overall, great location, super friendly and helpful staff, excellent quality and choice of food. Nice having a choice of pools and very picturesque setting with sea views from poolside. Hotel rooms were vert spacious and nice decor. Overall an incredible stay, 6 days wasn't long enough!",positive
"As a frequent traveler, it's important for me to comment when a vacation has really exceeded my expectations. Having visited Sri Lanka for the 1st time for a week & staying at Heritance Ahungalla made me realise what great teamwork looks like. Working in a Service industry myself , I tend to be extremely aware of what I expect as well as what great service looks like. The staff were very friendly , professional & accommodating - always smiling & willing to please. They all worked together to make the holiday fun & enjoyable for the guests. We thoroughly enjoyed the dining which was full of variety as well as the evening entertainment where there were live bands or dance shows. Hotel , although very big , was clean & tidy. I have already spoken to my friends & family about visiting in 2014 - Will definitely include Heritance Ahungalla as I loved the Hotel as well as Sri Lanka - People are just amazing! Thank you guys for making it special for us & yes , keep room 306 ready for me in 2014!",positive
"Traveled: Oct 2013 With: Family (spouse + kid 9 yrs) Stayed: 2 nights Pros: Excellent place for a family to stay and visit the south coast of SL. Coastal destinations are a short drive away (~ 50 km). Staff were most courteous and very professional. We were lucky to avail an online offer (Stay 2 Pay 1 for Foreigners). Travelers are highly recommended to check the hotel webpage as well before finalizing an internet booking. The staff who handled our check-in (Vilma) was patient enough to shows us a choice of 2 rooms (our request) before we selected the one we liked best. We surely appreciate the gesture. The pool was superb. The views were great. Room (incl the bathroom) was clean and neat. Breakfast was very complete and tasteful. Daniel's Pub (near the entrance of the hotel - not connected with the hotel) seems to be a moderate place for guys/men (read ""not family w/ kids"") to stop for a quick drink/meal. There are one or two grocery stores within walking distance to buy bare necessities. There are no decent restaurants in the vicinity. Nearest towns are Balpitiya or Ambalangoda (10 to 20 km). Again, if you are visiting Heritance, then plan to spend most of your time in the hotel including meals. Travelers are advised to go with triple occupancy or extra beds for the child/kids since the double bed will not be adequate even for small children. Extra fee is charged, but nominal and complimentary breakfast is included (B&B basis). Concerns: 1. The beach strip beyond the pool is, at times, frequented by local touts who are quite insistent on interrupting the guests' time by accosting them for the river safari (other tours like coral reef and whale watching were not possible due to the rough seas), asking the guests for phone numbers, trying to corner them for an appointment (or sort of promise). They would hang around to check if the guests were returning later to try again. Although this may partly be beyond the hotel's control, some effort can be exercised by the management to preserve the guests' privacy and leisure. I admit that I did not report this ""at that time"" to the management since the Hotel Security was very much on the beach and a mute spectator. 2. Beyond the pool and carrom, there are no activities for kids. The library does not have kids books/magazines. A play area and a moderate level of kid-centric activities would help young couples with children in a very big way.",positive
"Heritance Ahungalla is a resort that is very well maintained, there is no noise from the road, and is set right on the beach. Many rooms have great ocean views. The pool is large with plenty of lounges and umbrellas (attendants supply towels, drinks, etc as desired). 3 or 4 cafe / restaurants exist on site but the quality and variety for the food provided with the accommodation / meal deals was quite good. Balinese Spa was very good quality with reasonable rates. We stayed for 4 nights in a room on level 3. The room was large, well appointed with a good size balcony. Bathroom was large with a rain shower but no bath. TV had plenty of channels, 6/7 in English. Room had both aircon and a fan. No iron in room but was supplied by housekeeping when requested. We stayed for 4 nights ( but wished for more). The stand out though was the staff. All very friendly, professional and more than willing to help one learn the basics of Sinhalese. The stand out though was Anushka. Wherever she was working (Check-in, the restaurant, pool bar) she did a great job with a smile. Will book here next time!",positive
This was my second time stay @ Heritance Ahungalla in sri lanka. As a sri Lankan I'm amazed with the true sri lankan hospitality with Heritance Hotel. The experience I had with the stay and the service level I received from the hotel staff was amazing. keep the same spirit and I'm gonna visit the place soon. Thanks n Best Regards /// Nilan Palihawadana Proprietor Daffodil Travels & Tours,positive
Simply loved our stay in this hotel! Great friendly staff great food! I love the pool and we were welcomed in a very exceptional manner! The room was very comfortable and the privacy given was excellent! The sea view was astonishing and the sea was nice and clean! Superb spot for honeymooners!,positive
"It was two nights staying at Heritance Ahungalla with my family. Actually It was our annual office trip. big crowd visited to Hotel, But they accommodate well. Atmosphere was really cool and carm. Beach was really good, we played both days evening on beach. Fireworks at night was amazing. it was unique to Heritance Ahungalla. They welcome kids well. we had a birthday party for 3 years boy and they organize everything well and has a magic session for all kids and all enjoyed. Foods were really good and no any bad comments on it. Staff were very friendly. Only thing one lady at the restaurant door asking the room number from all people in. it was unpleasant. We visited to Madugaga River safari Trip on same Holiday. Hotel arranged everything for us.",positive
I visited this hotel in The first week of Oct this year (2013). I must say that this was one of the BEST hotels I have visited in the recent years. I was with my family ( wife and three kids ). The service was fantastic. The staff were so friendly and obliging. They make you feel like you are their only priority. Lots to do in the hotel and the surrounding areas. A must visit place if you are planning a trip down south. Great value for money and five stars all around....,positive
"We only spent two night here but this is a place where you could go for your whole holiday. In a large tourist area with plenty to see and do around the local area. Beach is stunning. pools are very inviting, room was large and well furnished. buffet meals are extensive with plenty of choice too. this may be a little bithigher priced than all the other Hotels we stayed in, but the quality is significantly higher too.",positive
From first arriving at the hotel we were greeted with friendly faces and the staff could not have been more helpful. The food was first class and although some of the bedroom furniture probably needed replacing the beds were very comfortable and clean as was the whole of the hotel. Our room overlooked the sea and was very pleasant.Although the hotel is in a small village getting around was no problem with either the hotel taxis or the local tuk-tuks which are outside the hotel gate.We used the same tuk-tuk the whole time and we were taken to some lovely places we would never have found on our own. We would certainly have no reason not to recommend it. The evening entertainment on some of the nights was quite spectacular with the mask dancers and also a show in the pool.,neutral
"We have travelled to many countries and stayed in many Five Star properties for holidays / business trips. There is nothing that can match the breath-taking beauty of Heritance Ahungalla, the scenic beauty and the perfection of the interiors. And no other team can match the finest hospitality & care that we experienced from the team at The Heritance Ahungalla. From the front desk team to the Managers, every single person on the team went the extra mile to make us feel comfortable. Being hard core vegetarians, we had preference which they matched beyond expectation and we have carried back some very special memories of our holiday in Srilanka, thanks to The Heritance Ahungalla. Truly a memorable trip with my father who is 83years old",positive
"I consider Heritance Ahungalle the best hotel in the Aitken Spence Group and have tried to stay here at least once a year for the last 10 years or so. Indika is great at allocatng rooms, and never fails to give us an extremely comfortable room depending on our requirement. The restaurant staff are very attentive, and always gave us a good table in the dining room during our most recent vacation which was from the 4th to the 6th of October 2013. I must make special mention of Thushara and Nelka, who were very attentive at the dining room. The few issues we had were promptly rectified by the staff, so we had a wonderful vacation at Heritance Ahungalle, as always. The hotel staff are extremely friendly and attentive to every need. As for the food, they had everything one could ever wish for. I would recommend this hotel to any one looking out for a really great holiday by the beach.",positive
"We stayed for two weeks at the end of September after the hotel was highly recommended to us by a friend. From the moment we arrived we were treated to a true five star experience. Our room was a deluxe room overlooking the Green Pool with a view of the sea and we couldn't have asked for better. The bathroom had double sinks and the bed was better than our one at home. The buffet food was always fresh and inspiring and the chefs would always cook some plain chicken for my fussy 6 year old daughter. The restaurant staff, even when really busy, were always smiling and attentive. We were especially impressed by KK (Kumara) who went out of his way to make our family holiday incredible. He is a credit to the hotel as well as his colleague Thusara, who also looked after us. The bar staff were great, as were the canapés served with our delicious arrack. The pools were lovely to swim in, especially the Green Pool. We would thoroughly recommend this hotel, even though it's large it has the personal feel of a smaller hotel. It's also worth mentioning that we booked the hotel with Imthiyaz at Sun City Travels in Colombo and he got us a very good rate for our stay. We would like to thank all the staff for their fantastic efforts in making our holiday so amazing. My daughter says she would give the hotel 10 stars if she was allowed. We look forward to returning in 2014. Hector, Maria and Kandy Baker.",neutral
If you want a large hotel with conference facilities this would be a good choice. However if you want a 5 star luxury hotel look elsewhere. The hotel is noisy the rooms decidedly past their use by date. The location is a problem with limited local facilities. Taking a walk was a hassle both on the beach and in the village. The main buffet restaurant is extremely tired. The one saving grace are the staff who are really excellent.,negative
"We only stayed one night in 2 rooms occupying 4 adults and 2 children, but enjoyed our stay fully. Few problems such as insufficient lighting (just one bright light would do to be able to read comfortably) would have been better while some precaution against mosquitoes (although air conditioned) would have been helpful. The toilet was leaking and needs repair or attention in Room 132. It would have been better to indicate clearly as to how to use the radio, control the A/C fan speed or the temperature and other technical items which was lacking. I had some problem in booking the hotel initially since the telephones were not answered promptly and had to ring 3 times and took about 20 minutes to get a positive response. May be because, it is connected to the Head Office and then transferred and therefore with no one to take responsibility. Also, after the booking, when I tried to contact the hotel directly, the immediate response was that ""we are fully booked"" even without knowing what the prospective customer needed to know. Hence, definitely they need some coaching in answering the phones and be able to give some friendly and supportive responses. You may ask why am I explaining all these. That was due to a friendly relationship I had with one of your Managing Directors who brought me to this hotel about 20 years ago. He has passed away now. May God Bless him! Also, during the check out, I was given an invoice without any consideration to the deposit (50%) I made, although it was corrected immediately after pointing it out. These things should never happen if the systems are perfect and the staff are properly trained. This is me stating as a ISO consultant who is conversant with customer care and satisfying their needs while improving efficiency and closing loop holes. However, the staff were excellent and were helpful and anticipated the customer requirements in a positive manner and the busy bodied staff in the restaurant was a site to see. The environs by the side of the blue sea was beautiful with the view of the pool in the foreground that blended graciously with the palm trees around. Ahungalla Heritance is a place that I would recommend without any hesitation, barring a few but vital improvements that are needed.",positive
"Excellent stay ,Excellent food & service by all thank you to the GM & the RM of the hotel & all associates who helped up keep up the good work & the food was fantastic two nice pools my kids loved it & also the room was very good / welcome was unique nice welcome drinks (with a sri Lankan touch )",positive
"My stay was for three nights on a corporate conference. The location and facilities were great. Amazing variety of good food. The staff were well trained and must commend their attentiveness. They were willling to go out of their way to assist guests. The room lights felt somewhat dim, not enought tto dampen the overall great experience though!",positive
"Stayed for 2 weeks for rest and relaxation and got just that! What an amazing place, had a lovely ocean front room, staff couldn't be more helpful and the pool was lovely. Cannot praise the staff enough, we didn't even have to ask what drinks we wanted after a few days as they just looked at us and remembered. The pool boys were great, would get your beds and umbrella ready for you in the morning without even asking, and the residence pool was great, so warm. The food was lovely, lots of variety in both the buffet restaurant and the mustard coffee shop. Highly recommended A+++++++",positive
"As soon as you walk in to this hotel, it's clear it's been uniquely designed with nature in mind. The whole hotel has a strange feeling of being 'outside' and blending in to its surroundings. Wherever you are in the building you can still hear the crashing waves on the beach outside. The room and furnishings were lovely as was the bathroom and shower. Everything spotlessly clean. The breakfast was ok as was the buffet dinner. But we did find there was a slightly strange 'musty' smell in the dining room. We actually thought the dinner at the 'Mustard Restaurant' was better - the rice and curry was wonderful. The outstanding feature of this hotel was without a doubt the pool and the way it blends almost imperceptibly in to the beach behind. Just beautiful. I think more should be done about the touts on the beach who try and sell boat trips and other things in the area. I understand they have to make a living, but they gather near the pool and beach area all day and swarm upon you as soon as you make a move on to the sand. It's just a bit irritating. Other than that, beautiful hotel and beautiful surroundings.",positive
"The hotel is well laid out on a gorgeous stretch of beach and has a couple of great pools in the grounds. I think the best of the hotel is outside as the rooms and corridors while laid out well are in need of upgrading. The sea was very rough but it was stormy when we were in Sri Lanka (end Oct/early Nov). It is a large hotel and the restaurant needs to cater to that so I appreciate that they have volume and varied tastes to deal with but while I enjoyed the stay I was glad not to be staying longer than a few days as the buffet style was repetitive and not the highest standard. The staff were very helpful and welcoming, there are some lovely outdoor bar areas to relax in the evening. On choosing the hotel to start our stay in SL this didnt stand out as being particularly cheap so we chose it on location and the pictures/reviews but I didnt think it stood out and wouldnt go back if I returned to SL.",positive
"We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights, the rooms are lovely with nice balconies overlooking the ocean. There are 2 pools which are both very big and relaxing. Very nice, open plan restaurants and bar areas.The views of the surrounding gardens and ocean is lovely. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. The food in the restaurants was great and very well priced. There was a mix up with the Spa and we had our appointments cancelled 30 minutes before they were booked so we were disappointed by that. However, everything else about the hotel is great. It took us 4 hours driving from Colombo airport but the location is good. Close to turtle hatchery and mangroves boat ride which were well worth the visit. Highly recommended.",positive
"We stayed 4 nights at this hotel, and I want to commend the staff for their excellent service and they made the stay a very pleasant experience.Keep up the good work! It would be good if half-board included the a la carte restaurants because a guest staying for several nights can get a bit bored of the buffet after a few nights.",positive
"I have been to Heritance Ahungalla many many times. It is a second home to my family and my first choice for a family holiday, for an office trip or for a corporate training event. The difference at Heritance Ahungalla is the consistency in service and the courtesy and assistance extended by all, from the GM to a steward or housekeeping staff. Very innovative in everything they do, excellent rooms and delightful cuisine. I will never forget the 'ice-cream sandwich' served after an outdoor training session I had Heritance. The welcome and the departure is equally warm, which is not common - Gihan Talgodapitiya",positive
"We stayed for nine nights, and we were sad to leave. The staff are all very attentive, positive and pleasant. The rooms are o.k., better than expected but could do with freshening up - appreciate that this in not easy in such a tough climate. The two pools are excellent, and probably the main attraction. I didn't think the food was great, but I never like buffet meals and catering for big numbers has its challenges. But we ate out every night, after a curry in the coffee bar on the first night which was disappointingly luke-warm (literally). We played tennis every day, but were the only ones inclined to do that. The courts aren't great, and reflect the occasional tattiness starting to creep in in places. But, overall, it was good value and an enjoyable experience.",positive
"Staff was very attentive and proactive, keep that up. Not seen that lately in a hotel down south. Reckon the rooms need some attention. The AC switch was defective, and few others. Hope the hotel does something about it",neutral
"This mu first visit of down south hotels vacation but the second time of Aitken Spence hotels. (i stay at Hiltop)Seems the hotel location fantastic and environment was good. Reception was not very good as we had to wait more at the the front on my vehicle because less of your drivers which is cause a vehicle ques. Reception ladies good and they are pleasant to visitors. Swimming pool good but they are not providing mat and swimming towels when we went there. I inquired but the workers not provided specially for locals seems they are more focusing on foreigners. Food - Not quite goods/taste may be your staff forcussing on foreigners. Direction not clear - Restaurants, Spa Rooms, Gym etc. Not path direction given when coming out form rooms. Rooms - I stayed Deluxe room seems the private balcony was dirty, chairs, table and chair mats not cleaned. Water bottle provided for room are not enough because they are small ones. Restaurant Service also not quite goods as we have to move our palates beside to have next meal according to your course menu. They more focusing on foreigners not locals. Spa- Need brief introduction of Spa and massage, i was planned to have but due lack information i gave up. Better have induction for locals how, when, where, who is doing.(develop a interest) Finally when i am seen the hotels through the web thought it will be fantastic one but it was not there when i came in. my aim to develop you all to serve better in future not to make complain against you all. Have a great businesses.",neutral
"swimming pool- heritance got two great swimming pools.one at the main entrance,and the other pool on the right side of the hotel.main entrance pool ideal for kids..2nd pool call green pool ideal for adults.. Restaurant and meals- superb and a perfect resto,,meals were excellent we had our breakfast lunch and dinner,,it was a perfect mix of food and deserts. Rooms- great rooms with lcds..top class washrooms..i think every room has nice sceneries... staff- Friendly people from the top to bottom..had a great time @heritance ahungalle keep it up...",positive
"Service and ambiance is superb, i like the subdued architecture and setting. Except for a minor intrusion by a hotel staff when he accidentally entered my room without knocking for housekeeping purposes (since I might not be able to hang the ""do not disturb"" sign on the door knob), everything went well as planned. When it comes to food, a staff should have been present to inform the diners which of the dish is spicy or not (due to health restrictions), but overall the banquet food affords the hotel guest a wide array of dishes to choose from.",positive
"Stayed 2 nights. Wonderful hotel, with great food and a relaxing spa. Very hospitable staff, helpful & always with a smile. Although you are inside the building its like living outdoors with so many court yards , trees, water pools inside the hotel....Could hear the sound of the sea while in the room.... The massage at the spa is worth the price... Would certainly visit again.... Overall had a wonderful stay.",positive
We have stayed in another heritance hotel before in Kandalama and refreshingly the branding was held through by this equally pleasant hotel by the beach. We had unfortunately to cut our stay short but the Front Office Manager Indika Gonawela was very accommodating and helpful and the staff as a whole were friendly and thoughtful throughout our stay,positive
A hotel that has an impeccable service and warmth about it. From the time you enter to the time you leave the staff will make you feel so at home. Filled with smiles and excellent service 24/7. A wonderful atmosphere with an infinity pool to die for. However i would like to give some constuctive feedback to the hotel management with regard to food. As a five star resort i expected the food on weekdays to be what i would say awesome. But i was disappointed to see the buffet was average. It didnt make me say wow and the dishes were predictable each time i came to the buffet as i stayed 3 nights. I was surprised to hear the hotel has an award winning chef. However it did not reflect so with the cuisine. The silver food containers were very hard to open and close. The buffet should be more colorful and the dessert needs to have variety as i have experienced in other five star hotels in sri lanka. The hotel didnt have a tea/coffee buffet for the evening tea. (As advised by the staff when inquired). Other hotels provide these services for full board guests. The tea in the room is not that pleasant due to the creamer tasting weird with tea. So they need to have a tea corner as well. Next time i return to the hotel i wish see this as a five star hotel to its fullest and not only to the star count. Dinuk Weerasekara (Sri Lanka),neutral
"I stayed in Heritance for for three days and it was a pleasant experience, Though I am a Sri Lankan I had the opportunity to taste the best Sri Lankan style food. Staff of the hotel were very friendly and extremely helpful.Hope I recommend Heritance to anyone who wish to spend their holiday in beach side, in Sri Lanka.",positive
"I booked three rooms at half-board and came with my wife, 20 month old daughter and wife's relatives for two nights in September 2013. I was keen to experience a Geoffrey Bawa architected hotel and was impressed by the thoughtfulness of his design. The hotel aims to merge with nature, and allow for breezes to flow throughout the compound, providing a natural cooling. There were two pools, which we well maintained and a great place to lounge through during the day. I was very keen to experience the food at the hotel - as I had heard that it was rated as one of the best dining resorts in Sri Lanka and I was not disappointed. I was struck by the thoughtfulness of the dishes in the Jute restaurant - and also couldn't recall any dish tasting bad. All the food was balanced and tasty. Even the Sri Lankan food was unbelievably good. The staff were helpful and always with a smile. Also enjoyed the gym, badmington court and table tennis facility in the venue. The only negative for me was the reasonable isolation of the resort. As I tend to always like to explore the surroundings, I was a bit disappointed when leaving the resort by the lack of facilities around walking distance of the hotel. Again that was my preference, but if you wish to travel and only stay in a resort to rest and relax it is a great place.",positive
"The hotel was right on the beach, gated and setback from the main street.with numerous restaurants to choose from. We found the coffee shop lobster more superior to the fine dining restaurant experience. Great buffet breakfast-try the hoppers. The gym was the only disappointment with 2 walking machines and one permanently broken. Pools were great but ocean too wild to swim due to monsoon rains that came and went. The spa was average-reasonable prices but service disappointing. We went to the turtle farm nearby and other day trips are possible. If this is your last night I would suggest going further towards Colombo and staying at Mt Lavinia Hotel which is closer to the airport.",neutral
"We stayed here for 4 nights and had a great time. The resort is very large and has many amenities (swimming pool, tennis, table tennis, pool table) on offer to keep guests entertained. The entrance to the resort is probably the highlight of the place with the large infinity pool sitting in front of the open plan reception facing the sea. Both pools in the resort are great and very relaxing. The beach is also lovely although the water in September is too rough to swim in. The only downside to the beach is the constant group of locals setting up camp on the edge of the resort grounds and pestering every guest who ventures on to the beach. Surely there's a more effective way to sell goods/tours to guests than annoying every one of them when they pass a certain point. The rooms are nice with large comfortable beds and decent en-suites with a great shower. Our only complaint here is that everything in the room was quite damp. The bed, the pillows, our clothes... I don't think much can be done about this though as my guess is that it's down to the time of year and the sea air. The food was hit and miss. We had the buffet on one of the evenings which was decent although very pricey at Rs 3,300. We had one in the Cinnamon Grand in Colombo a few nights later which was only Rs 2,600 and was of far higher quality. The a-la-carte menu also left a bit to be desired and at times worked out quite expensive for the quality when the service charge and taxes were factored in. The breakfast was a plus point though with the freshly made waffles a particular highlight. We found the staff here very friendly and helpful and felt that they certainly made our stay here as enjoyable as possible.",positive
"Resort location is awesome. I was just speechless after I entered the resort. What a view of the ocean straight from the swimming pool. Hats off to the architect of this resort !!!! Also the amenities in the bathroom were excellent (specially shower gel) which i have never seen in any 5 star hotel. It was totally a wonderful and memorable experience for me. Food need to be improved for Indian people specially. Indian chef must be there otherwise everything is up to the mark. Congrates :) Hiren +919624045777 Skyline Tours, Surat, India",positive

"We were looking for the finest destination for our annual branch outing and the Heritance Ahungalle was named by most of the colleagues . It was a really amazing one night stay by the sea and among the spectacular architectural designs of the world renowned Mr.Jeffry Bawa.

At the same time I thank Mr Indika the front office manager,the animators and the staff for their excellent service.",positive
"we did not technically stay at this hotel as the hotel authorities had messed up our booking and had to re-accomodate us with some other properties. they did make up for their mistakes with a few upgrades and free food and wine thrown in, no worries. the reason for this review is the time we spent at the swimming pool side - the awesome pool view and location that this place has! infinity pools should look like this...very nice! also - a word for the staff...though they had messed up the bookings, they did try to make amends as best as possible with the re-booking at a resort in Hikkaduwa and also free lunch and dinner thrown in with some bottles of wine.",positive

"My sister and I were really looking forward to ending our 9 day tour of Sri Lanka in an excellent 5 star hotel. To our dismay, we were presented by a hotel which should not be claiming it's 5 star label. A three star at best. It was by no means dirty, but very rough around the edges. It was in dire need of renovation. The room itself had nothing wrong with it, but no determining feature to tout it as a 5 star resort. The food was ok. Unfortunately, it was a big anticlimax for the end of our trip.",neutral

"Luxurious hotel on the sea front. We spent the last 2 days of our holiday here and found it a very good location from which to visit Galle, and other coastal attractions such as the turtle hatchery at Kosgoda, the mask museum at Ambalangoda and the Madu River mangrove cruise. The hotel has 2 large attractive swimming pools set in well looked after gardens. The rooms were spacious and clean and there was always a good choice of food in the buffet restaurant. Best of all, the staff were very friendly and helpful - always smiling. Tennis, badminton and table tennis were available. Beware the hawkers on the beach who are very persistent.",positive

We stayed at the hotel from 27th to 29th August 2013 on full board basis with three families occupying 4 rooms. on arrival the GM upgraded one room into a suite due to previous relationships. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful.The food was excellent. The restaurant staff was constantly inquiring too our well-being looking into children's tastes. The children were enjoying the outdoor activities such as badminton/Tennis Table tennis.Since the pool and the beach are situated close to each other it was really fun to enjoy the evening running from one to another. We are very thankful to the GM and the entire hotel staff for providing us a memorable holiday for our 3 families,positive
"The hotel was quite good and I enjoyed my stay there. The staff were very friendly and the hotel was clean and well organized. I especially liked the swimming pool area facing the beach. Although, there were a couple of things that could be improved. For one thing, the rooms me and my family stayed in had a few maintenance issues (the ac was not working properly for one of the rooms and the shower drain was clogged). The food in the hotel was good but not nothing special compared to other hotels I've visited in Sri Lanka. Another thing that was lacking were the sports and recreation facilities. All in all, it was a nice stay but I definitely would not rate it as one of the best hotels I've stayed in in Sri Lanka.",positive
"We had 2 days relaxing by the sea after a tour of Sri Lanka. The hotel is fairly large, but clean and well organized. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The food was good and fairly hot in the buffet restaurant. It was mainly Sri Lankan dishes. There are several swimming pools and right on the edge of the beach. The sea was very rough, but there was plenty of room to swim in the pools.",positive
"Lovely views towards the sea. Buffet restaurant very suitable for families but coffee shop very very good for couples. Also a fine dining restaurant. Friendly efficient staff. We were upgraded on arrival due to celebrating an anniversary. Had better room which was very large and looked out onto residents pool. Pool boys very efficient and friendly, putting out beds and towels each morning.",positive
"We stayed 1st to 10th August all inclusive. We had a fantastic and relaxing time during our stay. The hotel itself is clean and well maintained. The people who clean the rooms leave some nice touches such as petals on the beds and animals made from towels. The scenery from the lobby and our room (we requested an ocean view) is breathtakingly beautiful. The sea at this time of year is choppy and cannot be entered but this is not a problem with two large, clean swimming pools with pool attendants to provide comfortable sun beds. There is a great selection of gorgeous food and we never once felt hungry! Plenty of facilities and entertainment such as gym, table tennis, tennis courts, spa, pool table, live music and evening entertainment. But what really makes this hotel, is the friendly, hard-working staff who went out of their way to make our stay a memorable one. They couldn't do enough for us. A special mention for Nirosh, Robhana and Sampath (the resident manager) who looked after us so well and Ayesha who made us some fantastic cocktails. Would I return to this hotel? Most definitely! The sooner the better! From Mr Mark and Sarah!",positive
"Hotel is really nice, people are very good. Facilities are really good and comfortable. Location is really amazing. Lot of things are there to do sports, games etc. It'd be much great if some other outdoor activities such as cycling etc. are available. Foods are not so good.",positive
"Heritance Ahungalla is an awesome hotel. When I use the word 'awesome', I am not using this lightly. I stayed at Heritance Ahungalla for 4 nights on my honeymoon and the food was very yammee.. Every time I go to have meals I come out stuffed... hehe.. :) The hospitality of the hotel is very good and the people are very friendly too. Every one working there, even the guy who was painting the hotel, would smile and greet us. The hotel is well maintained and room service is excellent. The view from the lobby is very cool. It's as if, the pool is connected to the ocean. I would recommend this hotel to any one who is planning on going on a holiday down south or on their honeymoon... :)",positive
"We spent 2 night at Heritance recently. It is indeed a memorable visit for us as it was after quite some time we visited down south. This is a hotel we wanted to visit for a long time and August school break provided an ideal opportunity . Why Heritance? Well, it is a generally accepted fact that they serve good food and my previous visit had proved that too. When we checked in I casually mentioned to the reservation executive that it was my daughters birthday (11 Years) and he immediately informed us that he was going to organize a complimentary birthday cake. What was left for us was to decide the size of the cake. So the first day dinner we concluded with the birthday celebration, the staff joining us with cutting the cake and singing happy birthday for my daughter. Such a wonderful moment for three of us. As usual the food was upto the expectations and in many varieties too. Different themes every day/every meal time and plenty of options for everybody, including enough varieties of sea food, one of my favourites. Rooms are quite clean and tidy and I have no complains. The residence pool was one of my favourites places. This is ideal for a quiet evening swimming. Don't forget to dip in the Jacuzzi near the residence pool if you happen to visit the hotel.Badminton and Tennis as well the Gym Table will burn your extra fat intake, if you are concern about your health during your stay. The most striking feature of the hotel for me is their friendliness. Everybody is willing to spent at least one or two minutes talking to you and is also willing to assist you in whatever manner possible. On improvements, I guess the gardening and landscaping has been somewhat neglected. Heritance Ahungalla, you could definitely do a better job than this.",positive
"We had excellent stay in Heritance Ahungulla with the family, room, service and food was very good, children enjoyed swimming pool very much. Also we want to share very good experience with our driver Hiran Rangana (www.Ipalanka.com) he spend with us almost two weeks and we are very lucky to get such a nice and friendly man as our driver. He knows the country very well and is very selflessly helpful (he shared his experiences and recommended us to visit some places which all of us enjoyed very much), also helped to negotiated the prices or made arrangement by himself on our behalf in order to minimize the costs. God bless him :)",positive
"It was a family trip and we thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of this trip.The staff are very helpful,courteous and kind and go all the way out to be hospitable.We would definetely like to visit again and enjoy the experience.It has been a totally memorable trip from the welcome we got when we arrived to the goodbyes when we left.I want to thank each and every member of the staff in all the departments for their service and i guess its one of a kind hotel where everyone works from the heart and it makes a huge difference for guests.Keep up the good work!Best wishes!",positive
"i was at the hotel afew days ago with colleagues for a workshop. The location is well located. Staff were also pleasant and of help while needed. My main disapointment was the rooms. As i was taking a shower, water didnt run through the drain as fast as its supposed to. This was a clear indication that the drainage is poor. Also, i noticed a dry roll of tissue placed on top of the septic tank, Yak! I immediately threw the tissue in the bin.The walls of the bathroom are not very clean. I would suggest that they invest in putting tiles on the wall. The sheets were also not sparkling clean. One had a stain of something......i dont know what. The towels are also not new. I had one tired look towel which they tried to hide with the newer towel. The hotel needs to really look into the small things that give guests total satisfaction. Otherwise, i dont think i would want to go back there in the near future.",negative
"It is a nice hotel. i have been to this hotel a few times long ago. this was the most recent visit. The staff is really good,friendly and attentive. They had a large range of drinks for the breakfast. With two swimming pools you have choice. the DJ at the club was playing really good music but it was totally empty because nobody is aware of the club. The room condition is average.",positive
"Spent 3 nights here after touring the cultural triangle. Pros * Excellent service and friendly staff who arranged transport to other nearby areas. * Large, quiet swimming pool. * High quality rooms - we were upgrade to a suite at no extra charge - this had a huge bathroom and seating area as well as all the usual amenities: mini bar, hair drier, safe etc. * The breakfast buffet has a wide range of local and western choices available until 11am. Cons * The sellers on the beach are NON STOP which made it nearly impossible to enjoy a walk along the beautiful beach - even sitting by the pool if you look up and catch their eye they shout over for about 10 minutes. * We relented to one of the hawkers and agreed to go to his restaurant down the beach for dinner but although it looked beautiful with fairy lights and candles, 2 of our party were violently ill after eating seafood here. * The hotel is away from everything else so it's not easy to get to alternatives for dinner etc. we got a cab to Galle which is beautiful and has many restaurant choices - I would stay in Galle if I went to this area again.",positive
"We stayed at the Heritance Ahungalla for 4 nights in August 2013 at the end of a 2 week visit to Sri Lanka. The Heritage Ahungalla is the only hotel where we experienced poor service and poor housekeeping and felt that the hotel did not live up to its literature (website). Things started badly and unfortunately certainly did not improve. On arrival only some of our party of 5 were offered hospitality and this itself was done unsatisfactorily, being given before the hand towels were provided. A small blip but, as it turned out, indicative of what was to follow. The check-in process was acceptable, slightly slow but not beyond what was reasonable. The assistant (off his own back) confirmed that my wife and I would be in one room and our 3 children in another room (as we had booked). We were then shown to our two “luxury” rooms. The children were allocated an incredibly large room with a double bed for the girls to share (not uncommon in Sri Lanka) and a separate bed for our son. No complaints there. My wife and I were then taken to our room. This was approximately half the size, and had twin beds pushed together to resemble a double bed – with a double bed headboard and the top blanket pulled across the pair – but there were undeniably two separate beds. It was hard to believe that the two rooms were of the same category. It was also perplexing that the hotel had designated the rooms as they had and, most of all, astonishing that they had not put my wife and me in the room with the double bed (the other room was still plenty large enough to accommodate the children). We raised the matter at reception but were told that nothing could be done; no double bedded room was available for us. The only thing the hotel suggested was that we could swap rooms but by that time everyone had unpacked and settled in and (quite apart from the obvious inconvenience entailed) this reversal would hardly have gone down well with the children whose expectations had been raised by what the hotel had given them in the first place. Dinner: Unlike everywhere else we stayed, the main restaurant (the Jute) did not offer an a la carte dining option, only a buffet, although the in-room literature (itself in a ragged state) indicated it did. To rub salt into the wound, the buffet was very expensively priced compared with the other comparable hotels we stayed in. It then emerged that the policy on what rate to charge for children was seemingly wholly arbitrary and depended on whether one asked about it. The default position was a full/adult charge but when this was queried a concession was immediately made for the children, this being apparently down to the attitude of the particular manager in question. We chose to dine in the Mustard Coffee Shop (a much smaller establishment) where one can purchase individual dishes. The food was acceptable but of a distinctly lower quality than we had enjoyed elsewhere. Breakfast: This (included in our package) was provided in the main restaurant. The food was ok and there was a fairly good selection. However, the service was undoubtedly by far the worst we experienced during our holiday. Quite simply, there appeared to be too few waiters. It often took quite some effort to order tea and to have dirty plates etc. removed – in marked contrast with the attentive service consistently shown at other hotels. Also, it appeared that the hotel provided breakfast for substantial numbers of non-residents (attending conferences etc.); this made the restaurant particularly busy and not the place for a restful, relaxing meal. Housekeeping: A joke. Our room had not been properly cleaned on arrival; there was sand all over the towel hook. We had to call twice to have it seen to. Our request that a blown light bulb be replaced was never met. The second day was ok. However, on the third day housekeeping did not come to either room. It took 3 calls from us to get them to clean the rooms – which they did eventually in the late afternoon. Further, they failed to leave any bottles of water in the children’s room, even though they had done so the previous day and despite the fact that on the same occasion they left fresh water in our room. When our daughters asked for a supply for them (to brush their teeth etc.) they were told that water was only provided free-of-charge for the first night and that thereafter it must be purchased. This was a clear fob-off (inconsistent with and contradicted by the hotel’s own actions on other days and in relation to our room). It took intervention from my wife to get this issue resolved. Down the corridor some other guests had spilled fruit over the floor. Housekeeping, along with a trolley of cleaning materials, passed by the scene but failed to clear it properly. Eventually we asked for it to be cleaned. When we left there were still watermelon seeds on the (sticky) floor. Pools: The main pool (featured on the website) is open to non-resident guests and can become very busy, meaning that in effect you feel confined to using the second pool. Check out: We had to leave at 4.30 a.m. to catch our flight. I told the hotel this and settled our account around 10 p.m. on the final evening. The hotel thus knew our plans. At 4.30 the following morning we all trooped to reception with our cases and I handed in our keys. It was clear to the staff that we were leaving then. We waited in front of the desk with our cases for our taxi to arrive. There was no sign of it; the forecourt was empty and there was no vehicle visible. After 10 minutes or so my wife asked the reception to telephone the taxi company for us. Only then did the staff inform us that the taxi had actually arrived some time ago and was parked in a dark corner with all its lights and engine off! Why they did not volunteer the information before is a total mystery. It was sheer good luck that we asked them to make the call for us (rather than trying to call the tour company ourselves); otherwise we could have been waiting at reception indefinitely, oblivious of the fact that the taxi was just some yards away! Indeed, when we were on the road the taxi driver told us that due to some confusion (for which the hotel was not responsible) he’d been booked to arrive at 2 a.m. On arrival – having entered via the security-controlled gates – he had told the staff. Why they had not seen fit to call us in our room to notify us is again utterly inexplicable. It is just typical of the absence of service we experienced throughout our stay. All in all: the Heritance Ahungalla should be avoided. It is very much the weak link in the Heritance chain (we stayed at Heritance hotels in Kandamala and Nuwara Eliya which were both good). By all means visit Sri Lanka – but I strongly suggest you find somewhere else to stay.",positive
"This hotel was recommended to us by people who stayed here 4 years ago as 'best hotel in SL'. Unfortunately the hotel did not live up to expectations of 'best hotel' or even a 5 star hotel. The upkeep of the hotel is very poor. I understand the humidity and moisture in the air would make it difficult to maintain but the other hotels are managing to maintain standard. Firstly the rooms are looking tired and old!! -The bathrooms were filthy!! i asked house keeping to re clean!! Shower screens had mould and l was told this is hard to keep clean! - what a load of rubbish!! - Beds had bed bugs in them, we were bitten so badly and i thought this was odd as we have been traveling around SL for 2 weeks and not one mozzie bite throughout the whole trip! -Cockroaches in the bathroom after dark! - Complex too large (may be a positive for some people) - Main dining room dark and mouldy smelly + The positives are the staff!! Always friendly and very eager to help. When i complained about the first room we were moved immediately + house keeping really tried to clean the room upon complaint Needless to say as this was the part of our trip to relax we moved hotels and could not have been happier. If this hotel was rated down then i would not have written a review like this but this is definitely not a 5 star hotel",negative
It's charming!I love the green view and the fresh air.The staff is very nice.The time is too short to stay here.I wish that I could be Heritance Ahungalla.Thanks for your service.I have a nice holiday in Srilanka!,positive
"If you are looking for a hotel in which to relax and unwind after a hectic tour of Sri Lanka then this hotel will fit the bill.As you can see from my profile I do not do reviews and use trip advisor to get an idea of what to book based on other peoples experiences. However I feel that after staying at this hotel for 7 nights I should write a review. The arrival and check-in went very smoothly and we were taken to our room without delay. I had booked a 'de luxe ocean view' room and this is what we got with a view over the main pool and expansive view of the sea. The room was bright and airy with plenty of space. The air conditioning worked well with some minor adjustment for our own tastes. The house keeping of the room could not have been better with some very artistic towel creations every night! The main dining room offered buffet style eating which was always of a high quality with a choice of local or European style foods. I prefer a quiet pool to swim in and relax by and the smaller pool was perfect for this. There was never a problem with pool loungers and after chat with the pool attendant the loungers can be arranged for the following day (no getting up early with towels) what makes this hotel special is the staff. From the beaming smile of the lady as you enter the restaurant to the bar staff at the pool bar, they are all trying to make sure you are happy and enjoying the experience. They take an interest in where you come from and will sort out any special requests. I let it slip that it was our wedding anniversary and a special cake was presented to us after our evening meal. The only downside to staying at this hotel is, as mentioned by other reviewers, the problem of the hawkers on the beach. They can be intimidating but a firm no and not making eye contact seemed to work and we were not bothered again as we walked along the beach All in all a wonderful stay and we would certainly return.",positive
"Overall a very good hotel and staff were excellent. Some areas of the hotel were tired but everywhere was very clean. Rooms were comfortable and facilities good, with a reasonably well equipped gym and two large pool areas, where the attendants were helpful in providing towels and arranging beds. The food was very good however, our experience in the dining room was mixed, mainly because at the weekend, the hotel is open to non-residents, so there were suddenly huge numbers of extra diners for dinner on Saturday and breakfast on Sunday, which turned the experience into a bit of a bun fight. The quality of the food was still good, however the presentation was off putting as staff could not keep up with the volume and serving dishes were left messy and tables were not cleared as quickly as on other days. We ended up in the 'outside area' which felt very 'make shift' - perhaps this area should be made available for non residents so that residents at the hotel do not experience reduced standards at the weekend. On the plus side, there is a quieter residents only pool, so it is possible to escape during the day at the weekend. My advice would be to avoid weekends when the hotel is open to non-residents as it becomes far too busy and noisy, specifically in the dining area.",positive
"The hotel is generally good. I was informed that it had been hit by the tsunami in 2004 and all the ground floor rooms were submerged. I travelled in a group and somehow got upgraded to a large deluxe room which was fantastics with all the trimmings. The room was spacious with a great view. However, my friends who were in standards rooms didn't like their stay at all. They complained about the rooms having flying cockroaches. The culinary experience was not as great as I hoped considering the hotel was voted as being the Best in Culinary Experience in Sri Lanka. Maybe because I was comparing with Hilton Colombo where I had just come from and which I would rate as better. The gym was ok but the electic equipment such as treadmills and cross trainers could use an upgrade. The gym is open throughout i.e. it's never locked which is great for flexibility. The swimming pools are very inviting and the meeting room were provided was ok though the selection of coffee/ tea beak snacks could be improved. One thing that was interesting was the sea was rough all the time throughout our stay. No guests could swim in the sea at all. This is a very interesting phenomenon which i had not previously experienced.",neutral
my overall stay was very good.. staff was friendly n helping.... breakfast was amazing... view was breath taking.... we were able to listen the sound of waves all the time which was very soothing and relaxing.. the only thing which was not impressive at all was the lighting of the hotel... not only rooms but outside the room with in the premises of hotel... rooms need to be more lighted.. and i didn't get the reason behind switching off all lights ... not even a single bulb around the entire hotel .. which makes the hotel looks like a haunted place in the late hours... at least a lil bit of light should be there so that it becomes easier to reach to the room in late hours... other then lighting everything was good.....,positive
My husband and I have just spent a week at the Heritance Ahungalla. The hotel it's self is very tired and needs a full refurb this is mostly evident in the main dinning resturant and pool side. The hotel needs to deal with the beach traders who make it very difficult to take a walk along the beach. With regard to the staff this was by far the redeeming aspect of our trip as every member of staff we dealt with we're exceptional. The food also cooked by the chefs in the fine dinning was also second to none and you would find it hard to eat a more tender fillet steak or rack of lamb.,neutral
"The Hotel is amazing and I agree with all the reviews but the Main Restaurant was over priced compared to other 4/5 star hotels in Sri Lanka, Please consider reviewing your prices vs service and quality. E.g. 600 rupees +++ for simple juices like Pineapple/Lime/Papaya, For the same price you can get cocktails at Galle Face Hotel.",positive
"A beautiful vacation well spent in a fantastic hotel, the driveway into the lobby from the main gate itself gives you an idea that you are surely in for lots of surprises. A spacious lobby followed by a large swimming pool extending into the beach takes your breath away. A huge five star heritage hotel with most warm staff ever experienced. An elaborate buffet for each meal awaited us for an entire week and none of the cuisine was repeated, the desserts were to die for. Savoured king coconut water in plenty. Swimming pools, tennis courts, table tennis, spa, live music, art shops, bar, library all adds to the zing that you want for your comfort away from home. Keep it up, will highly recommend for all and any,",positive
"Our vacation to the South has always been at Heritance Ahungalla or Triton as known in the past. Thought of having a change this time and checked into another 5 Star Resort Hotel in Beruwela. Never felt comfortable from the time we stepped into thier lobby although it was a hotel built long after Triton and refurbished very recently. So the same evening made reservation at Heritace Ahungalla and shifted the following day, which was only a 15 minutes drive.",positive
"I got married at this hotel on 12th April this year. I have to say from the moment we arrived we were looked after. I must say a big thank you to the Guest Relations Executive - Thilini, she made sure our big day went by stress free. As a bride there were a few things I was worried about but I had no need to be at all. The flowers, cake and everything were perfect. We had friends join us at the hotel throughout the holiday and they too were welcomed. We had arranged dinner on the beach on the evening of the wedding, the service was faultless. We sat down to eat later than the scheduled time due to a rain shower but it was no problem at all. Whenever we were ready, the staff were ready. The staff always had a smile even after working long days continuously. I would recommend to anyone to stay here and I will always have fond memories of Sri Lanka and the Heritance Ahungalla. The GM of the hotel Refhan was always around and visible, he introduced himself to us before our wedding day. The facilities are spotless, the buffet selection is good and the al a carte restaurants also great. I cannot fault this hotel at all. Thank you again to all the staff who made our stay memorable.",positive
"I have been going to this hotel for the past 25 years + and have always enjoyed my stay there. The staff are friendly and very helpful, rooms clean and comfortable and the food very delicious and a great choice at every meal. It is a five star hotel with a six star service. Certainly recommend a stay here when visiting the south cast of Sri Lanka",positive
"We stayed at this hotel for 10 nights on full board basis. The design of this hotel is magnificent, with great attention to detail. The amenities are amazing. We would especially like to mention the animators who kept us all busy with water polo, table tennis, boules, volleyball, the evening shows etc. The staff were very friendly and helpful, nothing was too much for them. The food at breakfast, lunch and dinner was outstanding and the variety amazing. We will definitely be returning to this hotel next year for two weeks!!",negative
"We loved our three days, the breach boarders the hotel. Clean air and quiet. We had full buffet and enjoyed the fresh food. We have now stayed here three times and enjoy the self contained convenience. The highway makes the hotel within two hours range of Colombo. Our only challenge was finding the hotel from the highway.",positive
"We were only able to stay one night, however it was fantastic. The hotel staff were extremely attentive and thoughtful in securing us a room as close to the lift as possible to suit our special needs. The room itself was large and spacious with a lovely view overlooking the beach. We spent most of our time by the pool which is gorgeous, right by the beach! The food was really great and the restaurant staff very friendly. We had a lovely time at this hotel, it has a great atmosphere!",positive
"I have been to this hotel once before and it has managed to exceed my expectations. Great Service and Brilliant Staff, A family friendly atmosphere. Reasonable variation in cuisine to suit all flavor palates. Loved the location, excellent place to get away from your busy life.",positive
"Excellent in terms of facilities, nice pool, excellent play ground to play cricket. The games were arranged in short notice. Friendly staff and the level of service is above the expected level. But the variety of Foods for Lunch and Dinner were not up to standard. Needs more variety specially for lunch and dinner",positive
"This Hotel has won awards for its cooking particularly pastries so the croissants are outstanding. My room was delightful and well serviced. Everyone in our group had a wonderful 2 days there. I am concerned however at the long hours the staff are working. If you look carefully you will see the same people at 10pm as at 8am and that is too long a shift. I was a little puzzled too by the inconsistency of the pool attendant at the pool that non residents can visit as I was quizzed over my costume which had a floaty bit of material on it and had to prove it was part of the costume yet when a school party arrived they were playing a ball game in clothes-tee shirts and shorts, in the pool-very definitely not costumes or pool attire. Fortunately there is another pool just for residents where you could go for a quieter swim where the attendant was much nicer and more helpful. I found that every time I went to the beach people approached you and it got so difficult I stopped going as it became uncomfortable. This would put me off any lengthy stay here.",positive
We stayed two nights and it was fabulous. We had our meals in the main dinning room both days and I must mention one particular staff member mr Dayal De Silva from the restaurant he anticipated guest needs and reacted quickly. I was talking to my wife about having a good cup of tea and mr De Silava heard us and he offers us tea. However I must mention that during our stay choice of food is very limited in the buffet. First night they had Srilankan night and the second night they had Indian night both night choice of food is limited. Service levels are inconsistance to locals and foreigners should be given equal treatment. I never received a call from the guest relations team to find out about our stay or what could have been done to make our stay memorable.However I got a call from the head office Mr Upendra Serisena sking how my stay and what can be done to make our stay memorable. I think that was a very nice touch on his part and kudos to Mr Serisena. Guest of room 325 & 253 Abeykoon family,positive

"Our vacation was made more memorable by the excellent service and hospitality extended by the management and staff at the Heritance Ahungalla.

"We returned to Heritance after 23 years ..... In the early '90's we would drive down twice a month. We were apprehensive when we decided to take our teenage daughter to experience what we had loved so much about this resort. It is with great appreciation to the welcome of the staff, that we realised that everything was in immaculate condition, the pool, the rooms, and the food was as we remembered, delicious. Our stay was wonderful,we enjoyed each day and we will return again. Thank you !",positive
"Ideal vacation spot for the traveller who loves the beach combined with the comfort, luxury and fantastic service of this star class resort. 2 fantastic pools especially the one reserved only for in house guests are a fantastic form of relaxation as well as recreation.

"We felt totally great in such a refreshing place among a very special ambiance for relaxation. However you have to bear in mind that this time period provokes a quite rough sea where it was not allowed to swim. The food was perfect with a great variety of choices and show cooking. In particular the luxury room went far beyond our expectations. Special thank goes to our pool waiter ""Senarath"" who provided excellent service to us.",positive
We arrived at Heritance Ahungalla and immediately relaxed. We arrived early but we were immediately welcomed and every effort was made to get our rooms ready as quickly as possible. The swimming pools are definitely the highlight and sitting by the pool drinking a cocktail before dinner was so relaxing. Checkout time of 12 noon gives you the chance of making the most of your stay.,positive
Brilliant food and excellent service as expected. Lots of fun activities for kids. Fire show was great. Very obliging and caring staff. Great music by the band on Saturday night. A good base to explore the southern city of Galle with its Dutch fort or for an expedition on the river. The sea is quite rough but the clean wide beach almost compensates for not being able take a dip in the ocean.,positive
"Customer service is excellent. and there is a huge pool. Saturdays and Sundays are great. The food, the service, the staff, the room, everything was perfect. There is no point in describing it all. One must experience it. it's the best place I've ever been and I simply can not wait to go back.",positive
"I had my first visit to Hertance with my family, it was our office trip. The rooms are above average, but food and other restaurant services were not great. Most of my family are vegetarian, all vegetarians had the same food experience as we had. Dinner had a BBQ and some dishes, but lack of tasty vegetarian food, they should have at least added some Indian food items. I hope they will seriously look into this. Thanx Anura",neutral

"This is a truly lovely resort hotel with a stunning design, making the most of a beautiful location. We stayed here for our final two days after a fascinating but exhausting tour of the island and it provided the ideal retreat for rest and relaxation! From the warm welcome with refreshing cold towels and a choice of juices to the moment we regretfully left for the airport, all the staff seemed to go out of their way to make our stay a memorable one. Our luxury room on the third floor had a stylish bathroom and lovely outlook over one of the pools to the ocean beyond. Staff who serviced the rooms were not only efficient but added an element of fun by leaving a different 'animal' sculpted from a towel on the bed each evening! We stayed for three nights and dined in a different location on each. On the first night 'The Mustard Cafe' suited our needs as after a tiring day we just needed refuelling before bed. The international menu featuring pasta, burgers, etc..was functional and service was friendly and efficient. However the atmosphere was a little 'soulless'. The buffet on the second night in the main restaurant was again 'functional'. It was certainly not the worst buffet we had encountered during the holiday but neither was it the best and the vast room again lacked atmosphere. Our third night however was very special. Due to a problem with the air con in the Fine Dining A la Carte restaurant we were offered the option of dining on the beach. This was truly magical. Our party of 6 were the only ones eating on the beach that night and to be served freshly caught lobster and other delicacies with silver service and flickering lanterns to the sound of the waves and a distant Kandyan drummer was a memory that will long live on. Apart from trips on the Manu river and to the turtle hatchery at Kasgoda, there is little in the immediate vicinity of the hotel to tempt one out. We could not swim in the sea due to the strong currents at this time of year but the beach was spectacular to walk on and we did not witness undue amounts of litter as a previous reviewer encountered. As for the 'hawkers', they were only present in small numbers and were genial and never threatening - all adding to the local colour! There is also a small fish restaurant a few hundred yards along the beach to the right of the hotel (little more than a shack) which provided a pleasant alternative venue for lunch. Meanwhile, back at the hotel, if one tired of lazing by one of the beautiful pools (in the company of two resident monitor lizards!) the 'animators' were on hand to organise an impromptu volleyball tournament for those teens and twenties with more energy than their parents! This hotel is another example of the Aitken Spence Group at its best. I have rated it as 4 rather than 5 stars simply because we were lucky enough to have stayed at The Heritance Kandalama and Heritance Tea Factory ( all in the same group). Their unique locations and innovative design led me to award them the extra star but for a beach resort The Ahungalla would be hard to beat!",positive
"The beginning of the holiday started in a very disappointing way. We arrived at the hotel at 2PM on time for check in. However we were informed that the rooms were not ready. As a result we had to wait for over two and a half hours to get our rooms which was a very disappointing experience to start a vacation. The excuse given by the staff was that the guests have not vacated the rooms on time. This is not a plausible excuse. The hotel should know when to call and inform guests that they need to check out on time. The least they could do then is call us and let us know there is a delay so that we can plan to arrive late to the hotel. My mother who is elderly had to sit for along time in the reception area and found it difficult to walk afterwords as well. We actually decided never to come back to this hotel again but we changed our minds after the experience afterwards. The staff in the hotel mainly the room maintenance and restaurant staff were very polite friendly and courteous. Never before had we experienced such a good service from staff in any other hotels we had been to. Another plus point was the food. The food was excellent. There was a wide variety and it was very tasty. One negative aspect is that we stayed one night on a day where there were less guests. On this day the food variety was not there and that was a bit of a undermining experience for us. Another unsatisfactory experience I faced was with the pool attendant. When I went to the swimming pool I asked the pool attendant for a towel. His reply was that the hotel had instructed him to inform guests to bring their room towels. This seemed very odd to me as I saw other patrons having pool towels. Anyway I proceeded to have a swim and I could not dry myself as I had no towel and I had to go to the room all wet. With the cold wind blowing I could have got pneumonia as well but thankfully that didn't happen. Later on I called the reception to clarify this and they said that the pool attendant should have given me towels and that he had given me false information. In any case I do hope the hotel takes this experience as a learning and inform their pool attendants as to not to refuse to give patrons pool towels. Finally I would like to say that the hotel did allow us to have a late check out in order to compensate for the delayed check in. Overall I would say that I would come back to Heritance Ahungalla due to the friendly and polite staff and the good food. However I hope that I will not face the unpleasent expeirnces I mentioned above, the next time I visit.. Dilshan Thambawita",negative
"The rooms are spacious, clean, with everything you need. The staff was always friendly and helpfull. There are many facilities (2 swimming pools, badminton, tennis, pingpong, spa, gym) and many are free to use. One minor: There is nothing to do or see in Ahungalla. If you leave the hotel for a walk in the town or on the beach villagers always try to sell you things. This is the case everywhere in Sri Lanka, but it makes you feel trapped (in a golden cage).",positive
"Dear Team at Heritence Ahungalla, More than anything it is the service that i admire most... Simply great service! From the Porter to the GM all had one thing in mind which is how to make the customer happy. Constructive feedback for the team from us is that, rooms need to be decorated with more paintings/hangings, may be a day bed for the suite, couple of easy chairs for the balcony ..etc. (Anyway overall room facilities were very good) I will recommend the hotel to my friends & family and thinking of staying at the hotel again..",positive
"Dear Mr.Refhan & team, I wish to thank you & the team for warm hospitality extended to me & my family during our stay.food & the services are excellent. Staff are always very helpful to us.Hotel is very cleaned too..my family enjoyed their stay even though it was a brief one & eagerly waiting to visit Heritance Ahungalla once again which i too am looking forward to. Thank you very much once again Mr.Refhan for the great hospitality extended which shall be in our minds for many more years.",positive
"Great location; great facilities; fabulous, helpful and friendly staff. The rooms are spacious, nice and very clean. The food was fantastic - especially considering we visited in low season. Do yourself a favour - if you are visiting the southwest - book it!!",positive
Pearson staff spent a really great vacation there in Heritance Ahungalla last weekend. This stay was a really value for money and everybody thoroughly enjoyed every bit of it. The food was great and I really liked the Sunday lunch. Fire show on Saturday night was very innovative and creative which was not a typical fire show that I usually see. Everything else was arranged as per the Pearson staff expectations and there was nothing to complain. I must specially thank the Hotel staff being so friendly and helpful not only during our stay but also helping to get this trip arranged. Special thanks should go to Sampath (RM) and Indika (FOM) and Deshan. I have been to quite a few star class resorts but Heritance Ahungalla is really a star among other resorts and it is the hotel staff that made it. I would highly recommend this place for anyone who wish to spend their vacation. Good job Heritance and wish you success!,positive
"Very very very excellent hotel; Shashi and wasitha are very friendly and kind people in hotel especially shashi animation .nice rooms,nice beach,nice pools.thank you reception workers are very good one advice:all facilities must be free of charge because it's a five stars hotel",positive
"apart from the great food and beautiful place, the best part about this hotel is its service. the staff are polite, kind and very alert. they made our stay so much better. we were with a 1 1/2yr baby, and they made sure she was made special meals. loved the place!! highly recommend it to anyone!!",positive
"My family stayed here, attending a beautiful wedding ceremony. Our two kids loved the spacious pool and the food. The staff were very kind and alert to our needs. The hotel was quick in contacting a doctor for us when one of the kids fell ill, this always being a concern when you travel. Make sure you ask the staff to spray your room for Mosquitos.",positive
"Lovely looking hotel with a beautiful location. A few irritations though - no soap in the rooms, just two empty soap boxes in the bathroom bin! The boutique appeared to have exactly what I was looking for, but despite three trips to the shop and finding the ""open"" sign in the window, the door was locked and nobody was there. As we had to depart, I didn't have time to try to find someone. On arrival we had to remind the reception staff to give us back our passports. And there was extraordinarily loud drumming below our room for perhaps 45 minutes after dinner! We presumed there must have been some sort of cultural show on that we hadn't been told about. We were just starting to get really tired of it when it stopped. We had dinner in our room, and it was served quite promptly and was delicious. Breakfast was also delicious, with a great variety. Despite this list of irritations, the hotel was quite lovely, and if we had been staying longer, we would have taken the trouble to sort them out.",neutral
"We attended a wedding at Heritance Ahungalla and stayed for four nights. The staff was very service minded, kind to our kids and intend on giving us the best possible experience on our stay. Our two small boys really enjoyed the pools and catching crabs on the beach with the help of the friendly guards seated at the hotel perimeter. The breakfast buffet was good and overwhelming in choice. Lunch at the pool bar is recommendable and the eating options (different restaurants) are generally very good. However, we tried the Mustard restaurant twice but were not so impressed with the meals here.",positive
"We stayed here for a four night beach stay to end our tour of Sri Lanka. The hotel is in a nice location next to the beach. It has two pools, one near the main foyer and another one in a quieter spot - you can't see the beach from this pool but it is nicer and used more than the other one. We checked in on a Sunday afternoon - although it is low season, during the weekends the hotel is still fully booked due to package specials. This meant the reception was very busy when we got in and may be why we were allocated a poor standard room initially. It was dirty and had an overpowering musty smell - we were very disappointed, but fortunately after a few hours we were able to go in a much nicer room without the smell and a good view over looking the ocean. We generally felt that our stay here was below the quality of stays we have had a similar resorts. Some staff went out of their way to make sure our stay was enjoyable, but then some staff were not as accommodating. For example there are hawkers from the beach that come up in to the resort, so that when we were relaxing they would be yelling out to us to buy their wares - there is a security guard there so it is hard to believe they are even allowed to do this. We were even more shocked when one of the pool attendants actually encouraged us to buy a shirt from one of them! The beach is not actually very nice to spend time on due to a lot of rubbish washed up on the shore. We stayed on a half board basis so ate at the hotel a lot and the quality of the meals was a bit inconsistent. The first night dinner buffet was very limited so we asked to have a la carte and this was kindly provided. The next night, there were so few guests that a special a la carte menu was offered - we had a seafood dish and wow - it was literally the best meal we had during our whole Sri Lankan holiday! Then we had a great buffet one night with lots of beautiful hot and fresh food. We also ordered lunches and the menu was quite limited - again we had some great dishes and some that were a little disappointing.",positive
We attended a wedding at Heritance Ahungalla and stayed for five nights. It was a great stay. The hotel staff was very serviceminded and the hotel facilities are great. Our kids especially enjoyed the two very large pools.,positive
"We were staying there at the New Year 2012/2013. In real, we didnt choose this hotel, it had choosen us)) of the mistake in booking of our touroperator. Some persons of staff were very polient and helpful. Breakfast could be more various and tasteful, I think. Prices for dinners were too high and we didnt take it. Nice beach, but there are a lot of local people, who always wanted you to buy something. Somebody of them could be really crazy, so please, dont walking alone by yourself at the beach. Rooms are nice, but it needed renovation in parts. There are not directly view at the ocean, but in the garden there are a lot of funny animals. Probably for somebody it is nice place, but I am nor sure that we would like to return there again.",neutral
"One of the most beautiful hotels in Sri Lanka (we've stayed in 6 different ones on our trip). The grounds are wonderful, gorgeous pools with beautifully kept landscaping, very friendly staff, great food although the breakfast area can be a bit messy on the weekend, but their chocolate croissants are the best we've had in Sri Lanka. The cereal display could use some organizing (bowls were missing). The chef was very kind and accomodating as I was craving mangoes and he kindly sent over a big plate of mango slices although it wasn't offered at the breakfast buffet! The restaurant staff was always smiling and ready to assist you. We were upgraded to an incredible suite on the second floor due to a reservation problem, and it seriously made our stay even more enjoyable. Comfort, luxury, and relaxation at their finest! The hotel has a very well equipped gym that overlooks the pool area and the gardens. Unfortunately, we didn't get to play tennis although we really wanted to (lack of time), nor play table tennis and pool, but if you're looking for entertainment and/or activities to do while you're at the hotel, you won't be disappointed :-) Try the a la carte restaurant outside near the main pool; the food is excellent. Very reasonable prices although a cappucino and a latte at the main lobby were a bit overpriced. It was a shame that we couldn't swim due to the red flag, but I can't wait to return during the swimming season to make the most of that amazing hotel. Overall, a fantastic experience. Thank you Heritance Ahungalla, you made it much more difficult to leave Sri Lanka!",positive
"My wife and I wanted to have a beach wedding in Sri Lanka and we were looking for a great place to host our wedding. We had guests from all over the world, US, Denmark, Sweden, Australia, Dubai, Germany, Kenya and last but not least Sri Lanka (about 80 guests). So we were looking for a place large enough to accommodate our guests and have a wonderful experience, not just for us but for all our guests as well. Then we came across Heritance Ahungalla and we are so very delighted to pick Heritance Ahungalla to have our wedding. From the start, the staff at the hotel was very helpful and accommodating, and offered suggestions to make our event wonderful. The booking of the hotel for all our guests went very smoothly and Front Office manager Nihal from reservation department handled all the reservations with extreme professionalism. At the front lobby Thilini welcomed all of our guests and made sure that they are well taken care of. As for the wedding, let me start out by saying that everything went exactly the way we had hoped. We had the master of the ceremony provided by the hotel and also hotel staff was kind enough to provide us the best scenic location for poruwa (Sri Lankan traditional marriage stage). We felt like the whole staff at the hotel was part of our wedding, felt almost like a one big family. Food and Beverage manager Gamini Wijetunga was excellent and extremely helpful in planning the event from the start, offering suggestions to make our event very unique. He made things very easy for us. Most importantly, Gamini and the rest of the staff are extremely professional and honest. General Manager Refhan Razeen was also very kind and made sure to accommodate all our requests. More so, we felt that he really cared for all our guests. Food and beverage executive Dilum Samarasinghe was always in the main restaurant making sure that the guests were happy with their meals. He always had a very pleasant smile, and very helpful with planning the event as well. The hotel is simply beautiful and the pool/beach location was the perfect scene for the traditional Porowa ceremony. We were concerned about the weather and possible rain but whole staff at the hotel was very kind enough and went out of their way to offer optional areas to have the reception. Drinks and food was delicious and served with great timing. Our guests (Sri Lanka, Europe, US, Aus.) stayed for several days and had a wonderful time, not just with the wedding but also relaxing by the pool, touring nearby sights etc. Second pool at the side of the hotel was excellent as well. Pool boys were very nice and always around the pool area to offer towels etc… In room dining was also excellent and gave us a good service. Apart from the wedding ceremony during our 5 days at Heritance we experienced a good variety of food at the buffet, with good Sri Lankan and Western options. Apart from the main dining restaurant, the bar café and the À la Carte restaurant had excellent food as well. We would highly recommend Heritance Ahungalla to anybody looking for a beach hotel and beach wedding in Sri Lanka. All members of the staff (restaurants, reception, pool, room service etc) were very helpful and always had a smile on their face. We want to thank them all for making our special day just perfect! My wife and I, all of our friends, and family had a great experience and cannot wait to visit Heritance Ahungalla next year!",positive
"Excellent food selection and taste also good.service was good and was very friendly. When we were there,large group were there which came on annual trip.hence during lunch time restaurant was not enough and was felt cramped up.however staff did their best to cater, it's up to the management to up grade the dining area or have special arrangements for large groups like that. Other than that overall I am impressed",positive
Everything was o k except for few service setbacks in some areas. But my concern is that the food quality and selection . it didn't stand out despite having the most awarded celebrity chef. The hotel must be careful in selecting the range if foods that compliment each other and food taste was of average quality. When the hotel is championing their chefs individual brilliance they must make sure same is trickled down across the board,neutral
"Although we went in low season, the staff were excellent, very welcoming and the service was flawless. The room was very clean (twice per day) and the facilities were pleasant with their 2 huge pools and easy access to the beach. The restaurant was good but the menu A La Carte a little bit limited. The breakfast was good with a great variety of foods. We really enjoyed our stay there and we strongly recommend this hotel.",positive
We stayed there for one night. Room was clean and big. The food was nothing great. it was all ordinary stuff and not much variety. There are 2 big pools and the beach was nice. The water aerobic sessions were interesting. Staff were friendly.,neutral
"Large (i mean LARGE) hotel, feels like you are among thousands of rooms, room slightly shabby (cvery 1970s India ashoka hotel type), ordinary food... the sort you would expect package tourists to come in droves. the redeeming feature is the pool and the beach right on the property, where you could escape, as you could to a hundred places on the Galle road... would not recommend when there are a thousand other options here...",neutral
"My trip was last September and it was an amazing experience with my wife at Heritance Ahungalle. The friendly and welcoming staff escorted us to the lobby and given refreshing drinks while the check in formalities were all taken care by them. I found the architecture of the hotel very interesting especially because every room had a beach view. A photo taken, seated on the “lovers chair” near the main pool overlooking the ocean is a must do. We got the Tendulkar suite. I loved it so much since I’m a very big fan of the little master. The housekeeping and the room facilities were in perfect condition, which also had a private Jacuzzi .The complementary fruit baskets given to us every day added a nice touch. The service standards and attention to details by the staff were excellent. The main restaurant by the poolside each night was themed. The ambiance of the place was very classy and traditional. Both of us enjoyed the food very much which had a very large selection of local and international dishes. At the end of our stay we were taken for a hotel round up and were very impressed on how eco-friendly and efficient the hotel is. Will be back in Sri Lanka this September and hope to repeat this wonderful experience at heritance.",positive
"This was my third visit to Heritance Ahungalla and it's been a wonderful place to be with the family and friends for a holiday out. Warm welcome extended to each and every gust who comes to the hotel by the guest relation executives and personalize service starts from moment you step in till the departure. I was received by the Asst Front Office Manager at the lobby and had a smooth check in process where everything was perfectly arranged. The room was spacious, clean, comfortable and well equipped with all the modern five star facilities. The buffet had a large variety of food and perfectly presented too. Been travelling in Sri Lanka for a long time and nothing can beat the taste of the Heritance Ahungalla food. During my stay, one of my favorite place was the hot water Jacuzzi, which was situated near one of the two outside well maintained swimming pools. Had a nice time with my friends at the hotel's night club which provided the music and the entertainment. Overall, it was another fantastic stay at my favorite hotel and really enjoyed the ""bed tea"" which I got to my door step in the morning.",positive

"Its my fifth time in Heritance and the standards continue. They have a good selection on dinning, though the dessert range seem to have come down a bit. The Fire dance entertainment is a bit of a joke. We Sri Lankans can never do it like the Africans. We rather do what we are good at like a Low-country mask dance, would have certainly thrilled the visitors than the ""Fire Dance"". Such dance would have even entertained the Local crowd as well as the foreigners. Parking lot for the residents can improve. Big hump (almost not visible) on the entrance gate brushed up in to my chassis of my new 2013 year car ! Wish that did not happen. Also the parking area is full of grass. They have Baby/Kids care facillity. Had we known before, we would have been prepared to get use of it.",neutral
The stay in the Heritance Ahungalla is a wonderful experience. The food was fabulous & live cooking is also very interesting. Nice Spicy srilankan dishes to tickle the appetite.

"It was a full moon day and although cloudy, we were able to see glimpses of silvery moonlight shining on the sea and glitter of stars scattered over the sky. We opted for fine dining and were treated for a delicious lobster dish with wine and a wonderful dessert. The suite we occupied was well appointed and comfortable with all one can ask for, away from home. We particularly liked the solid wood furniture.As expected the staff was courteous, efficient and well trained, one can see. We received more than we bargained for.",positive
"My parents and I, together with two friends spent a wonderful weekend at this lovely beach resort last week. The hotel is a 5 star beach resort which belongs to Aitken Spence Hotels group and situated by the sea with a beautiful garden and two spacious swimming pools. The rooms are spacious, very clean and comfortable with room balconies overlooking the sea. The service we received from the entire hotel staff was absolutely amazing. From the time of checking in to the final goodbye, they were very friendly and efficient!! A special thank you to Nilanga (Ms), Indika, Dinusha, Nihal, Sunethra (Ms), Gamini, Thushara and the rest of the wonderful staff at the hotel. Food was very tasty & fresh and a huge variety with dishes to suit all tastes. We enjoyed all three meals on buffet and evening entertainment was great too. They had a live band playing at the Lobby and a separate Night Club with DJ for the young crowd. It was happening :) Overall, we had an awesome stay at Heritance Ahugalla and we love to come back there!!",positive
Excellent hotel to relax and spend quality with friends! the staff is very helpful and the food was excellent.We played some beach cricket and the swimming pool was cool :).we got triple rooms which were Ok for three people.,positive
The staff are very friendly and helpful. The food is excellent for the weekend buffet. The rooms are clean and comfortable. If the rooms are refurbished with more modern furniture and interior I would rate overall excellent. But overall it's real value for money.,positive
"As you come in through to the hotel, the view is just awesome. Can see through the lobby straight into the pool and the ocean. This first view is what sets the experience for your stay. Rooms were great, we got a double room,... but we ended up in something of a suite. Lots of space and great amenities. Food was good too, quite a big selection. Very friendly staff, really enjoyed our stay.",positive

Excellent hotel to relax and spend quality time with family & friends! the staff is very helpful and will go out of their way to make you feel at home.. we were really surprised to see the Residence Manager Sampath De Silva in almost the same attire as the staff walking around and talking to the guest unlike in other hotels were the snr managers tend to sit in their room in suit and wait for guest to approach them!

We would like to specially thank Dinusha, Sampath, Dilum, Thushara, Gonawela and Mr.Razeen.",positive
It is a really friendly and helpful place I have ever been. Hotel staff is helping their guest out of the way if there is a need. Food is really good and large varieties. They have two big swimming pools and both are very clean and nicely maintain. The hotel is gifted with such a beautiful stretch of sea beach. One of the best sea beach location in Sri Lanka (although not recommended to have sea bath in off-season) The best place to have dinner at beach with your loved ones or friends. I should never forget Indika ( Front office manager) who is a real asset to the hotel with good PR and well knowledge about the other location to visit. I am sure that he will always there to help you with his very friendly staff .,positive

"I had my best holiday at Heritance Ahungalla last week. It has the best beach and scenic view from each room. We stayed in tendulkar suite which carries memories of tendulkar and remarkable room on his stay. Which has spacious living room, bed room, jaccuzi, home theatre system with 32 "" led etc.... Mr. Indika (front office manager) was veryhelpful on our hospitality during our stay and he is easily accessible throut the day at lobby with his presence. Mr kumara (food and beverages) manager who catered us with some personalized menu to our table. I had the best sea food mix devilled dish which was sweet and sour served to our table though there is a buffet goin on. The buffet spread was awesome with some action station and variety of world class menu planned by world famous celebrity chef mr. Dimuthu. No words to say about the chocolate mousse and other desserts served Our bed tea was served on time to our room. Rooms are well neat and tidy. Hotel staffs from porters to top managment was very helpful. Remarkable thing is their smile and helpful courtesy carried out from bottom to top staffs ( from porters till managers) We would like to wish to have another holiday at this resort. I wud suggest heritance ahungalla for all trip advisor users that there is no any other reosrts in beach could cater you like ahungalla as i have travelled many hotels in southern costal Wish you all the very best",positive
"Another very enjoyable stay at the Heritance Ahungalla-or, as I still prefer to call it, the `Triton’. The food is very good, thanks to superb chefs such as Chef Dimuthu, and the service and hospitality have always been outstanding-largely because there are many on the staff, such as Mr Dayal and Mr Jayantha, who have worked at the hotel for years and take great pride in its operation. Management personnel, Mr Indika and Mr Sampath went out of their way to be helpful, as usual. The hotel has a unique and enduring beauty because of its location and the extraordinary architecture, the courtyards and the foliage that are found throughout the hotel-and which make it a nightmare to maintain (especially when it rains-and it poured on this trip, with monsoonal ferocity, giving me a new experience of the hotel) but thankfully that is not the guest’s responsibility, although do be careful with the wet floors. What I particularly appreciate about this hotel are the different and varied areas it offers such as the private pool, the four bars, the library. So there is somewhere to escape even when it is crowded. The hotel provides cultural or musical shows nightly, meetings with the cooks can be arranged apparently, and an evening trip on the nearby river is very enjoyable. But for me the Triton/Heritance is perhaps best for those seeking a holiday `getting away from it all’ rather than those looking for entertainment. I have stayed at this hotel at least once a year for the last eighteen years, and always emerge refreshed and revived. My one reservation on this occasion is that the prices in the coffee shop are exorbitant-more than Rs.600 for a banana milkshake! (In any case, I would recommend the Thambili-King Coconut- which is one of the cheapest and healthiest drinks available. I think it is cheaper than bottled water and it is a good remedy for dehydration).",positive
"We are staying at the Heritance Ahungalla during the monsoon low season, but weather has been great. The hotel is a beautiful Geoffrey Bawa resort, not new but reasonably well maintained. We have a lovely comfortable, well appointed room, spotlessly clean and attended to each day. Beautiful swimming pool (can't swim in the ocean at this time of year as it's too rough). Friendly staff. Great breakfast. So why aren't I giving this resort 5 stars? A few problems. Firstly the service at the outdoor bar area is very slow for simple snacks/ lunch. You wait and wait for a simple sandwich for example. Prices are very high. With tax and service we just paid 2,000 rupee for a bottle of Lion beer, a lime and soda and bowl of devilled cashews. The resort feels a bit isolated and there aren't obvious alternatives for dining etc. (that may explain the high prices.) The resort is large. Next time I will stay in all boutique hotels and guest houses for more personalised service and better value in Sri Lanka. I feel a bit ripped off at this resort (and we have stayed at a range of places around Sri Lanka). Even up market resorts need to understand that there is a limit to what tourists will pay for basics.",positive
"From the initial booking over the phone, staff was very attentive, warm & friendly. this was further proven at the gate, reception,what a courteous welcome. Great experience. specially the serene nature of people, and the environment. Food was plentiful ,varied and delicious particularely the dinner. enoyed the pool side fire work & music. Kids enjoyed the pool and beach. rooms were very clean. so is the room service. value for money. great place for holidaying",positive
"From the moment we approached the hotel and could view the picture-framed sea through the open-air reception area, my wife thought there was something strangely familiar about the place. Of course I insisted that she was wrong until the ever happy to please restaurant manager Kumara Karunaratne, informed us that this used to be the Triton hotel until it was destroyed by the tsunami. We had stayed here 18 years ago! I deservedly lunched on humble-pie that afternoon. Back to the hotel - there is no doubt that most of the staff at the hotel realise that the success of their business is wholely dependant on guest satisfaction and recommendation and none more so than Kumara (aka KK) and his team, who tirelessly greet you with a smile and a 'can do with pleasure attitude' at all times. It is fair to say that the property itself is due for an extensive upgrade and hopefully the new road from the airport, which is due to be completed in 4-6 months will reduce the journey time by half (currently 3hrs) and make this destination even more attractive. The bedrooms are spacious albeit modestly furnished and our interconnecting rooms were perfect for our family of 5. Parents with fussy eating children can relax - nothing is a problem for the kitchen and I am delighted to advise that you get exacty what you've ordered. All in all, we had an excellent time in a paradise-like location with some of the friendliest and most welcoming people you could wish to meet. More importantly, the children loved it despite their revision.",positive
"Great place for a nice relaxing vacation. Great food prepared by the olympic gold medal winning celebrity chef, the facilities and amazingly attentive service. Stay at the Sir Cliff Richards Suite and sleep on the bed he slept whiles listening to his music in the in room CD player. What a treat.",positive
"From the initial approach up the gated drive,the infinity pool in reception,courteous welcome: it only got better.Room was very clean.On ground floor,pool just outside the patio doors.Food was plentiful ,varied and delicious.We always ate outside.Only ever 3 or so couples out there.Attentive service.Cannot compliment the staff more,they were superb.Beach clean and big..Going back to do another tour in 2014.Heritance will be on our return visit list.",neutral
"Great hospitality, friendly staff make home like atmosphere for the guests.This hotel is situated in a beautiful location in the southern coastal line. Room and amenities are nicely arranged for a relaxing stay. Two pools; guests can have a private bath in the green pool or can play water polo in the other pool. Food was delicious! All is well, highly recommended!",positive
"Another relaxing and joyful holiday spent at the Heritance Ahungalla! I've said many times before and i'll say it again the Staff at Heritance Ahungalla make your stay that much better, they are ever willing to help and always with a smile. To me they are benchmark by which I measure all other hotels in Srilanka. Pools, beach and room were excellent as usual",positive
Stayed with family over the 24/26 May long week end. Hotel was packed with more local guests and the staff was making an extra effort to make sure that all guests are comfortable. A notable feature was the smiling faces of the staff. Food was excellent and the service was exemplary. It was a wonderful experience and recommend the hotel with pleasure.,positive
"We went for a long weekend with friends and family, and although I have been to this hotel on at least six different occasions before, and has been one of my favourite hotels in Sri Lanka, my previous visit was several years ago. The location is obviously beautiful with a wide stretch of beach right in front of the hotel, and the two pools (one general, and one only for residents) are set out beautifully. The service too was very good, with all staff members appearing well-trained and professional, while maintaining the warm Sri Lankan hospitality. Unfortunately, our room was not up to the standard we expected, and what we have come to experience on our previous stays. The bathroom had an inexplicable odour and even had cobwebs in some corners, and we found a cockroach as well. Once again, the hotel staff was extremely accommodating and let us change rooms - especially due to the odour, but we happened to find a cockroach in the bathroom of the new room as well. We only had breakfast and dinner buffets at the hotel - the food and spread were average, but not too impressive. The staff once again was very hospitable and accommodating. We hope the management will take necessary measures to maintain this beautiful property, make the buffets more exciting, and bring the hotel back to its former impressive reputation.",positive
"I always visit this hotel with my friends when I have free time. The pool is amazing in the evening with the sea view.All the staff members were very friendly and helpful and gave there best to enjoy our holiday. Food also good with lots of choices to select, and I do not hesitate to recommend this hotel to a friend to stay.",positive
"In this hotel i like the person plays the flute,top of the boat..at night it is just relaxing...food excellent staff excellent,room,atmosphere...some times its bit crowded though its a good getaway from Colombo to spend your long weekend may be with your girl friend..worth it..",positive
"My husband and I received a wedding gift of vouchers for a two night stay at Heritance Ahungalla, we managed to confirm our booking over the Vesak holidays and were delighted with our stay at the hotel. The staff and service were excellent, everyone went out of their way to make us feel comfortable and welcome. The entire vesak programme was very entertaining and showcased Sri Lankan traditions and customs in a very memorable manner, we particularly enjoyed the cultural show featuring masks and dances from various parts of Sri Lanka. A treatment at the Diviyan spa was a worthwhile addition to our stay at the hotel, the treatments are excellent value for money and the ladies at the spa do a great warm stones massage. Although the dining room did tend to get crowded, the spread was varied and tasty- especially the Sunday lunch buffet. I also really loved the fact that I hardly had to ask for my water glass to be refilled as the restaurant staff were so attentive. Overall we enjoyed a very relaxing and memorable getaway at the hotel and would like to commend the staff for their standard of service and hospitality. Mr. and Mrs. Jayamaha",positive
"We stayed at heritance ahungalla with family in May 2013. Our stay was very good all round. Generally a busy and crowded hotel during the weekends.. but still we had personal attention from staff and we didn't have any problems there... reservations - the guy was very helpful and ensured what we requested was reserved for us when we went there. reception - she welcomed us cheerfully and showed to our rooms without any delay in arrival formalities. room - comfortable, clean, good view, good in room facilities such as mini fridge, safety locker etc. clean & functioning bathroom.. food - breakfast was very good.. a lot of variety. dinner was good but mostly vegetarian (we were told that no meat was served due to wesak full moon poya weekend... bad... we had picked the wrong weekend...) staff - friendly & helpful.. ensured our comfort. didn't keep us waiting... billing - they overbilled us but quickly corrected it without any issue or delay once we pointed it out (please check your bills) Overall we enjoyed our stay there.....",positive
"Breeze, sand and sea Relaxing @ Hotel Heritance Ahungalla Nice friendly staff and Great Architecture is the best. Food is average. Clean and good rooms. Two good swimming pools. Yes.. Had a good time with my family.",positive
"At the entrance to the hotel there was a big advertising board claiming to have the best culinary team in the island, since another tourist recommended the food here we booked in for lunch as a special treat. It was a buffet priced at over £27 per couple which is quite expensive compared to normal Sri Lankan standards, considering all the hype we were expecting a grand lunch to remember. We were tempted by the grilled seafood skewers as a starter and this was the beginning of the worst meal in Sri Lanka ever. We could not eat them they were stale and tough as old boots. I decided to go for the main course and on the way noticed to my horror the cause of the awful starters the chef was taking out old cooked seafood skewers from a container and putting them back on the hot grill. The main course did not impress one bit the meat curry was stale and very dry, the vegetables were overcooked. The desserts were awful and the only good thing served here was what they did not prepare themselves"" the curd & honey"". During our meal we requested to see the chef to make a complaint regarding this terrible food. Finally a gentleman appeared at our table who was unable to give us any satisfactory explanation. We ordered coffee and guess what it was stale and lukewarm. By then we were fuming and demanded to see the manager who was very apologetic and requested us to come back that evening for a meal on him, how kind. He even charged us in full for the worst meal we had in Sri Lanka. Do you think we went back that evening for another repeat performance on the house, ""Hell no"". Do not be fooled by false advertising claims when you can get a much better meal from any roadside cafe for less than £8 for two.",negative
"We had an excellent stay.... Even our veg food requirements were personally looked into by Mr.KK the restaurant manager. The resort is excellent, comfortable with a beautiful view of the beach. Strongly recommended.....!!!",positive
"We stayed here for two nights. At first we were given a standard room, but our toilet was not working. So thankfully we were upgraded. After this small hitch, all our tour group was upgraded. This lovely hotel, has two beautiful pools and it is quiet and relaxing. The food at this hotel is also good, the staff are friendly and overall a pleasant stay. However on checkout much confusion with bills being mixed up within our tour group. This took about 45 minutes to sort out and when the cashier was asked for proof of purchase, he had to fish the receipts from the bin. This system needs an overhaul to ensure correct bills are billed to the correct person. Would definitely stay here again.",negative
"it was too crowded, cockroaches in our room, also food was not so impressive and the atmosphere was not good for a relaxing holiday the day we stayed there. Didnt like the bathrooms either. sorry but i think it should be a three star hotel Only good thing was the staff, they were so friendly and helpfull. will I go back , nope.",negative
"My wife and I celebrated our first wedding anniversary at Heritance Ahungalla and I wantto say a big Thank you to all the staff members at Ahungalla Heritance for making our Anniversary a memorable one. From the moment you step into the hotel you will not fail to notice the pleasant genuine smiles of the staff members. From the reception staff, to room service, to the staff at the restaurant to the pool attendants, to the spa girls everyone were very pleasant and friendly. You walk into a five star hotel and the rooms and the food are obviously up to high standards. The pools were very beautiful. The residents pool was even more beautiful. However, the credit needs to go to the all the staff for giving us such a wonderful experience. After all, it's people that make the difference. A very special thank you to Mr Sampath as well. We hope to come again soon. Thank you once again.",positive
"We recently visited Sri Lanka and spent 3 night at Heritance in Ahungalla. One of the best beach properties we have stayed at. The hospitality and the staff are real nice and warm. We got to see the Tendulkar Suite, which is in honor of Sachin Tendulkar. Beautiful swimming pools. They have daily activities conducted by the hotel staff, i.e. Pool Yoga, Kids Face Painting, Water Polo, etc.",positive
"I contacted the hotel & arranged a reservation for my parents & sister to stay at the hotel. A lady from the head office was in contact with my father until the day they arrived. My parents & sister said that the stay was wonderful & truly enjoyable. They specially said that the hotel staff, from the reception, to the restaurant waiters/servers, to the room service attendants were very helpful & always served with a smile. I want to convey their regards & gratitude for your hospitality & for serving with a smile. Keep up the great work. Cheers",positive
"We went for a 2 days stay at heritance last March.The staff were extremely efficient and friendly,which is what we noticed straight away.The refreshing welcome drink and warm towel was indeed exactly what we needed on a sunny March day. Although we had to wait about an hour more we were upgraded to Sir Cliff Richard suite which had both the sea view and pool view. Food was commendable although there wasn't much variety for vegetarians. The beach is just a stones throw away, clean and safe. The hotel had organized some traditional as well as modern performances for earth hour celebrations,which we enjoyed thoroughly. More than anything else the human factor is what we remember most from heritance, as the staff just never failed to greet us with a friendly smile coupled with admirable efficiency. An ideal place to get pampered like a VIP.",positive
"I meant to write this review long time back but a good comment for this absolutely wonderful hotel is never too late. This is the best beach resort in the country in my own opinion and is highly recommended for its wonderful hospitality, atmosphere of the hotel, the two lovely pools, quality of food, friendliness of the staff and the star class facilities in their rooms. They have a vast range of food at the buffets and theme nights for the week including Sri Lanka, BBQ etc. The rooms are very spacious and beautifully decorated. I would go there over and over again and is my favourite beach resort always.",positive
"This was a perfect holiday for us. The staff was excellent, friendly and ready to support us with EVERYTHING. We had great room with a very nice room boy who was making sure everything is in order (twice or more per day!). The hotel is a master piece and perfect in every regard. Lots of respect for the nature. The food was delicious, any special request was accommodated (more/less spicy, something special for baby etc). I've seen wedding arranged by the hotel and was regretting I had not made my mind on time to do the same - very special moment. I hope we will come back there!",positive
I wnet their to celebrate the birthday of my spouse and never regretted my choice. They also arranged a nice surprise for her (upon my request) which was much much more than I had expected for. The location and service is really commendable.,positive

"The hotel location is superb. The entire staff go an extra mile to make your stay wonderful. To be in such a lovely place where the only sound we could hear for a long time from our room, was the sea and the wind through the trees. Will go back hopefully",positive
"Overall, our stay was very good. We enjoyed the hospitality of the staff all the time. They are all blessed with typical Sri Lankan warmth and smile. Room was good but lacked the warmth the staff had. Most disapponting was the tea sachets in the room. I am a tea lover and looked forward to have a nice cup of tea and they had some stassens tea which was simply horrible. There was no taste but it had a dark reddish colour and an aweful smell. I wonder how the tourists felt about that tea and of Sri Lanka being a good qulaity tea provider. I strongly recommend that stassens tea sachets be removed from rooms as soon as possible.",positive
"I was with my relations at Heritance Ahungalla last week. We enjoyed the stay. Very good service from the staff. Some of my relatives did not like to uniform worn by the staff. We stayed one night. There were lot of local and few foreigners, i am sure therefore hotel might have arrange for more local food. If you compare the food with other 5 start hotels in Colombo i think they would have done a better job. We stayed on the 2nd floor rooms. Rooms were really good. Unfortunate thing happened to me first time in my life, i locked the all the doors of the card keeping the key inside, which led the staff extra work in getting the lock open. Thanks to the staff of the hotel i managed to unlock the car.",positive
"My party of 6 couples tour Sri Lanka annually. We have developed a friendly circle of Lankan friends there and never fail to enjoy our touring of this fascinating country. This property has always been on our list of hostelries and we do enjoy the ambience. Service is dependable and the food above average. The rack rates are on a par with similar European hotels and you will certainly be relieved of a lot of Dollars or Euros during your visit. And of course, the staff is paid at the prevailing poverty rate of Sri Lanka so the margin for this hotel must be handsome. And yet we always marvel at how efficient and professional the staff is considering their vastly underpaid salaries. As most international travelers know, these upscale hotels tout their in-room ""convenience bar"" as an enticing feature of their service. Somehow we are supposed to be honored to be able to purchase these exaggeratedly priced items. I suppose that the hotels theorize that throwing our money away on these insignificant ""treasures"" makes us feel socially superior. As a result of this, and on principle, my party avoids the handy bandits like a plague supplying our own snacks purchased at a mom & pop store on the way and use the bandits for storage. So it came to pass that I nonchalantly reached in for one of our Snickers and was horrified half way through that I realize that I had actually grabbed the hotel Mars Bar. So quickly I replaced it with one or our Snickers which was why the cashier at check-out time contracted a severe case of apoplexy when the chamber boy dramatically reported that he had found a desecrated Mars Bar wrapper in the trash and that a Snickers had been substituted. To give you perspective on the severity of the cashier's grand mal seizure, a Mars Bar, at 51 grams of sugar, waxed chocolate and fat, sells at 300 rupees, [current exchange rate = $2.37, mom & pop price 85 rs, 7 cents USD]). Through his glazed eyes the cashier could see a lost 353 % markup margin leading to corporate bankruptcy, for which he would undoubtedly be held responsible. The replacement Snickers at 57 grams (mom & pop 150 rs [$1.19 USD]) seemed not to appease him at all. Perhaps it was the total combined hotel bill of over $2,133 that clouded his aleertness and in the confusion we slipped out to our chauffeured car with instructions to the driver to out race the police if need be. I have instructed our travel clerk to delete this property from our standing list of Lankan hotels so that the cashier and management at Ahungalla can be absolved of having to host a notorious international group of candy bar thieves.",positive
"We stayed at room 260 from May 1st to May 5th 2013. After a change of our initial room which was not what we wanted, we enjoyed our stay very much. The staff was extermely professional, courteous and helpful. we felt that our needs were met and more. The food experience was memorable from local to seafood to international cuisine. The location and the beach are recommandable. We will surely recommand this hotel to our family and our friends and can not wait to visit again. A special thanks to all staff members who made our stay so pleasant, specially Dinusha (the front office executive).",positive
"Triton as we used to know it before re-branding, was a hotel i looked forward going to....unfortunately, not anymore... The rooms on the left wing are large & empty and the bathroom accesories were on the wrong side !! We booked in for half-board and dinner was hopeless, hardly any variety for a buffet & tasteless... but must say that breakfast the next morning made up for it !! The overall service was average, but the service in the dining area @ breakfast time was quite good",neutral
"This hotel has a fantastic location with it's own beach yards away from lobby & main Pool. The 2nd residential pool with a hot tub is also decently maintained. We visited during the Sinhalese New Year and the hotel was packed. Seems very popular amongst natives. The hotel has good amenities but is in need of a major face lift project. Stayed at 250. Our Bathroom wall could sure use a fresh coat of paint. Service level is good and Check In was pleasurable. But our request for a crib was only met after repeated reminders and 3 hours later. Food quality in the restaurants are good but there should be more variety/number of restaurants in a hotel of this level that boasts internationally acclaimed Chef. There are only two proper restaurants, one of which is predominantly for Buffet meals. With no alternatives for dining around the hotel surroundings, a couple more restaurants of various cuisines will serve the hotel well. But overall, my two night stay was pretty good and relaxing.",positive
"We spent a night at Heritance Ahungalla in the end of April 2013 and really enjoyed the experience. The hotel is spread out over a large property on the beach. It's spaced out, serence and you have your privacy. The staff was extremely courteous and helpful. Food was delicious and there's really nothing to complain. The stretch of beach that the hotel is on is beautiful....The drive and other places around the hotel are lovely too - several interesting antique & furniture shops. We've always enjoyed Aitken Spence hospitality!!!",positive
"During the Apr holiday period in Sri Lanka I was at heritance , I should say the property is located in a excellent place ,there are few hotel's in that starch but heritance stand tall among them due to the hard work of the General manager and his staff .from the time you step in to the time you go back you will be looked after like royalties . I would highly recommend Heritance to anybody want to visit Sri Lanka as well as I would visit back again when ever I go to Sri Lanka well done all you made my stay a very memorable one .",positive
"Lovely Atmosphere. It was a trip with friends so had a great time with activities... I enjoyed the food to the maximum & all meals were super, specially fresh seafood.The Beach was clean and relaxing environment. Service was nice & rooms were clean as well. Overall i rate it good & hope to visit back again.",positive
"We've been to heritance Ahungalla for one day just to spend our weekend.The hotel was amazing. We booked a premium Room but at the time of check in they said we have been upgraded to a luxury suit.Our room had a separate living room walk in closet , bath tub and separate shower and first of all huge private verandah with breathtaking view of the ocean. You get a good choice of food for all three main meals at the main restaurant and also you will have verity of restaurants to choose from.Even if they have an office party at the main pool don't worry you have another pool ""Green Pool"" only for residents.In every morning they have a man playing calm music with a flute at the main pool and that is so... relaxing. We had a wonderful stay at Heritance Ahungallaa and we'll be back soon. Thank you so much !",positive
Heritance Ahungalla became our most favorite location in Sri Lanka. We have been to the property for the first time and the beauty is you never get tired of it. Staff was very friendly and the service was Excellent. Diviyan Spa was excellent... Do not miss a massage if you are there... All three meals were buffet excellent food and the weekend buffets you will get the best variety. Only draw back was the weekday buffet with less variety.. Prompt service from the reception and they took us around a wonderful hotel tour including the back side of the hotel which was an great experience. We will come back again.,positive
"We visited Heritance Ahungalla recently and observed some pros and cons that might be useful to point out. Pros. 1. As the room was booked as a part of our anniversary, we were given the most spacious room of the category and really loved every bit of it. It was cozy and relaxing. Our favorite part was how it seemed to be a sort of a separate building to the main hotel and opened up to the jacuzzi and resident green pool. 2. The hotel in general was very relaxing and spacious and never felt like it was crowded. well probably because it wasnt! but either way even if there was a heavy crowd it felt like you had your own space. Cons. 1. TV - Ofcourse you dont come on a holiday to watch TV BUT it would be great to have a few good options. The cable tv had very few channels excluding some of the most entertaining movie and tv show channels which I thought was a bit of a bummer. 2. The food was not great and not bad. Average I must say. We expected a large spread but it seemed that since it was off peak season and less crowd also because it was a weekday, there was very little variety and thereby ""threw a dagger"" to our expectations. Anyway Thanks Heritance for the nice stay and we hope to see you again sometime!",positive
"My spouse and I stayed at the Heritance Ahungalla for two nights while touring in Ahungalla in late-April. On the first night, I would have given the hotel a three star rating, but having stayed here for two nights, I give it a four out of five rating (I would have given the hotel full marks if not for some minor details). Amenities/Common Areas: Cons: --surprisingly (expensive) food charges. Shortly after arriving at the hotel, we took luncheon at the Mustard dining area. At the end of the meal, we were presented with a bill with additional compulsory 10% service charge (mentioned in the menu) and a 15.75% government tax, not mentioned in the menu (surprise!). Magically, our 30 USD meal became 40 USD. --sad koi not swimming in the moat around the main dining room. Pros: --the second (very large) swimming pool was less than ten meters away from our room, extremely convenient and inviting --douche in the toilet --two swimming pools of different depths. The front swimming pool had a deep end of more than 2.5 meters. Very nice as many hotels don’t have such depth for lap-swimmers like myself. --grounds are extremely well kept (very green) Breakfast: The spread is excellent with a huge variety of South Asian dishes (curries, milk rice, hoppers), cheeses, bread, meats, etc. The only thing I found lacking were green vegetables that weren’t raw or prepared in a curry. No stir-fried vegetables, no sautéed spinach. Room Description: Cons: -- We requested for a king-sized bed, but instead got two twins pushed together. This was a bit irritating with the gap in the middle. --Room service for a bucket of ice was prompt on our first night, but took about half an hour on our second night. --not completely spotless for a five star hotel. The office area in our room had cobwebs on the lamp for both nights we were here (see attached photo). --electrical outlets not the same in every room (we were shown a room with an international electrical outlet, but the room we chose closer to the pool had only Indian-style electrical outlets.) Pros: --The beds were very comfortable. --Direct access to the swimming pool and beach. Conclusion: I will come here again. The direct access to the pool was so convenient. The environment was so nice, casual and friendly. I would recommend this hotel to my friends and family if they were to visit Ahungalla.",positive
"This hotel is showing it's age slightly. The rooms are fine and the surroundings are beautiful but just not quite top notch. However we found the standard of service to be superb and are surprised at some of the reviews rating the service poor. We ate dinner in the main restaurant once and the Mustard Cafe three times. One meal in the Mustard Cafe was not up to scratch - the stirred fried beef looked as if it has been made several days ago - all dried up. However all the other meals were excellent. Breakfasts in the main restaurant were very good. There are two swimming pools - one by the main entrance and one outside the north wing. This latter pool was huge and nice to swim in. We also paddled in the sea which is right outside the hotel. The waves were very strong while we were there so it was not safe to go swimming but the sand is beautiful. There are people selling on the beach - it is difficult to see how the hotel could get rid of them as presumably it is a public place. However we didn't feel too pestered as we just ignored them and they went away. All the staff were friendly and courteous. The room boy was especially cheerful and the room kept really clean, in fact they changed the linen more than we needed",positive
"Truly amazing experience . Excellent location, clean beach , great food and super service. Hotel .... Nice large rooms with all good facilities . . . Buffet was good with many action stations. Overall excellent stay and will be going back for sure !!!",positive
"While the food, the rooms and location are quite easily on par with the best Sri Lanka has to offer, the service level put the Heritance Ahungalla in a class of its own. Exceptionally well mannered, attentive and professional in every way.",positive
"We really enjoyed our stay at the Heritance,. The hotel is in a beautiful location with a very clean beach.

Our six day stay at Ahungalla was really nice with a kind and helpful staff. We was glad to meet the staff every day because they gave good service and recogniced us. Good management and excellent staff ist two things that really are special here. We have been on many hotels on Sri Lanka (>20) and the level of service so far is best here.,positive
"Let me say few words just after vacation.Hotel is located in really good place close to the ocean.Hotel staff is ok.Good rooms.Our room had great view on to the ocean. As I understand, Heritance is the best choice. Minuses: breakfast could be little better. Hotel staff should replace buggage trolley wheels from plastic with rubber to avoid noise from corridor early morning. Recommend to everyone to enjoy time in Heritance Ahungalla. Vitaliy. Odessa,Ukraine",positive
"Driving up to the hotel it looks wonderful, and it is. Great welcome, and always friendly staff. Two pools, set over a large area, lots of space to seat out. Set over 3 floors, long corridors.Gym, and spa (expensive). 3 restaurants, very good veg curry, best we had all holiday.Balcony to all rooms. Rooms could do with a little more lighting, very dark if you want to read or do work. The Large restaurant that is used for breakfast, is all enclosed, some times gets very noisy and stuffy. Breakfast food very good. Can be hassled by local sellers on the beach but they will move on once you say NO. would stay here again.",positive
This is the second time I stayed at the Heritance. I want to go back there again. Its such a nice hotel with excellent staff...It was overlooking the beach and they had two nice swimming pools...The rooms were also great each having a small verandah/ balcony to have tea or enjoy some fresh air. I would recommend Heritance to anyone,positive
It was home away from home; we found the friendliest staff at this hotel. Every staff member had a smile. The hotel is professionally managed and the staff is aware of what’s happening daily basis. Comfortable rooms.,positive
"Heritance Ahungalla is a beautiful hotel, with 2 relaxing pools and a wonderful beach just a short walk away. The management is excellent and the staff go out of their way to help you and make you feel comfortable. This is also a very kid friendly hotel with kids' activities like magic shows, painting and sand castle building planned over weekends. The rooms are well equipped and comfortable and most have beautiful views of the pool and/or ocean. The breakfast and dinner buffets were exceptional with a vast array of Sri Lankan and continental selections. Overall, we give this hotel 5 stars and would definitely recommend this to our friends and family visiting Sri Lanka. Bill and Prashanthi",positive
In addition to the friendly and efficient staff it had everything our family wanted.There were activities for our kids. Entertainments for us and they helped our wheel chair bound father all the time it is needed.Two good swimming pools and almost every sport tennis TT badminton and billiards ete and the nice beach with TLC by the staff.It was a wonderful stay.,positive
"This hotel is positioned on a wonderful beach. While the hotel is starting to show its age the staff try very hard to look after the guests. The breakfast buffet is great to start the day and everyone should try the egg hopper! The beach is the real bonus of this hotel and the waves are great for body surfing. However, there is also one BIG downside. It would be great to be able to be enjoy the beach without the constant attention (unwanted!) of the touts trying to sell cheap and nasty products on the beach. It became so unwanted that we were forced to retreat to the privacy of the hotel, a not bad second option. Having spoken to the manager about touts it is clear that the hotel is trying to address the issue but is not there yet. I wish them success!",neutral
"It was a great place to stay, will definitely recommend it to all our friends planing to stay in that area, we mostly liked the spacious rooms and the friendly staff, the two pools were very relaxing and the sea view is incredible, thank you.",positive
"i had stayed two nights at this Hotel i have nothing to complain about the offerings but would like to mention that i noticed there is some improvement to the service offered compared to my stay thress years ago, i also noticed that overall staff are friendly willing to help since i have a toddler whenever we go to the restaurant the door staff open door help lift the stroller up the few steps, many of the chefs manning the cooking stations were helpful one such gentleman was M.C.De Silva he offered to make us a simple toddler meal that our toddler would like to have in other words a kids meal free of charge, he was humble and extremely polite, his speciality was making great Hoppers that he churned out at the hopper station during breakfast to keep up with the demannd, i have had hoppers in other hotels as well but this guy knew the right consistency and performed fast in delivering the demand for hoppers.you get that feeling that you have stepped in to a hotel but then you feel at home with the service.",positive
"We stayed here for 3 nights at the end of our touring holiday. Although we had a room with a beach view it was above the bar area - and each evening we had to endure really loud really awful karaoke type music. Luckily this only went on until just past 11 but it sure wasn't the peaceful, relaxing stay we had anticipated. We asked to change rooms but were told it was not possible. The food was luke warm and the service, particularly for drinks, was slow. We did enjoy time spent around the quieter of the 2 pools and the beach was only a short stroll away. There were touts but we got used to them, it's a third world country after all. It wasn't a disastrous stay by any means but I would describe it as more of a 3 star than it's supposed status of 5 star - so it's expensive for what you get. Be warned - it's about 3-4 hours drive from the airport.",neutral
"The hotel was great, nice beach and good stay. Rooms r big n comfortable, lil bit expensive compare to prices in srilanka! Nice view but keep the window closed, I had 2 cockroach in my room! Week ends n holidays too many local w kids come to the pool, if u don't like kids AVOID it",neutral
"four of us stayed three nights. we really enjoyed the food which were well made. hotel was beautiful and the staff was very nice and friendly. but we found for the price we paid, rooms should be of higher standard. Room carpet was dirty, had loose light fittings etc. Also found unpainted toilet walls making them gloomy. Overall, we loved our stay.",positive
"After a slightly delayed check in that coincided with a bus load of Australian junior cricketers and their families, we soon forgot any inconvenience as we were welcomed into the wonderful warm world that is the Heritance Family. We had a great time at Kandalama and this property did not disappoint either. We had visions of going ""out"" but it was too easy to stay in! Love Love Love this place!",positive
"The views are simply breathtaking, no person can take credit for the beautiful ocean, but this hotel is certainly well-placed to enjoy it in all its splendour. The staff are outstanding, smiling, gentle and very helpful at all times. The real excellence (apart from the ocean) is undoubtedly the food - i've been back a week and still miss it - it is simply outstanding. the rooms are spacious, clean, and although the surrounding 'gardens' are a little tired, overall an amazing experience to stay here. The only thing is the spa - very expensive prices, in an area where you can get the same treatments for a fraction of the price... I came with a friend - two mums and our 12-yr-old-sons - very welcoming, very safe, very relaxing if the kids love the pool and you enjoy the views/reading/sky-watching. I highly recommend - expensive, but worth it.",positive
"Stayed here for two nights with family in late March-2013. The staff are friendly and obliging. The breakfast, lunch, and dinner spreads were good. A wide variety to choose from. We were pleased to learn that the hotel does not use MSG in their food. The facilities are great. However, the rooms and the bathrooms are aging. Nevertheless, they are extremely clean. The beach is great.",positive
7 of us spent the weekend at Heritance Ahungalla and the overall service was excellent. From the time of check in to check out it was almost like a personalized service. Food was excellent and had a good spread.Additional requests were entertained positively.,positive
"Staff is very friendly and the atmosphere very relaxed. The rooms are spacious. Food is highly recommended, specially the breakfast. Dip in the pool is a must and is a very relaxing expereience. Can accomodate large groups too. Ideal for corporate trips/ resdient conferences as well.",positive
"i spent a weekend here with my family, parents and in laws. it was the second heritance hotel i stayed, kandalama being the first.for me the highlight was the staff. all so friendly, attentive and very helpful and full of smiles!! loved that. the rooms were clean and comfy. the air conditioning was little on the warm side i thought. may be it was due to the very hot weather we had. and although the website says all rooms are with sea views (we stayed in deluxe) not all have great sea views, so better ask specifically when booking. the food was excellent in keeping with the heritance reputation, with a huge buffet with many options. breakfast was our favorite. only thing i noted was the lack of fish this being a beach hotel!!each menu had only one dish of fish. and no fish at the BBQ night. missed the grilled fish. the two pools and the jacuzzi were great spots for relaxation and some fun. not to mention the private beach with clean sands. a negative point is rooms being not ready by the time of check in. overall it is a wonderful place to spend a holiday with family, kids or for a romantic getaway.",positive
Itz nice relaxing place with tasty food I got room front of pool I preferd pool room are good n clean with gud shower itz nice place to relax feel free b relax with this wonderful place. We had buffet at resturant seafoods are tasty I think I love the pool of this hotel,positive
"If you don't want a place that is too swish, but is warm, friendly and laissez faire, this is for you. Big enough for you to be inconspicuous, staff welcome you at every encounter. The food is amazing - but then I'm a huge fan of the local seafood cuisine. Great residents' pool, nice and quiet, plenty of room to swim. Nice gardens and grounds border the huge beach. Great value, and really relaxing.",positive
"We arrived by pre-booked transfer at Heritance Ahungalla at 8am. and were shown to our room within an hour after a welcome drink. Check-in isn't normally till 2pm.. Housekeeping were quick to install 2 'z' beds in our room for our 2 children, 4 and 10 yrs old. All of the staff we came into contact with were friendly and helpful. The hotel itself is beautifully designed, but in need of some TLC. There are 4 dining options at the hotel which can get a bit boring after you've tried them all, there is a shack half way down the beach which also serves food and alcohol run by the locals, and that's it. Bentota is the nearest village with other dining options and is 20 min tuk tuk ride away. The hotel is classed as 5 Star by Sri Lankan standards, we live in the UAE and have been very spoilt by the hotels here with regards to service and the hotels themselves, I would then say the hotel is more in line with a 3 star in the UAE or a 4/5 in the UK. You have to remember you are on the coast of a small island with the jungle on one side of you and the sea on the other, and that the whole area was devastated after the Tsunami of 2004. The transfer from the airport to the hotel too 2.5 hours using the new highway toll road and cost us an extra 250 Sri Lankan Rupees, £3 ish, on our return trip the driver didn't use the toll road even though we told him to, and used the main coast road through all the villages before driving through the centre of Columbo, 3.5 bumpy hours later we arrived at the airport. There are kids activities between 3-5 in the afternoon but we never used them as our kids were just happy to play in the pool, and we never used the spa. Electric sockets are circular 3-pin with the occasional square 3-pin socket. The bathrooms / balconies would benefit from a washing line, somewhere to dry off swim wear! The hotel shop stocks very little, so if you need any toiletries or paracetemol you need to go off site.",positive
Quite disorganised staff. My car was taken to be parked but never given a token as reference. Fail to find the key afterwords which I had to go and select myself. Checkin time was 2pm and the time now is 2:40 ....still waiting for a room to be ready ....Will think twice before booking this hotel again.,negative
"I live in Dubai, so I know what a USD$400 per night hotel room should get you. Therefore, in Sri Lanka, it should be at least on par - if not a thousand times better. This review comes with a disclaimer – the hotel did compensate me with a rather dramatic discount upon departure. I do not believe that this hotel can realistically charge the amount they do for this level of property and service. In the end I believe we paid a fair amount for what we received. They begged me not to write a bad review, so I will not, but I will state the truth. Let’s start with the “pros”: - Beautifully designed hotel with authentic colonial architecture. - Lovely view from most of the balconies. - Several dining options available. - Good bathrooms. - Good a/c in rooms. - Massages at the spa are heavenly. Probably the best I’ve ever had! - Management responded well to our complaints. Now over to the “cons”: - The “confirmed” airport transfer was not booked. We waited 2 hours at the airport before they finally arranged. - Our room was filthy. Even after complaining it did not improve. - Room service, bar and snack menus are the same. No Sri Lankan food in sight! - Manicure and hair treatments at the spa were disastrous (rough nails and stripped colour from hair). - Dirty linen at all F&B outlets and room service.",negative
"Heritance Ahungalla is our family's most favourite seaside getaway. We've been to the property many times, but the beauty is that you never get tired of it. I have seen my kids growing up to embrace the ambiance of the hotel over the years from the days of their infancy. The staff has been very cooperative, sometimes even baby sitting while we ate. Now that my kids are big; 4 n 6; on every visit, they pick up a way to enjoy the hotel on their own. My last visit was on the 28th of March this year; a tight squeeze of one day between two hectic days. For the first time my junior jumped into the pool. It broke his heart to know that we would have to leave so soon. In fact, both were sulky with misty eyes when we left. They only asked, ""When are we coming back?"" We thought of altering our regular April holiday plan and now have decided to visit Hertinace Ahungalla again for three nights this April. The place really deserves it. You find the most amazing Front Office Manager; Indika, great support in the restaurant and wonderful crew everywhere; very friendly, energetic and ready to help. The rooms are very clean, spacious and comfy. The beds are cozy and snugly. Bawa's architecture in this property, is family friendly and cheerful. The beach is safe n inviting. To me, the sea, the pool and the Jacuzzi make up the right blend to spend the day. Awesome! Can't wait to get back.",positive
"This was the first time in Sri Lanka and what a beautiful experience. Hotel has open lobby with pool and beach that you can see upon arrival. When arrived we were accommodated and given a very refreshing welcome drink. Room key was given quite fast, however instead of the booked king bedroom we were given a twin room. Once approached they changed our room and provide us with correct one. Pools are very nice and the ocean view is fantastic. Food in the restaurant was very good with good variety and quality. Overall we really enjoyed the place and staff was very friendly and always willing to help.",positive
"If you are looking for a beach resort along the west coast of Sri Lanka, Heritance Ahungalla is just perfect ! It has everything you would need/want/desire !!! Pool Activities - water aerobics was just great, Beach Activities, Relaxation at the spa, Excellent Food, Great Service.....Beautiful and comfortable rooms....it had everything....just did not find the need to go out of the resort for anything what-so-ever. The breakfast spread is great !!! Make reservations for the beach dinner....TIP: Do not walk bare foot on the beach, some areas might have unwanted objects.. Also dont forget to take some time to visit the library and sit at the beautiful bay window to enjoy a good chat over some good books !!",positive
Me and my wife and her family visited first time Heritance Ahungalle in 2010. And after that me and my wife visited the hotel every year for the last 3 times. And we are visiting again in May 2013 . I have been travelling a lot and visited many resturents and hotels. And out of that i have never experienced such plesent and wonderful service from anyware else. I was surprised to see the bad comment down from the chinese visitor bellow. I'm more than sure that we are not talking about the same hotel. I don't know why he wrote such a bad comment and I guess it is someone who wants to do some dirty marketing. But I guarntee that this hotel is very safe. There are security staff all arround the beach for the visitors protection and last time when i went with my wife and with my 1 year old daughter the staff really looked after us. We felt so much cared and respected. The food was great and infact their food is one of the best out off many hotels in the island. I RECOMEND HERITANCE AHUNGALLE HOTEL TO SOLO TRAVELLERS TO FAMILY TRAVELLERS.,positive
"I've spent two nights on B&B basis at Heritance Ahungalla. Actually my wife and myself had a good time at the hotel with its really nice surroundings. The bedroom was pleasant and relaxing. We really loved the pretty large beach area which is just great! also the pool was spacious. However the responsiveness of the staff and follow up was poor. E.g. My wife is pregnant and she needed bottled water as we have run out of the two, so i phoned house keeping .. hours passed by without any water at all. So i had to go my self to the bar and get two bottles. We even called the reception and they said they will look into it. Water to the room never arrived. Meal variety in ala carte menu was not good either. For people who signed up for B&B doesn't have a variety to choose from. Even at different locations such as Coffee shop and snack bar have the same menu. no choice what so ever and we couldn't make a decision as what to eat.",negative
"The waiters needs to be trained about the table etics as they try to clear plates before the client finishes having the meal. Also, we requested a tripe room and a double room was given by just adding a folding bed. They facilities for the room was only for two and we had to request for the third persons facilities on anf off despiting paying for a triple. the reason given by da hotel for not providing a tripe room was it was not ready of occupation. Thats the main reason I have rated the rooms poor. Tks.....",negative
"Came here for a couple of nights on our family trip to Sri Lanka. Rooms were clean and comfortable and service was overall very good. The main breakfast / dinner restaurant was always smoky (from preparing food) and it seemed there was no air con or exhaust fan to remove the smoke. Selection of food at the buffet was good. Cocktails were poorly made and extremely strong! Pool was not as clean as expected and it didn't seem that it was cleaned everyday. Jacuzzi was full of sand. The shower glass in our bathroom had soap scum which looked like it hadn't been cleaned for a month. Security around the perimeter of the hotel especially on the beach side needs to be beefed up. There were a few people around the beach who were hassling the patrons. The positives were that there was a live band at the bar every night and amazing views of the beach from the rooms. Overall, average especially for a resort that is meant to be 5 star.",neutral
"HOTEL: We stayed at the Heritance for 10 Nights. The hotel and staff are lovely. After reading a previous review about being to scared to leave the room, i feel that this is an insult the the hard working staff there. At no point did we feel we threatened by staff, housekeeping staff smiled and never asked for a tip and the same said with the staff in the bar area. I suppose the hotel could do with a lick of paint but as for broken sunbeds i didnt see any, and there was always loads to choose from. The only negative thing about the room is the size of the fridge which is very small. But again it wasnt a real problem. YES.. you tip for most things but we never felt preasured to do so, and even if you do its 100rs at a time! The sellers on the beach are a bit of a pain, but a firm no and they go off to the next person, and after a while getting the same response from us they didnt even bother. Our room was on the 3rd floor and it was lovely, and we even had our own little gekcho which was great for eating insects. Our room was cleaned twice a day with clean towels and more water. The food was lovely, the only downside is there isnt much options for vegitarians. The only major downside with ther Heritance was location. when we travel we like to go out and try local resturants which is why we booked b&b, however other then the little fish resturant (which is cheap with lovely food) along the beach there isnt anything walking distance. We did take a taxi RS3500 (that waited 3hrs and brought us back to the hotel) to Hikkaduwa where you'll find bars/resturants and several rotty cafe. If we'd of known this we would of booked HB as we ended up spending most evenings eating in the hotel. TOURS: We did several trips whilst in Sri Lanka. The first to Uda Walawe park, as much as it was a long drive it was lovely to see the elephants roaming around freely, its def worth a visit. We then did a 2 day trip to Kandy and Sigiriya again a lot of driving, we stopped off at a tea shop on the way which was ok, then the botanical gardens which is a lovely place to sit with an ice cream and watch the world go by. We then went to the temple of tooth which was lovely, and to be honest go without a guide as ours was a bit of an idiot trying to get us to pay for him to study etc etc.. which we felt was very cheeky whilst inside a buddhist temple!!! In Kandy We stayed at Chaaya Citadel which was lovely and great food, to be honest it was a shame we only stayed the night. The next day we had an early start and more driving to Sigiriya, this was via a spice market and to be honest at 830am we probably wasnt the most awake customers!! but we listened and left! Once we arrived at Sigirya we headed up the many steps in the mid morning heat!!! the views at the top are lovely and make for great photos, they even had a family of monkeys that live on the top. Then it was the 7hr drive back to the hotel. Be warned your driver will take you to various tea/gem and spice shops!!!! We asked our driver if we could skip these but its something they have to do, even though we put our foot down and said no to the gem store. Overall we enjoyed our stay at the Heritance and its lovely staff.",negative
"We stayed at this hotel for four days and it was the worst hotel experience ever. A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY AND A VERY EXPENSIVE DISASTER! I recommend reading the lowest reviews for this hotel before you book; there is a real discrepancy between the nightmare reviews and those that are praising this hotel. Make sure you understand what is the worst that could happen to you also if you choose to stay here, because the worst scenario did happen to us. We did not read what the low ratings on Tripadvisor said about the Heritance Ahungalla. We wished we did because so many of these complaints reflect our experience. My friend and I are both seasoned travelers, and have stayed in both five star accommodation and budget ones, all over the world. Given the cost of staying at this hotel, we were both incredibly disappointed and also traumatised during their stay. We felt so uncomfortable and threatened during our stay that we locked ourselves in our hotel room. We have lodged a formal complaint to the travel agency about our stay at the Heritance Ahungalla. Our main complaints are as follows: - Worst service: for the entire duration of the trip, the staff was incredibly rude. There was no ‘hospitality’. The staff pestered us repeatedly for tips, from the receptionist to cleaning staff to waiters. When we made all the complaints listed below to the staff, we were completely ignored and were shouted at. No attempts were made to apologise or to resolve the problems. We were incredibly frustrated by this, and were very close to tears. - Terribly unhygienic: stained bedsheets, dust and mould. Restaurant tableware and cutlery was not cleaned properly and had stains. - Pests: cockroaches, flies and mosquitoes in the bedroom and the bathroom. - Touts: The hotel was full of touts, from the pool to the beach, also pestering us and other guests to buy their goods. At one point, one of the touts even made a completely disgusting sexual advance on my friend! The hotel made no effort to safeguard the safety and/or privacy of their guests. - Food: the food was always lukewarm at best, and/or cold. Food would take at least 45 minutes to arrive. We ended up eating only burgers and fries for the four days that we were there, as it was the only food we felt was safe. For a holiday experience, this was disappointing. It would have been better to have just eaten McDonald’s. - Bad facility condition: The hotel is quite old, and many parts require fixing. A number of sunbeds were broken and completely unusable. We will never stay there again and are warning everyone who visits Sri Lanka to avoid this place. If you plan on staying there, at least read both the good and bad reviews to decide for yourself. There is a higher risk staying at this hotel, because of its location. It is incredibly far away from Colombo and any other properties, so if you arrive here and the hotel is a complete disappointment, there is no other property that you can escape to. BEWARE!",negative
"The hotel is of an excellent standard - first class attentive and friendly staff, lovely swimming pool and located on the beach. This is an ideal place to spend a few days after a tour of the island which we had done. The food is varied and of an excellent quality, but do watch out for the curries - the staff claimed they were 'medium' but far hotter than the average vindaloo in the UK!",positive
"Very nice hotel! We was for the first time in Asian and we are very happy about our hotel choice. Excellent location, beach is a pure paradise, alot of smiles, sun, fruits, ocean, a very good library with books and magazines in many languages, very funny animals around the pools and great service! A special Thanks to Mr.Nihal and his staff for making our stay absolutly perfect! We wanna alredy come back to Heritance! But we missed a russian chanel on TV and more varied breakfast (it was the same every day!) to stay on Heritance longer.",positive
"Had a beautiful holiday at the Heritance Ahungalla with my family. Nothing prepared me for the warm welcome and the hospitable and warm reception of the staff at this five-star resort located on the southern beaches of Sri Lanka. My reservation was efficiently and warmly handled by Lakshitha of Front Office, who continuously made sure that our stay was enjoyable. During our meals, the assistance extended by Anushka at the restaurant was unforgettable. Her smile seems to be permanent and I never saw her without her friendly smile throughout the two days I was there. The food must be the best in the entire southern coast of Sri Lanka. It is prepared under the careful guidance and supervision of an award-winning chef. Beautiful Holiday! Beautiful Hotel! Look forward to visiting again and again.",positive
"Highly recommended if you are in Bentota. Beautiful location, well designed hotel with modern amenities. Smiling & commited staff. Beautifully located swimming pools. You always wish you could have stayed little longer.",positive
We stayed here for 3 days then visited Yala and came back for another 4 days the food is outstanding especially the desserts. The pools are both stunning and the wild life around it are amazing we saw several Squirrel type cute and friendly and several large reptiles. The staff are very friendly always happy and willing to help. The rooms very tasteful we had room 257 and 304 I like 304 best it is a little smaller than the others but the views of the sea and pool more than compensate. They also made a Birthday Cake for me which was much appreciated.,positive
"We booked this hotel through an agency based on their recommendation. Stayed two nights. We loved the place. The hotel design is unbelivable. Stunning as you arrive at the reception. The blue pool and sea are seen in one veiw. Great. The rooms were large and very comfortable with wifi. Resturant and food very good. There are 4 restaurants. The most striking thing was the service. Unbelivable. People so responsive and freidly. I saw reviews from past years complaining about the service. I guess they made a big change. Bottom line - one of the best hotels we have visited. You have everything, great facilities, great pools great beach and great service. Aldaag",positive
"We were met with cool drinks and cold flannels after a long trip from the North of the island. The staff were wonderful although there was some confusion with us being all inclusive (some of the staff did not quite get the meaning of this). We were upgraded on arrival to a beautiful room overlooking the pool and the sea. The rooms were clean and tended twice a day by very friendly staff who took great pleasure in arranging our towels into numerous animal shapes. The food in the restaurants was always beautifully presented and there was plenty of choice for everyone We were apprehensive as although we eat curry my husband is not a huge lover of it so we were delighted with the choices we had. . The staff were again exceptionally good and eager to please, We had an early pick up and the staff were kind enough to make us a packed breakfast to take with us.",positive
"This place was the highlight of the trip. The place is very well designed, amazing architecture. Although there was a slight glitch when we checked in, one of the 4 rooms we had booked wasnt ready. They literally took 2 hours to set the place up but it smelt really nice and it was worth the wait. Stepped out into the balcony and saw an elephant being bathed. then there were horses running in circles in the compound. It was amazing also because I got to share the view with my neices and nephew who were wth us. The breakfast was decent. Lots of fruits, be sure to feast on them when in srilanka. there's an outside-yet-inside sort of sitting area near the pool, connects to the bar. sometimes monkeys ( some variant ) sit on the tree tops but they're harmless and quite cute when u consider that they arent threatened by the development. Be wary of the touts on the beach. They're harmless but they tend to annoy u a bit, especially the ladies who are selling some thing or the other and they'll stick to you unless you can politely and firmly tell them that you arent interested. there's a seafood place on the beach, didnt check it out but drove around 20 mins to another seafood place which wasnt that bad but a bit overpriced. I would recommend this to people who can pay the premium. There are other options though if ur on a budget, closer to the last town you'll pass on the way to heritance. And, other than the curtains there are shutters which shut u off from all any light which might finds it way inside. the balcony is spacious too.",positive
"The reception area is large and open with beautiful views out to sea. The staff are welcoming and immediately cannot do enough for you. We arrived tired and fed up after finding no room for us at Jetwing Lighthouse despite a booking being made April 2012 (see separate review). The hotel was about to welcome the Sri Lanka and Bangladeshi international cricket teams and although there was great excitement we were made to feel just as important. We were told there would be extra security but this did not affect us at all. Bearing in mind we were not expected we had a fabulous 3rd floor upgraded room overlooking the sea and the pool. The choices at dinner and breakfast could not have been better and when I asked for some French cheese the chef apologised and said he would try and get some for the morning. Although it did not appear at breakfast the enthusiasm was there. Great hotel, great location.",positive
"My husband booked this hotel for our holiday. We were there for 5 days. Absolutely loved it here. It is an older hotel but with the best hospitality ever. Our room was quite large and with a wonderful view of the ocean and the second pool. They take care of your every need. You are greeted upon your arrival and through your stay. The Indian Ocean is right there so, as you swim in the beautiful endless pool your view is spectacular. They cleaned our room twice a day. Waited on our every whim. Took care of us through the stay. They have a ""Upper Room"" restaurant that was a bit expensive but the food was the best I have ever put in my mouth. If you want to relax, be pampered, and have the most awesome holiday ever, than stay here!!! The drive from the airport is a bit long but by August of 2013 it will be a 45 minute drive because of the new toll road that will be complete.",positive
"I visited this hotel a couple of times & this is one place you should try for sure irrespective of whether you are a local or tourist. From the lobby itself you can feel the difference. True that there are many hotels with wonderful facilities...some might even have better facilities than here but the real factor that makes a difference here is the ""people factor"". The employees of this hotel made me & my team feel very special indeed. They have what I would call the personal touch which is the most important thing. I was truly amazed as to how far the General Manager,Residential Manager, Head Chef etc is willing to go to make us happy & make the visits simply perfect! If I were to commment about the faclities....lovely rooms...infinity pool...great restaurants...bar..sat TV....wifi....animators, DJs to facilitate groups....night club..beach view....etc..What more would one want? And also the food is worth every bit that you pay. The range they offer in their buffets is vast & delicious...it'll fit both young & old alike...I would recommend Heritance Ahungalla for a family\business trip without any reservations! Looking forward to my next visit there! Cheers!",positive
"Just wanted to relax and did just that . Service was pretty good, very courteous and all staff could converse well. Room was in top shape ( slept like well behaved babies) , view was amazing, pool was fab and the food was just as brilliant . Had good memories from back in the day and glad we could relive it . Thanks !",positive
"Stayed here for a conference & was pleasantly surprised. This is a superb hotel with everything taken care off. Superb location facing the sea ( private beach ) with an excellent infinity pool facing the sea. I was given to understand that this property was hit during tsunami...but now nobody can say so..such wonderfully it has been kept. Service is excellent & the staff really tries their best to keep every guest happy & contended. They give a very traditional welcome which is nice. Rooms are very good..but the only drawback is the room air conditioning. Hope they could improve that what with Sri Lanka remaining hot & humid most of the time. Breakfast service is very good & the quality of food is top class! They have nice bars. The hotel also organises local boat trips which is very nice. This would be a very good place to come with family & I would love to do so at some point. The hotel gets the local craftsmen to sell their wares each evening...and each day a different set of villagers come to sell different types of local manufactured goods. This was a nice gesture and tourists like us could buy the local stuff without bothering to get out of the hotel. On one evening, we had an event in the open facing the sea...but due to a sudden downpour, we had to change indoors. To my surprise, the hotel team managed that effortlessly in just half an hour!! Much appreciated. Would love to be back here.",positive
"We stayed at the Heritance Ahungalla for 6 nights following a tour of Sri Lanka arriving back in the UK on the 4th March. Our travel agent, Clare at Journeys a la Carte had personally recommended this hotel, having stayed there herself quite recently. From arrival and check-in to leaving 6 nights later we had a superb experience and a very restful holiday. Our room was on the 3rd floor, overlooking the hotel guests only swimming pool, with a wonderful view over the beach and out over the sea, great for watching the sunset! The room was spacious and modern (the hotel was built in the early 1980's but you would not know it because it has been very well kept and updated) and kept immaculately whilst we were there, with fresh towels every day, complimentary water daily and even fresh fruit. Dining was as easy as we have experienced anywhere and the quality and variety of the food enough for any discerning diner. The hotel features a Celebrity Chef on it's website and the results he produces justifies the hype; of course there were curries available at every meal but also a selection of meals from around the world with something for everyone and always well cooked and presented. The grounds of the hotel were kept clean and tidy at all times and we were always able to find sun loungers available in the spots we wanted to be sitting in. I'm sure the hotel was busy but it just did not seem frantic and there was a complete absence of hustle and bustle, hence the Tranquility and Serenity in the heading of this review. We were on half-board and drinks and lunches were charged extra but it was a very easy matter to charge this to your room, settling the bill at the end of the stay. We had no problems doing this and no difficulty when it came to checking out. The staff were just superb, always smiling, always friendly, nothing too much trouble and never obviously doing it for the tips. Tips, if given, were accepted with appreciation. We could mention many by name but if we did, we would not do justice to all those who helped make our holiday very special, whose names we did not note. Nevertheless, we must mention Mandulla in the Restaurant and the beautiful girl who greeted us at each mealtime with a beaming smile and traditional ""Ayubowan"" - sorry we did not get your name. Entertainment was good with the music from both the modern trio and the very traditional drummers and dancers a delight to hear and watch. Never too intrusive and certainly never blaring out endlessly and mindlessly as I'm sure many people have experienced in other countries. Listening to the guy playing his flute sitting in the old boat near the swimming pool on a morning was an excellent way to start the day, so gentle and quiet! It was possible to go out of the hotel to explore the local shops and bars, Rosie's was worth a visit and the beer, just as good as in the hotel but less expensive. Walking out always prompted the local tuktuk drivers to offer their services but this was always done in a non-aggressive way and if refused, they just waited for the next passenger. Money changing was very easy in the hotel and whilst we may not have enjoyed the best rates we had the convenience.",positive
"Last hotel in our Sri Lanka group tour holiday. Location was superb...street, hotel, swimming pool, beach, Indian ocean, what can you ask more ? Big hotel with open lobby area. Large room with garden, ocean view, comfortable bed, airco could be a little bit cooler but you can correct this with the ventilator fan on the ceiling. Negative point in the room is the lack of lamps/lighting. Bathroom, spacious, clean and large shower cabin, no bath in our room but that's what we like. Minor remark in the bathroom were the (polished) concrete (!) walls. Maybe design like, but felt a little bit as a bunker from WWII. Very large and clean swimming pool with free beds and towels on request. Bar, open on the swimming pool side, very nice. Beautiful white sandy beach. Dinner at the restaurant was tasteful, buffet style with plenty to choose from, always fresh sea food available ! Prices for wine are normal ! Nice selection too. Good service. During the night you hear the sound of the ocean, magnificent. Pity we stayed here for only two nights because this hotel is perfect for a longer beach holiday !!!",positive
"Stayed here on a recent tour of Sri Lanka. Took quite some time to check in, room was ordinary clean except for shower stall which was filthy. Service at pool bar was good, pool fabulous! Room service was good, food delicious, though they tried to overcharge, said prices had gone up since menu printed. Breakfast very ordinary, restaurant looked tired and in need of refurbishment. Checkout a bit weird but room service overcharge sorted.",positive
"The Hotel is nicely done, with an infinity pool and all the works..it has a great view of the Indian Ocean. The rooms are nice too and the service is quite friendly and nice. What I would like to change about the place is the food -- particularly the dessert option. I didn't think the selection and/or the quality met the quality of such a highly rated hotel.",positive
"Good location, excellent service, marvelous suits, huge water pool, tasty food and very pleasant employees (especially Annushka in the main restaraunt). One of the best hotels I've ever stayed at. Highly recommended!",positive
"This being the fifth and last hotel of our trip (other than our final night being back at the Jetwing Beach Negombo), arriving after a gruelling seven and a half hour transfer from Nuwara Eliya I was a little disappointed with this hotel. The open lobby facing the pool and fishing catamarran with beach and sea behind was an impressive feature. There was also after dinner entertainment just inside this area although the quality of the singers was cringeworthy. We were pleased with the large room of the standard we had come to expect on our trip and our first floor balcony looked over greenery to the beach. Great beach but irritating hawkers. Buffet restaurant which I found a little disappointing and unfortunately although it may have been down to one family, crying babies at every meal we had. Lovely friendly and polite staff once again. This south west coast area including Galle which we visited was perhaps not the most interesting of the trip to me although there were some sobering reminders of the tsunami here including many graves along the beach road. The nearby mangrove boat trip complete with crocodiles, cinnamon island, island temple and fish pedicure was a must and great fun. Not a bad hotel, just not my favourite.",positive
"We didn’t know much about Sri Lanka and actually we discovered Heritance Ahungalla by chance. we booked our family new year holidays for 7 days in another Yoga Resort, but when we checked in that Resort we realized this is not the place where we would like to spend our next 7 days and we decided to shift. We called few of our friends and they asked us to try Heritance Ahungulla. Due to new Year there was rush and the hotel was almost booked when we landed with luggage. We thought they might ask us exorbitant amount because of new years week. But they didn’t and gave us 3 rooms for next 7 days. We were delighted. The Resort is quite big. The lobby looks awesome and there is a huge pool right at the entrance. The staff is friendly and speaks English and Sinhalese. Rooms are clean. There are 2 swimming pools in the resort one is very big another one is comparatively small but nice. There is a small Jacuzzi also. The health club is just a formality and has nothing much to offer. There is a café where you can relax by having cup of coffee or a glass of beer near the pool side. You can have some snacks as well. For food there is a restaurant where you can have food according to there menu. For Indians again they have not much to offer if you are a hardcore Indian cuisine fan. The menu has mostly continental and European dishes and there are not many options for vegetarians. Though you will find vegetables to eat. For breakfast there is a huge buffet and you can get many options there for vegetarians as well non vegetarians. The price is on higher side when it comes to food but in any way this is Heritance. Spa is managed by an Indian lady settled in Sri Lanka with a staff of mostly Asians. It’s a good spa but again rates are high but if you negotiate hard they might give you some discounts not much but. The Spa is well equipped with Sauna and steam. There is beach behind the resort where you can go and relax and swim if you want. But there is a problem with the beach. I don’t think its owned by the resort and that’s the reason the resort cant stop locals to come on the beach. And because of that petty sellers and some snake charmers bothers you a lot when you are on the beach. The life guards and staff of Hotel try to stop locals but they cant do much about it because after all it’s a public beach. Foreigners surrounded by local people asking for money or asking them to buy something from them is common site. The resort should do something about it. There is not much activity from the resort side when it comes to children. Though they have some swimming dances classes etc but not much. So if you want some activity then you might get disappointed. The resort doesn’t have much to offer. The new years eve was good and was organized by the management. The tables were reserved on first come first serve basis and buying of wine was a must. But it was a great evening. The staff performed some great items and the new year was celebrated in a grand way. Food was good too, but again vegetarians were disappointed. The service is good in the hotel, specially the house keeping. They even clean your room twice if your tip them well (but why will you do that? unless you are very messy) The only problem I always faced during my stay in any resort/hotel around the world specially in South Asia, they don’t pay much attention to Indians. The staff also keeps you on 2nd in priority. For example, if you want to relax near a pool (everybody wants to do that because there is no other activity in the resort) so you need pool chair s or pool lounges, they are limited and mostly given to Europeans. You will see many Indians arguing for pool chair in the resort. Over all a good experience, but activates can be improved",positive
"Our worst stay in the honey moon while others Mt. Lavinia Hotel, Serene Pavilions and Heritance Kandalama being really great. Got a great beach and couple of good large pools. Service is average. Rooms are old and not impressive. Some switches are broken. Air condition control really sucks, bathroom door can not be close properly. Management should consider doing some major renovations.",negative
"Well worth travelling here from Colombo. Peace and tranquillity . Gracious service with a smile. The food was excellent . No need for a la carte as the buffet was superb, with wide cosmopolitan choice. Great place to chill out. Can't fault it , and would highly recommend .",positive
"Was at the hotel during a long weekend in February, with my family. Very relaxing atmosphere, and the staff was very polite and helpful. Lots of entertainment. Very child-friendly environment. Food was excellent.",positive
"One of four Heritance hotels we stayed in during a ten day tour. Large and has good architecture and enviable position on the beach this Hotel does lack the attention to detail that others had. No welcome drinks or towels which though not a deal breaker was noticeable because when we mentioned it the promised drinks later did not appear. The dining room was large but you were left to find out for yourself that half the breakfast buffet was in the quieter other room. Beach beds were placed by someone who seemed to feel the tired faded towels were far too precious to distribute. We had a good time but did not feel the staff overall were well motivated.We would return again to any of the others ie Kandalama, Earls Regency, and theTea Factory but would probably give this one a miss next time. Amazingly the A la Carte restaurant was not able to secure many or any takers on Valentines evening. We never felt the hotel was geared up to making guests feel special.The rooms were fine but some public areas do need a makeover. If you have a Mirror Lounge its probably a good idea to replace the rusting mirrored ceiling which detracts from the ambience.",neutral
"Taking an HSBC offer for lunch dinner and breakfast at a discounted price at Heritance Hotel, Ahungalla our visit to this hotel last weekend was to serve a purpose. We were looking for good hotel for my son, his wife and the two kids (my grand children) coming to Sri Lanka end of July this year for a week’s holiday from Germany. For my daughter in law and my grand children it would be their first visit to this Island. So it was very natural we wanted the best available resorts in Sri Lanka. Having seen and been in many hotels around the island, Heritance Ahungalla vast space, a centrally located large pool, and the entire complex so close to the sea left us little to desire. Being very health conscious I found the salad bar was more than average to keep my hunger at bay. There was a variety of hot and cold food to choose from and the restaurant staffs were very friendly serving with smiles too. I would not exaggerate a rare feature absent at most tourist hotels: Meeting helpful personnel. However, a pleasant young lady- Vishmie de Silva- made it her second nature to disprove this common notion, by answering all our questions patiently. She took time to show the different kinds of rooms and all other the facilities available at this complex untiringly with a smiling face. She promoted and convinced us this hotel is exactly what we are looking for single handedly. When she finally leaves this hotel to migrate to different country end of Feb 2013 this hotel loses a valuable asset. I also know that no one is indispensable but there are special people who leave lasting impressions on the sands of time and Vishmie does exactly this. I am certain my grand children and daughter in law would not be disappointed with their stay here at Heritance Ahungalla shortly.",positive
We really enjoyed our stay at the Heritance Ahungalla. The high quality service was evident and experienced from the moment we entered the hotel. The friendly staff were more than helpful and were ever willing to assist the guests. Their warm smiles added more value to our enjoyment of the chosen venue. The management had done an excellent job in training the staff and their friendly attitude is definitely a big bonus. The food was great catering towards international travellers without forgetting the local cuisine. The cleanliness of the rooms and the location in general is highly praiseworthy. We will definitely visit this lovely place again.,positive
"The hotels is a bit run down. beyond what i can remember and is in need of a good spruce up, But everything else was wonderful. We required an early check in but we weren't too bothered with getting the room as long as we can lounge around in the pool. However the reception staff was quick with sorting out the room. we also got a late check out. Room - was generally spacious. I wish the bathrooms were a bit more spacious though. but the room was very comfortable. Lovely view of the ocean. Food - YUM! I was craving something spicy (even though I do eat it every single day of my life) but The food was quite nice. quite a good variety and lots of options available. We decided to go with the half board option to make sure we don't really overeat :)) Pool - If you do go try to use second pool. the main pool is super hot. Not a lot of shade around the main pool area... the second pool is awesomely shaded and not too crowded and for those photo-bugs out there an ideal location. \ Pool bar - We wanted Lion beer which was declined since this was not the main pool bar but the second pool bar, so were rye bread sandwiches. the reason being we need to go to the other bar. which i thought wasn't a good enough excuse, but since we were in a relaxing mood it didn't kill our buzz Service - There was a positive and negative. However the positive is so overwhelming I don't really need to write down the negative but however it should be mentioned. When my husband and I went down for dinner we were after wine and didn't want anymore drinks, however one of the waitstaff decided to come ask us about drinks, which we politely declined. He was quite rude, he stood there pouting adn gave us a quizzical look. I was a bit taken back because I was definitely NOT expecting that. because as a customer we have the right to say no IF we do not want anything. but it seemed to be the wrong thing to do. But the positive was at breakfast I requested a bowl of ice cream to go with my waffle and Nihal the waiter (who is awesome) made that happen. I've been to quite a few places and some places have actually declined as it was not on the menu. but Nihal made that the best waffle ever! Also the hotel is quite spacious and large, well equipped with a library and games room and bars. the staff is extremely friendly and go out of their way to help. Also it was my husbands birthday so we got a cake courtesy of the hotel. which was a nice touch to an amazing day away from colombo.",positive
"The Heritance was our final stop on a lengthy trip around Sri Lanka and we went for a week of R & R with no distractions. After experiencing quite poor weather for a lot of the trip by and large the weather in Ahungalla was good and we were able to make use of the pool and grounds. We preferred to sit near the ""garden pool"" away from the organised activities and on our first day the noise of the ""beach party"" was extremely annoying. Fortunately this did not repeat but if you are after total relaxatioin you need to be aware this is a large and busy complex (actually it is much bigger than the hotels we like to stay in for R & R and we prefer a more personal service). Our trip was put together by our UK agent but we had looked at the hotel website and decided that an upgrade to a ""luxury room"" looked worthwhile. We were really glad to have done this and our room was absolutely superb with massive space, an excellent bathroom and a masive balcony on two sides of the room. We certainly enjoyed staying in it. We were booked on a ""half board"" basis so it was breakfast and dinner. The large dining room is quite nice but the low ceilings and lack of soft furnishings make it quite noisy and slightly impersonal. The buffets were quite good but not quite as imaginative as some of the other places we stayed (Grand Hotel in Numwara Eliya for example). There are several other dining options and actually it would probably have been better to have booked for B & B because the concession made for not having the ""already paid for"" buffet dinners was quite poor. For those interested there is usually some evening entertainment. Other than an occasional walk on the beach we did not step outside the complex having already been touring extensively in Sri Lanka and although some people may have been pestered by locals ""offering services"" a very firm no does the trick and you should not feel in any way concerend about offending touts - they are trying to con you!",positive
"beautiful hotel on a quiet stretch of beach. The beach had golden yellow, soft sand which was clean so was perfect for walks along the shore. The hotel pool was huge and offered ""infinity"" pool looks to the sea. Despite going on a local long weekend, the families and children did not infringe on pool use due to it's size. The hotel offered plenty of romantic dining choices from dining on the beach with lanterns surrounding the table to the ""lighthouse"". Food was tasty and service was personal and friendly. Rooms were big, clean and comfortable, each with a large balcony which looked out to the sea.",positive
"This is the place you don't want to leave. Has everything you need for a pleasant stay and a wonderful vacation. Definitely the choice! The breakfasts are very good, liked the menu and the service at the restaurant. The green territory at the hotel with the swimming pools are the place to be, very clean, the pools are great and right next to the beach. Every morning, after breakfast, we have spent at the territory. The hotel even has a library, not a big one, but for your convenience, they've placed a PC in it. The personnel is very kind and helpful.",positive
"It's what you don't see in the glossy photos and marketing blurb, but step one metre outside the hotel grounds (front/roadside or back/beachside) and you'll immediately be surrounded by local touts, who draw you into conversation with general chit-chat (Where are you from? How long are you staying?) before swiftly moving on to the HARD SELL (for tours, tuktuks, souvenirs, restaurants, etc), or muscling in on trying to carry your shopping and gathering around when you get your change in the hope of receiving some cash. In short, it doesn't make you feel like a human being; more like a walking Rupee or Dollar bill waiting to get rinsed. I am expecting the mandatory response from the hotel manager (does he really write these Trip Advisor responses?!), saying the hotel is working with the touts to improve the experience for guests... if this is true (and it seems to have been ongoing for some time), it simply is not working. A cynic would suggest the touts benefit the hotel in scaring guests into only using the hotel's services. We did this initially - a 9km taxi trip was a set hotel price of $27 return, compared to £2.50 single in a tuktuk. And the hotel taxi driver was hell-bent on taking us to a turtle hatchery, temple, Ayurveda centre, tea shop, etc. instead of where we had actually asked to go, which was exasperating. As for the hotel itself, one you get beyond the wow factor of the pools, the hotel rooms are comfortable and functional, serviced by attentive housekeeping staff. The buffet restaurant is acceptable as a day-to-day dining option and the communal areas are decently maintained. But will we be recommending the hotel or visiting it again? Sadly, the persistent pestering and hassle we encountered from the locals means the response is a resounding 'NO'.",negative
"Superb resort, large, well equipped, modern rooms all facing the sea, three restaurants, two swimming pools, nice spa, tennis courts, table tennis, very friendly staff. We were three couples all celebrating our 20th wedding anniversaries and the staff made it a point to make it a memorable holiday for us. Surprised us with cakes after dinner. The morning activities in the pool were great fun. Food is also good in all restaurants. A great hotel to spend time in. Something for everyone.",positive
"just as you enter to the hotel you see the blue pool along with beautiful sea beach, the garden the two pools makes you think what pool to jump to, walk to the room you are are there to enjoy. The food is top of the menu specially the action stations and the sea food.. you will love this place as the people really care when you are there",positive
"Our first stay here was in 1993, when it was the Triton. Subsequent stays started in 2006 (first week opening after post-tsunami refurbishment.), and every year since. Hope to return in October this year. We are not ""beach people"" but, if we're in Sri Lanka, we HAVE to stay here. NOTHING COMPARES. The people are outstanding... and that's what matters to us. The rooms and food are also excellent, but it's the people who make it special (and they know who they are).... stay there, and you will know that we are right!",positive
"Having dealt with five consecutive days of rain, the skies cleared up for our last day at the Ahungalla Heritance and it proved quite pleasant overall. The dinner buffets were delicious, lunch and breakfast as well. The hotel is also beautifully designed. Rooms were clean and service excellent, however that said the bathrooms weren't exactly spotless with some grout and mold found in the shower, still not a huge point of complaint. The swimming pools were wonderful and the hotel is right on the beach and stunning sunsets happen quite often. Ignore the touts who hang out in front of the hotel and by the sea who try to get you into their tuk tuks, restaurants and what not they weren't the most polite when we refused their services. Arrange your transport to Galle and around privately or through the hotel and you should be fine. Taxi's from Colombo should be cheap enough and they'll pick you up too. The only complaint I had was with some of the other guests; tour groups from countries I won't mention who smoked in the jacuzzi, were unhygienic in the pool, and frequented the buffet tables with plastic bags.",positive
"We spent five nights here on the beach at the end of a three week tour of Sri Lanka. At first I was surprised at its size but as occupancy was not particularly high when we were there this had little impact. Despite its size the service was efficient and very friendly. It seemed like there was a smiling helpful face round every corner and right the way up and down the chain nothing was too much trouble. Food in all the areas we ate was excellent. The couple we travelled with had their wedding anniversary whilst we were there and we booked the fine dining restaurant. We weren't disappointed. KK the catering manager found us in the afternoon and agreed a menu with us. The food was very good and Dayal and the Chef ensured it was a very memorable experience for our friends. We returned for our final night tethered and were again impressed. Wee also recommended it to others who had a similarly good experience. The rooms are standard and we had a large sea facing balcony. However I have never understood the need for some hotels, thankfully very few, to have windows between the bedroom and the en suite shower room ( there was no bath). Thankfully there were blinds which we utilised!! But Why? Also I though just leaving the en suite walls in the original grey plaster gace a dowdy unfinished look to the room. They need tiles. That apart the rooms are clean and well serviced. The hotel is right on the beach but the beach is over patrolled by pestering beach people selling there services and items. This does get annoying but there is ample space and loungers on the hotel premises for crashing out without being disturbed. The public areas are attractive and really well kept and offer plenty of areas to relax in the shade and have a drink. Overall I enjoyed the experience and the time to unwind in the sun before a return to a cold European February.",positive
"We stayed at Heritance Ahungalla for two weeks and had a really pleasent time. The staff is wonderful and very friendly. The food is delicious and diversified. And the hotel architecture is beautiful! The city of Anhungalla is rather small and not much to see but there are lots of nice daytrips that you can do from there, to Galle for example.",positive
"My husband and I arrived in Sri Lanka celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary. Land of amazing beauty. Second hotel we came to was this hotel, amazing hotel design, service and food. Strongly recommends reach the hotel.",positive
"I was so impressed with everything about this hotel. The room was beautiful, clean and very spacious. The bed was huge and comfy, even the cot for our 20 month old was the nicest we've ever had in a hotel, with a proper mattress and mosquito net. Staff were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble. We ordered from the kids menu each night for our child and they brought it to the room each time free of charge. There was a massive selection of food at the buffett to cater for every taste. Breakfast was amazing with one of the biggest selections I have seen- the freshly cooked waffles were my favourite. There are 2 pools, both are lovely. We were always able to get a pool lounger and the pools never felt busy. Only small issue was it was sometimes hard to find a pool attendent and pool towels. Overall we had such a wonderful relaxing stay and would definitely return. Tip: If you require a babysitter it would pay to try book in advance as they are limited and we were only able to get one for one of the nights.",positive
beautifully situated at the side of the sea.wonderful welcome when we arrived and that service continued throughout our 4 day stay.lovely choice of eating places.two excellent swimming pools set in lovely gardens to relax in. rooms were immaculately kept and well equipped.,positive
"Heritance Ahungalla is a beautiful property right on the beach close to Bentota. Unlike other beach resorts I have been to, one can walk directly from the infinity pool on to the beach and into the water in a couple of mins.. It has a really pretty infinity pool with an actual deep end for swimmers.. there are two pools in the hotel with one of them being very quiet, under the shade of a tree..very relaxing!! The hotel offers this amazing option of 'dine where the waves break' where they organize candlelit dinner for a couple with an exclusive table right on the beach with a 5 course meal menu. very romantic meal.. The staff is exceptionally good and takes care of the requirements of the guests. All in all a great experience, would definitely do it again!",positive
Staying here for the umpteenth time. The best thing is that you can get here from Colombo in little over an hour thx to the expressway. Despite the busy weekend the GM and his staff went out of the way to make it an exceptional great weekend for us. Will certainly be back.,positive
"This place was amazing. From our arrival we felt very welcome here. The staff were very friendly and helpful. They were always on hand to help with a smile and were immaculate in presentation. The location of the hotel is idyllic, the pool was fantastic & the room was perfectly clean and practical. The food was 5* quality, great selection to choose from and reasonable at cost. Take the buffet breakfast! You may see an elephant wandering the grounds ;) This hotel had plenty of character, there were activities going on all day & entertainment in the evenings. We even got to try scuba diving in the pool. The spa was fantastic, we had hot oil massages which were just heavenly. We were very happy with our stay here, we only stayed 2 nights - We will be back again for sure! I cannot recommend this hotel enough!",negative
"I went to heritance ahungalla in february 2013 to celebrate the birthday of one of my friends. As soon as the staff knew, they prepared a very special dinner for us 6 at the beach , with a personalised cake and a decoration of flowers and balloons. It was a very thoughtful gesture, we appreciated it so much ! thank you for making our stay so special !",positive
"Have been to Heritance Ahungalla several times and have enjoyed it every single time. Good value for money. It's a fairly large hotel with quite a number of rooms, and is always quite busy. However, service is pretty good especially, that of the reception staff. Great rooms...tastefully furnished and clean. The bathrooms are quite big too. As for food, the buffets offers quite a range of food, from local to international cuisine. One of the best things about the hotel is the access to the beach and the sea. It can get quite crowded though. Like the fact that one of the pools is accessible only to in-house guests, providing more privacy. There was entertainment in the evenings, with a band playing. The complimentary water bottles and a quick windscreen wipe when we were leaving the hotel was a nice touch and added that extra bit to our stay. Highly recommend the place.",positive
love the food.... they had a very good varity... rooms were ok.......pool was good...staff was very helpfull and responsive.love the work by J..Bawa.... its one of teh things which makes this hotel diffeent from anyother....but be careful if leave things in the beach as there are beach boys and people who steel the things you leave in the beach....sunglasses..goggles etc... beach is clean and can have long walks on the beach as it runs for miles....,positive
"In Jan 2013 I spent several wonderful days with my wife in the Heritance Ahungalle, work of one of the renowned architects J Bawa.The reception was very friendly. It's a beautiful Hotel for a pleasant stay. The rooms are large, very clean and well furnished. There is also a large pool area. Beach is clean and lovely to swim. [ staff make it happen ]The friendly staff will make sure that every guest at the pool or beach is looked after. It is glorious to eat out with the sunset.",positive
"Hotel is beautifully done up and the Rooms, Pool and Beach are Lovely. The Staff are Excellent too always very responsive, concerned & Friendly. I fell the Taste of Food can improve further to match the Hotel Setting and Buffet Prices. They had many entertainment items to keep the Guests on their feet during the Christmas holidays. We loved the ""Jackson Five"" performance. We enjoyed the privacy of the Beach and the Private Blue Pool. Rooms are maintained perfectly with daily House keeping. The place is extremely clean and safe. I would no doubt recommend the Place to friends & Corporates. Thank you Heritance!!",positive
"We decided to stay at Heritance Ahungalla during our recent trip to Sri Lanka for two reasons... 1. The taj At bentota was under renovation and 2. People generally had good things to say about it. However our experience was OK. Rooms- they are clean, decent size, comfortable beds...but they were somehow a little dull.. Otherwise the rooms were quite clean and the housekeeping generally was good. We had a beautiful view of the sea from the room Food was expensive in the fine dining restaurants.. Buffet and coffee shop were ok though. We didn't quite like the dinner buffet, the breakfast buffet was decent. Overall hotel is ok. When you enter the lobby you don't feel that this is a luxury property. Though it's clean it's really minimalistic. They say it's the geoffery bawa minimalistic design and I personally prefer less to more but This place was actually quite bare. The pool however is very picturesque,,,and very clean. The main disappointment however was the beach. The beach actually was ok .. clean and all but the ocean floor was not a gentle sloping floor like in bentota near taj. It's some thing like it will be 3 feet deep ten feet from the beach and then 1 foot deep when you go further. S it was quite scary for a non swimmer like me as I was not prepared for the sudden drop in the ocean floor. The service overall was good and very courteous. However, the fact that the housekeeping staff barges into your room once u call for a check out was something I Didn't appreciate and thought it was very rude. They knock once and use their key to enter to check the minibar. They don't hv the decency to wait till we open the door or ask them to come in. The other staff was very good. There were a lot of children at the resort and the staff was very patient with all the kids who were almost wrecking their Christmas trees and running around the buffet place like crazy",neutral
"We ended a 2 week tour of the island with 7 days here to relax before the long journey back home and relax we certainly did. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff and although it is a big hotel the service was excellent at all times. The reception area is big and airy and opens out onto one of two infinity pools which was backed by the beach and Indian Ocean. A spectacular view on arrival. The staff were extremely friendly without being overbearing and were helpful at all times especially as we had to call for a doctor at one point. We had booked a luxury room (357) which was on the far side of the hotel overlooking the second pool and whilst it was a lovely room in some senses I think most of the luxury referred to the size rather than anything else. It was actually too big! I say this because it didn't feel very relaxing. Although it had a seating area and flat screen tv everything looked lost in such a big space. Luckily for us we did a deal and moved into into a suite at the end of the corridor which was just superb. We had a separate lounge, lovely bedroom, amazing bathroom with jacuzzi and more importantly a big balcony from which to view the ocean and superb sunsets. There were plenty of sun loungers and space and the pools were big enough that they were never crowded. There are three restaurants to choose from so we avoided the buffet because the other options were so much better and more relaxing and the fine dining restaurant really is superb. The chefs here regularly enter and win awards at the chefs Olympics so that shows how good the food is. Once again, you cannot swim in the sea but the beach is lovely. You will get some of the locals wanting to sell you the usual clothes and tours but they were not too much of a problem and if you walk far enough there is a small beach cafe ( king lobster) where you can get the owners to cook you a meal or have a drink or you can walk further down the beach and see the villagers hauling in the fishing nets. It really was a lovely way to end three weeks in Sri Lanka. It's just a shame we had to leave and go home to snow!",positive
"Ahungalla Heritance can be proud of its employees. Most striking impression was their ready smile & willingness to help old without requesting for assistance. That showed their genuine willingness to help others. And food was excellent ! I would say too much of variety. Thank you Heritance, keep it up !!!!",positive
We have been to Heritance several times and in my opinion its the best beach resort in the Island. The beach is exceptional..... its not shared with tons of other hotels so you have it almost all to yourself :) Rooms are always in excellent condition and very very clean and spacious. When it comes to Food they always have a great spread and even the a la carte menu is fabulous. The most important aspect of this gem of hotel is the staff - they are ever so friendly and helpful always going out of their way to make sure you are comfortable and happy. The Staff truly are the 5th star in this hotel.,positive
"Had a fabulous stay in this beautiful hotel... Rooms and public areas all kept clean and to a very high standard. The food and drink selection in the bars and restaurants is excellent. What sets this hotel apart are the staff, every member from room boys and pool attendants through to the managers themselves are nothing but friendly and helpful, with nothing being too much bother. I thoroughly reccomend this hotel if you are considering a visit to Sri Lanka... Looking forward to returning soon",positive
"This is a stunningly beautiful hotel is in the most amazing location right on the ocean front. When we first arrived at this hotel I was overwhelmed with how amazing it was and only wish we had of stayed longer than one night! The hotel grounds are like what you see on postcards picture perfect! The room which we were in was basic though nice and very comfortable, the only disappointment was that we were on the side of the building so we didn't have front facing ocean views only a side glimpse. After reading past reviews about the bathroom not really being up to standard cleanliness wise for a 5 star residence with limescale etc. we found it to be not so bad but it could be improved on which would make a big difference! The hotel itself is quite sparse and very light and airy with several different bars located around the hotel. The food was great though my only suggestion would be to have more of a western choice at breakfast as it was mainly Asian and if your not wanting to eat curry for breakfast your very limited to what choice there was available. I would highly recommend this hotel to other travellers but try and stay longer than just one night as I didn't want to leave.",positive
"My partner and I had the most excellent and enjoyable stay at the Heritance Ahungalla.What makes this hotel special is its staff and the food.This hotel really understands the meaning of customer service. We stayed in this beautiful hotel, maintained fantastically, for 20 nights and every day we were greeted with beautiful smiling faces, the staff had the ""yes I can do"" attitude and made us feel like home.Every day was a special day due the staff and their incredible friendly manner,from breakfast to pool & bar,dinner and houskeeping staff and chefs, we were spoiled by their attentiveness and pure kindness, The food is out of this world,the variety of dishes on the buffet,the freshness of the ingredients,the presentation and the taste was outstanding,every dish tasted like heaven.To our dearest Kusum,Anushka,Jananjaya,Nelka and Aeysha in the restaurant,Madhu,Puspakumara,Waruna,Indika and Lakshitha at the pool bar,Thilina in housekeeping and Rukshan and his chefs, thank you all from the bottom of our hearts for this unforgettable stay.We truly appreciated your endeavours to make our long stay the best we ever had and for that we salute to you all and to the management for treating their staff well.In sum we highly recommend the Heritance Ahungalla to all you travellers out there,there are no worlds to describe it just go and experience it yourself.Thank you again and see you soon. Yours sincerely Izra Mannan and Frank Herrenbrueck",positive
"I love the hotel, beach and food at Heritance Ahungalle. As you walk into the hotel, the view is amazing... you see the pool and then the beach.. It's impossible to explain you just need to see it. The staff at the hotel are very friendly and greet you with a massive, welcoming smile :) The rooms are very nice and comfortable and the food is really amazing. The selection of food at lunch time is amazing! If you don't want to laze by the pool, beach, or bar which is located close to the pool, there is a verandha which is also by the pool for anyone to chill out and do whatever they want. If i'm not mistaken there are one or two games available to help you happily pass the time. The beach is sooooo soft and the sea is warm at all times and you can wade quite far in with the water being at your knee. :) Love it! Have gone there atleast 10-15 times and i still can't get enough!",positive
"My wife and I would like to share our wonderful / memorable stay at Heritance Ahungalla during this short trip. We will definitely come back for a longer stay. The team of Sampath ,Gamini and Thusara took care of us so well that we felt we were being spoilt . As I told them in the service industry this is what make the difference. I believe Heritance brand should not expand too fast and special attention should be paid to training and succession planing not forgetting staff retention . A lot of respect should be given to old staff who have been hardworking and loyal which is something I could notice in this hotel organization . Congratulations and all the best wishes. Once again a big thank you for the reception at your hotel .",positive
"It's a wonderful place folks specially if you enjoy a great pool, a good spread of food with a choice to suit all types of palates, friendly and helpful staff not only to you but also to the children. Our only hassle was the delay in getting the rooms organised though the booking was made a week or a few days before our arrival.(Mind you this was a FB booking.) Once the rooms were given the unfriendly front desk staff or member of staff was so rude in asking for the rooms when it was time to leave.We were told that we could stay on till 5 or 6pm but to give up the rooms and to stay by the pool if we liked or anywhere else !!!Ha ha It's a hotel! It's a holiday! It's your job to be hospitable. Rooms are booked by people for comfort..a home away from home, if you took back a room or two and gave us the use of one room till we checked out at 5pm that would have been better.",positive
This was our first stop of our family vacation in Sri Lanka during the Christmas break in 2012. We had given the hotel a rooming list one month prior to coming to Sri Lanka and they screwed up royally with the rooms. They had rooms all over the hotel on the second floor in both wings and it was very difficult for the family with 7 children in total to keep an eye on them as the rooms were almost 5 minutes walk from each other. They also did not have the room types as we had requested (one month prior) given to us. Some of the couple were given twin beds and the extra beds which were requested were not given at all. Food was very good here though. The property itself is a beautiful one with the pool and beahc so close to each other.,positive
"This is one of the best hotels in Sri Lanka. We spent few days there for our honeymoon and we had a wonderful time. Room was in excellent condition and I love every detail of the room. The bed was decorated with flower petals everyday when we arrived. Loved the specious toilet. To the hotel room you can see the blue sea and and you can enjoy the sound of the sea waves. Amazing. The swimming pool runs parallel to the sea/aligned with the sea, so when you look at it in a distance you feel like they are linked together. The entertainment area includes a piano, some board games, etc. The hotel was built with minimum harm to the nature, leaving all the trees as it was (you can see a lot of frangipanni trees in an open area in the middle of the hotel building) Also the garden of the hotel is so big and very interesting. Food was really good with a wide selection. Staff was friendly. Want to go back again and again. During our stay they played nice flute music (live) at night in the garden. This made the area so serine when it was mixed with the sound of sea waves, the traditional srilankan architecture, etc.",positive
"As a stand-alone resort, the Heritance Ahungalla is a great property. However, if you're looking for activities, there is not a lot nearby. The hotel itself is beautiful, a typical Jeffrey Bawa designed sprawling property. The room was very with a nice view of the beach. However, because it is a sprawling hotel, it was a bit of a walk to my room. The pool is a beautiful. It is large enough for children to play and adults to drift around without bothering each other. The buffet restaurant was just average. Most of the guests are on full board, so dine in the buffet restaurant. I dined one night in the a la carte restaurant. As I was the only customer, they set me up at a candlelit table on the beach with a private waiter. The food was excellent and it was a great experience (though a bit odd sitting by myself at a romantic, candlelit, oceanside table!) I definitely recommend it over the buffet restaurant. The spa was very good. The staff were skilled and professional (all from Bali) and the atmosphere was very relaxing. The touts on the beach were a bit annoying. Perhaps because the hotel is the only game in town, I found them more persistent that at other resorts long the coast. I took the boat tour up the river. I highly recommend it. It was a very interesting couple of hours with terrific scenery. (Besides, there's not a lot else to do in the area.) I suggest being price conscious. At the right price, this is a perfectly nice resort. However, there are other newer and better resorts along the coast so be sure to compare prices.",positive
"We spent three days at this beautiful hotel which is situated on a sandy quiet beach. The pool, the food and the general cleaniliness of the hotel cannot be faulted. The staff were exceptional. They couldnt do enough for the guests. We had a wonderful restful holiday. Perhaps the two areas that could be improved are - a) the evening entertainment needs to be improved especially as there is nothing available outside the hotel. Something as simple as having a cinema room would help b) the wifi is very unrealiable, which can be frustrating. Overall, very happy with our time at the hotel. M.J",positive
"Our stay in this hotel was most enjoyable. All staff worked hard to make our holiday enjoyable. Our room was very comfortable with a sea view. The hotel, grounds and pools are well designed, particularly the main pool. The team of pool attendants are the most helpful I have ever encountered in any hotel in the world. I would certainly recommend this hotel however there is one issue I would suggest the hotel management team consider and that relates to noise from the pool activities and the lounge bar. The hotel has two pools - the one in front of reception is the one seen in all their promotional materials and is beautiful. However, it gets very noisy as a result of very loud music associated with activitites in the pool including aqua aerobics. This mirrors the experience of another reviewer jennymartyn. There is a second pool on the property which is not quite as stunningly beautiful but is still a nice pool. However, the noise from the main pool travels and that spoiled our enjoyment on a couple of occaisions. We prefer to listen to the sound of the waves on the beach and the noise of the birds in the trees not head-banging noise from aqua-aerobics and beach based activities. A big thank you to staff including reception staff (can't remember all their names), Vishme (guest relations), housekeeping and pool staff for trying so hard to meet our needs.",neutral
"Great location, nice property on a lovely beach! We spent 4 days after driving for a week through the pearl island and it was the perfect place to chill and unwind. On the downside, I feel the rooms should have been bigger and the glass walled bathrooms need better blinds!! That said, we had a swell time in this super resort!",positive
"We have just spent over a week at the much vaunted Geoffrey Bawa designed Heritance Hotel. We enjoyed our week on the coast but find it tough to rate the hotel better than average. No doubt in its day the hotel would have been considered ahead of its time however today its minimalist design and decor highlight the fact that hotel is getting tired. The rooms have apparently been renovated recently and they are OK however the public areas are uninspiring. We visited a number of hotels on the coast while in the area. It was noticeable how many are either new - Chaaya at Hikkaduwa or recently upgraded - and Surf and Avani at Bentota, or in the process of being renovated - Vivanta by Taj at Bentota. The latter, based on the upgrade we saw to date, is going to be fantastic. The Heritance will need to watch its competition. The beach is nice once you've been rude to the touts to keep them off. Tourist information is not readily available and most things you'll want to do are away from Ahungalla. We got most information and help in getting around from the on site taxi drivers who can arrange pretty much anything including motor bike hire which despite the local traffic we would recommend. Tuk Tuk drivers outside the hotel are bad news - rude and argumentative which we didn't find anywhere else. Finally the hotel entertainment is amateurish. At +US350 a night it wasn't cheap for what it is.",negative
"We were really looking forward to a relaxing stay here after a busy touring holiday but feel disappointed. When we arrived there was a beach disco party starting and the noise was deafening. This was followed by an aquerorobic session played at full volume, we have not stayed at such a noisy place ever! Tonight is Russian Xmas and we have two lots of noise, from the disco and the lounge bar! My advice? Bring ear plugs! Our room is fantastic and of you were staying with a large group or family and friends it would be great, but I don't think we will be back",negative
"Unless your dream holiday is to sit by a pool all day with staff continually at beck and call this isn't for you. There is very little to do around the hotel unless you have a car or a driver. we found ourselves getting rather bored of it, quite quickly. The hotel is on a stunning sandy beach but you cannot swim in the sea, and the areas round the two pools are full of Russians with money to burn. I don't like customers being rude to staff but saw plenty of this. However staff accepted it due to massive tips and pretty much ignored everyone else. Food in the hotel was good and rooms were clean but wouldn't go back. The whole hotel was pretty impersonal with massive long white corridors which reminded me of Victorian hospitals. This hotel was the final one on our trip so we only stayed two nights, which for us was one night too many. As I said in my intro the hotel was perfect if you want to spend all day on a sun lounger but it didn't suit us.",negative

"Beautifull hotel, clean rooms and terretory, friendly people. Great beach view. All rooms with a sea side. Tasty food (we took only breakfasts). Near the hotel you may find fish resturant with great dishes. Unfortunatly ocean isn't for swiminning near the ocean, because of dangerous ocean (big waves and underwater swirls).",positive
"For the layabout to do nothing, the fitness fanatic to be at peak, the gourmet to garner all the delights or the holiday maker in search of serenity, there is one place in Sri Lanka all rolled into one. That is the five-star Heritance at Ahungalla, where the blue ocean kisses the sand and the swimming pool stands between the airy reception area. This may sound like a leaf from a flyer or an advertisement. It is not. That’s my experience during a week-long stay at the luxury resort. The absence of what seems an orchestrated hustle and bustle in some of the resorts, being left alone from the taunting touts on the beach and caring of the staff made all the difference. I fell in love with what I saw and what I enjoyed. The buffet meals for breakfast, lunch and dinner had a wide variety to choose from – a cross section of the most popular Sri Lankan cuisine and a widespread selection of western and continental food. That is not to mention the fine dining restaurants. If you need to learn a little more, go beyond what the glossy magazines and flashy advertisements on websites say. I did that. The tins, bottles, corrugated boxes and other degradable items do not go waste. There is a team to sort them to be re-cycled. An award winning Chef, Dimuthi Kumarasinghe finds no space on the walls of his room or his tables to place any more awards including trophies. They are full. Ask him to give you what they call an “indigenous meal.” It’s a three course lunch or dinner with produce including catch of the sea within a radius of five kilometres from the hotel. I told Manager Refhan N. Razeen that I was pampered. “That is our style,” he said. So, if you also want to be pampered in southern Sri Lanka, Heritance is the resort. Don’t believe me. Have a go, try it.",negative
we had a fantasitc time. Staff is really friendly and food is great. We relly like the beach and summing pool. It was very relaxiing. weather is fabulous. We wish we had more time to enjoy the weather and entertainments. We wii be back when we come next time to Sri Lanka.,positive
"Nothing prepares you for that magical feeling that you experience as soon as you enter this place. As a practice I generally look up the hotel and I must say the pictures just fall short in projecting the beauty of this property. The reception is located on the banks of the swimming pool and the pool is on the shore i.e. where the pool ends the sea begins and there is also a wonderful antique chair placed just at the end of the pool where once can sit for hours together. The rooms are nice and we got a sea facing room, it was neat with all the amenities in place. The food though needs improvement especially for vegetarians. We are pure vegetarians and there were not many options but the view of the sea more than makes up for the lack of good food especially for sea lovers. Overall, very good place to stay.",positive
"It was a last minute deal I got for an offer from HSBC Credit Card and i decided to stay at the Heritance Ahungalla, It was a wonderful experience. 2 Large Swimming pools which can accommodate many. The Sand on the Beach is so soft and golden. Very nice to walk on the beach. The Staff are very courteous and Friendly. Nice food spread. if you are traveling with kids, There is a kids club with very professional animators to look after the kids. They do face paintings, teach kids to draw and many more.",positive
"Staying right now in this property, very good service, given welcome drink, have a sea view room facing the 2nd pool. nicely decorated room, but was disappointed with food, could hard find decent food, unfortunately we r pure Vegetarians, felt the buffet dinner was too pricy as we were not too hungry, went to the one of the restaurants, and could find only 1 or 2 veg dishes. we chose the spaghetti Napolitana, was cold, and was like spaghetti dipped in tomato ketchup and too pricy. every thing else is very good. i think if they want to achieve a 6 star rating then they have to improve food quality and would have to cater both non - veg and veg equally. i only hope the breakfast is good !!!!!!",positive
"We just stayed at the Ahungalla Heritance Hotel at Ahungalla near Bentota..A super hotel with a breathtaking waterbody..followed by reception...huge pool & as the pool ends,the ocean begins...terrific symmetry & a wow factor to the view...The beach was good too & so was the food..almost everything was worth making your holiday very exciting...",positive
this truly was the best hotel i stayed in Sri Lanka... amazing pools ( 2 of them) and great rooms .. we got a sea facing room & it was class ( only thing... the TV used was still an archaic CRT) good service & food options were great even for veg,positive
"Stayed there for 5 days with a group of 83 PAX. Great Staff always friendly and helpful. The hotel is a bit old on the outside, however is the best you can find in the area. The beach despite it's rough sea on that time, was really nice! The rooms were nice and spacious, the buffet restaurant was good with a big variety of choices. On the overall everybody enjoyed their stay. Really nice, i would definitely return again! Roberto",positive
Location wise this hotel is located on a beautiful stretch of untouched beach. The hotel has lovely rooms and the staff are amazing! We dinned on the beach with incredible food by their celebrity chiefs. We stayed for 3 days and truly relaxed. This is by far my favourite hotel in Sri Lanka.,positive
"After a week of touring around Sri Lanka for the first part of our honeymoon we were looking forward to spending a week by the sea in a 5 star resort. Unfotunately we were very disappointed with this hotel. The good points about the hotel are the large swimming pools and the view of the sea from most parts of the hotel. The bad points are numerous: -During our stay the weather was very windy and it rained heavily. The hotel is not designed to cope heavy rainfall as it is designed in a very modern, open minimalist way. All the corridors, a bar and the cafe are completely open to the elements. This meant that rain was constantly pouring in and the floors were several centimetres deep in some places. This made the floors very slippy and we found we were unable to get around the hotel much and it made sitting in the front bar and cafe impossible as the bar does not have any front covers to keep the rain out. The staff are constantly sweeping the water away and moving furniture around out of the rain which was very irritating. The overall cleanliness of the hotel is not that great either and the hotel is starting to look rundown. The bathroom in our room had lots of mould in the shower(picture attached), and there was no bath option, you have to pay for a premium top floor room to get a bath! Having stayed in many 5 star and 4 star hotels all over Europe and Asia, I would say this is a 3 star at best, the other 3 star hotels we stayed in during our holiday were in fact much better. -The food is boring and pricey by Sri Lankan standards although you would expect that in a 5 star hotel. We went to the fine dining restaurant one night which was pretty good, although very run-of-the-mill options such as steak and mash. The desserts were interesting but after waiting over half an hour, when they arrived they were poorly executed and my dessert was not even what I ordered. Being the only other couple in the restaurant this was certainly not what we expected. The breakfast is also disappointing, the only positive being the traditional Sri Lankan curries offered. The omelette queue was impressive every morning and that only left under-cooked waffles, anaemic chicken sausages and fatty bacon cooked to order. The rest of the buffet was luke-warm at best. The fresh fruit offered however was fesh and ripe and there was lots of choice. -The beach is not for swimming or being on for any length of time. There are local people constantly waiting on the edge of the hotel and the beach trying to sell you things aggressively and stray dogs wandering about do not make you feel safe. The security guards do nothing about the sellers and leave them to shout at you whilst you are lying on sunbeds within the hotel grounds. -Another point to make is that there is nothing to do in the local area- we went to the 'turtle hatchery' before going to the hotel and it took us 10min to look at the 2 ponds in which 2 poor adult turtles are kept, and a small area of sand where the eggs are buried before they hatch. We ended up leaving early as we were fed up with the food, not being able to go on to the beach and the inefficient staff. Wish we had gone to the Maldives!",negative
"We stayed in this hotel while we were on vacation in Sri Lanka. Me , my wife and two little fellows enjoyed our stay thoroughly in here. Room was big and clean with a very good view at the pool and sea. Checking in was very smooth and staff were wonderful and always treated us with a smile. Best feature of the hotel was the infinite pool which was really clean and enjoyable where all of us spend most time in. Restaurants were good and staff service was so good that you feel that you have your own butler in there. There was wide variety of food and Sri Lankan dishes were really nice. Whole experience was a very good one and we would recommend this to anyone visiting the beautiful island.",positive
"We stayed at the Heritance Ahungalla towards the end of our tour around Sri Lanka, having stayed at two other Heritance Hotels (Kandalama and Tea Factory). We were looking forward to a relaxing three days... Firstly, the positives...We were upgraded to a beautiful suite, which was one of the best rooms we had during our tour. The room had a comfy bed, a large flat-screen tv (with seating in front), and a huge, luxurious bathroom. The whole room was kept scrupulously clean thoughout by our friendly ""room boy"". Breakfast was the usual buffet (including excellent dosas). The staff at breakfast were friendly and offered us different teas to the usual. The hotel has two pools...the residents' pool was generally quiet. The other pool (in front of the reception area) was busier, and was somewhat blighted by the beach sellers (more on that later!). So, the negatives...Looking at the hotel's website, they seem to be badging it as a luxury-style resort...hmmm, well sadly, we found it a bit lacking: The food was rather average compared to the offerings in the other Heritance hotels we 'd stayed at. Elsewhere we had good quality, creative snacks when we fancied a change to Sri Lankan food (for example excellent club-style sandwiches, items for sharing etc). Here, there selection was a bit mundane. We only found out that there was a veggie menu when we had a chance discussion with a staff member...there was no mention of this in the in-room pack, or displayed in the restaurants. This really does need to be made clearer. Also, the veggie menu is available 24hrs in the cafe/bar, but apparently isn't routinely available for room service! We had a couple of frustrating phone calls trying to order from it...we called at 5.15pm and were told to call back after 6pm..and when we did call, were told to call back again at 7pm! We also ate in the cafe/bar, but one order was not as described on the menu (chop suey with pad thai turned out to be sloppy veggies with a small pile of rice). The rice with veggie curries were delicious, but there were so many flies it put us off (we appreciate that its not unusual to get flies when effectively dining alfresco, but it was a bit much when I turned to spoon some more curries and half had flies in them (surely a cover would have been sensible?)). Although the resident’s pool was generally quiet, we were disturbed a couple of times by people trying to sell stuff (the resident palm reader and vendor of wooden items which could be purchased from the other pool). And finally, our biggest complaint....the beach is effectively a no-go area due to sellers of sarongs, tours and local hoteliers trying to pursuade residents to visit their hotel for dinner and spa treatments etc. These people were relentless and aggressive in their tactics, following tourists along the beach, and would not take no for an answer if you made the mistake of venturing onto their patch (ie. step off of the grass onto the sand). We even witnessed them shouting to people sunbathing around the pool. We feel this could be an amazing hotel, but it is rather average at the moment...",positive
"We stayed at the Heritance Ahungalla for 2 nights at the end of October. The hotel is on the Ahungalla Beach near Bentota and is a scenically beautiful and spacious property. The view from the lobby of the pool and the sea - unbeatable!! First day it was raining quite a bit so could not enjoy the pool and beach to the fullest... the red flags were always up at the beach and apparently the sea is not very swim worthy for novices. Second day thankfully the sun was out and we could paddle around a bit in the sea and the pool. Lovely pool!! Food at the hotel - what we had for dinner one day was fine, the breakfast is fairly good too. Spa - my husband tried it out - and he said it was very very good. The rates are fairly expensive though and we ended up paying almost as much as we would in Dubai for a similar massage! Rooms - We had a mix up with reservations and so finally landed up paying much more than the going rate (20% off rack rate) and this was sad. Paid more than what was the current rate for a premium room for a deluxe room, and got ""upgraded"" to a premium room. Reservations tried to help but since we had booked through an external agency they couldnt help much. So I guess for all of you out there - please try a couple of time on their direct reservations site first!! Rooms continued - Lovely sea view from the premium room, but housekeeping needed to be called in as i felt the room was not too clean. Also the drain in the bathroom was smelling and they came by and put some cinnamon oil and covered the drain with a towel!! All in all it was a nice stay, but i would look for another option near bentota or hikkaduwa before I return to the Heritance Ahungalla.",positive
"We stayed at this hotel for a week at the end of a touring holiday in Sri Lanka. It is claimed to be the only five-star hotel on this coast, which is not entirely accurate. In some aspects the hotel is very good - the two huge swimming pools, large public areas, well spread-out accommodation & nicely-appointed rooms - and deserves its five stars. However, there are some aspects which are not five-star and were a source of irritation during our stay. For example, on the whole, the food was very good but tended to be served not very hot, and is rather expensive for what it is. We tried the buffet, which is OK, but very expensive. We had several meals in the Coffee Shop, which is more reasonable in price but, despite being a la carte, we twice had to send food back because it was virtually cold. Getting things like that fixed, which would happen promptly in a real 5-star hotel, seemed to take an age. Service is helpful & charming, but inept and inefficient at times. There often seems to be no-one on duty with sufficient authority to make a decision about things. Complaints are handled by constantly referring them to some-one else, who often is not in a position to actually do anything, other than telling someone else. The staff are not very quick to clear up after the rain sweeps into the public areas (which are tiled) leaving very slippery surfaces around for too long. Overall we enjoyed our stay at the hotel, but I think they could try harder to merit their 5-star tag.",neutral
"Stayed in the Heritance Anhungalla for six nights in September. It is a smart stylish hotel designed by Bawa, Sri Lanka's foremost architect. Some may find it a bit stark and white, we loved it. The rooms were large with a lot of character; comfortable beds and a very diligent roomboys. Food in the main restaurant was buffet style with lots of choice and some interesting Sri Lankan dishes. Prices are a bit on the high side, there is a cheaper restaurant but the menu was limited. There are two pools, one is reserved for reidents, they have weekend visitors who can use the other pool. It is quite a large hotel but still got a bit crowded when they had a convention at the weekend. There are fabulous sunsets out to sea. The beach is heavily occupied by traders, the ladies have some good scarves and sarongs at cheap prices, guys want to sell you a boet ride or visit the restaurant down the beach. Some of our party did and found it very good and cheap. The beach boys are very polite, as are all Sri Lankans that we met and if you say you just want to be quiet and don't want to talk they leave you alone. The beach drops sharply into the sea and waves were popwerful so bathing is banned. This is one of the drawbacks of the hotle. The other problem is that there is nowhere to walk outside the hotel, if you venture out of the gate swarms of helpfull people appear! I think it's a great hotel for three or four nights, we got a bit bored after that.",positive
"The hotel's right by the Galle Road (A2) about 75km down South from Colombo. Had to drive around a bit (within the hotel premises) to find a place to park the car. Checking in took sometime as well. The hotel's interior is aesthetically designed. It's got two big swimming pools. One is near the lobby. The other is in a more secluded place; making it the better option. We got a Premium room on the 3rd floor with a balcony which overlooked the sea. The room was well appointed with a comfortable bed, flat panel TV, spacious wardrobe and safe. The rain shower-head in the bathroom was great. However, noises from the corridor could be heard in the room. Better soundproofing would've been great. Also, the door did not have a chain-lock; which we were surprised to find out in a star class hotel such as this. The food was excellent! Great choice at the buffets and tasty food you really can enjoy. We also made a trip to a turtle hatchery nearby in Kosgoda just a few kilometres away. The hotel staff helped us locate this place. It's at the end of a road that runs by the Kosgoda Police station. In short, Heritance Ahungalla is a great sun & sand hotel with truly star-class food.",positive
An excellent experience where food served was extremely delicious (particularly the breakfast menu). We stayed at luxury rooms which were good but nothing exceptional to really 'wow' us over. The staff at Heritance were very courteous and friendly. They were also flexible in all our requests. Had a great time while at the hotel and would recommend it to anyone.,positive
"The hotel looked amazing when we arrived and we were upgraded to a fantastic suite which we were very happy with. The beach was long and wide however the sea is rough so don't expect to do too much swimming in there. Having stayed in a few other Heritance hotels during our visit to Sri Lanka we were pretty expectant when it came to the food at Heritance Ahungalla if nothing else, but we were let down here. There was not enough to choose from which was our main issue. Another bug bear was how the hotel allowed women in niqabs to swim in the hotel pools, not the type designed to be worn for swimming which of course I have no issue with. Despite these relatively small complaints we had a very relaxing stay and would recommend the hotel.",neutral

"Fantastic spacious room with a balcony and a view. Lots of menu options to choose your dining experience. Great pool area with bar, beach and sun lounges, a real focal point. There was a cultural show in the evening that meant there was no real need to leave the resort. Staff were helpful and attentive but the sheer size of the resort meant that it felt large and impersonable at times especially when you want something from your room during the day. Outside the hotel there is not much on the street front but the beach is pretty. On a personal note I found the wi-fi login system problematic which was disappointing as I had hoped to contact my husband at home and email some photos through. Otherwise it was a fantastic place to spend our last couple of days in Sri Lanka.",positive
"I liked the food it was really good with the actions station in the night. Such variety I have only seen from the likes of Hotel Kandalam. Sometimes though they had not labelled all the items such as the sushi section and the various sauces that go with sushi were not palced at the same spot. Also the room was way too small, i would call it a bit stuffy as there was no space to move around with the mini bar/tv stand and the baby cot also in our room. But even for a couple the room is small. I did like their swimming pool routine and they got everyone invloved in the pool. The playgrounds are further down the hotel, but the pathway leading to the playground had a lot of weeds and not clean. Overall the food and the accomodation was very good, I would recomend it. Also there were two swimming pools which was excellent. Both the pools do not have separate baby pools, so you have to keep a close watch on your kids if you don't want them to enter the deep end.",positive
"Mais nous donnerions un fort indice de satisfaction à cet hôtel. Chambre plus que confortable, avec vue sur la mer (sans avir payé de supplément), sdb somptueuse avec musique douce, attentions nombreuses (2 x corbeilles de fruits, gâteau pour mon annif, ...), piscines toutes deux somptueuses (celle plus isolée étant dun graphisme génial avec cet arbre qui la recouvre en partie), restaurant buffet de très grande qualité, .... Il reste que sur la plage on vous propose tout et n'importe quoi, des tissus en passant par la drogue, la prostitution, ou plus simplement des excursions. Passez un accord avec le premier qui vous accoste et les autres vous laisseront tranquille. Plage en fort dévers (abimée par le tsunami), et hôtel relativement isolé (mais tout est vite accessible en fait). Rien à dire du service 5 étoiles, et rafraichissement des facades en cours. De quoi passer d'excellents moments en fait....bonnes vacances.",positive
"we reached the heritance after having a tour of galle fort ,we were offered welcome drink and proceeded to our rooms .grand sea view and attached pool with well equipped gym.after having a swim session in the pool we had our dinner ,very authentic food and reasonably priced.dinner and music....a deadly combination.in the morning we played beach volleyball ,and then had buffet breakfast..sumptuous.then we had an appointment for shirodhara....oil massage,oh it was heavenly man.then we visited deval devi temple .it is most beautiful beach resort",positive
It was my first visit to Sri Lanka and this was the best ever experience had in my life. We had a warm welcome on Arrival and the reception staff handled us extreemly well. I went with my kids and they were not willing to leave the hotel and wanted to stay with Vishmie & Amenca... That was our dream Holiday. Restaurant service was awsome. You will be able have good breakfast but same spread every day. Coffee Shop and upper room food is average but they were willing to serve what we like. Rooms need a refurbishment need to improve on cleanlines of the rooms. Spa was good.. pool show was fantastic... Overall it was a fantastic relaxing Holiday. Hat off to Front Desk & Restaurant staff who looked after us like their family members.,positive
"Stayed here for 2 nights as part of a tour around southern Sri Lanka. The positives: Large pool Very helpful staff Well appointed room - large bathroom The negatives are more numerous and sadly affected the enjoyment of our stay. There were about 8 locals hanging around on the beach outside the hotel for the whole time on both days. They were very aggressive in the way they would wait for you to leave the safety of your hotel sun-lounger, and try and sell you everything under the sun. Just be firm and say nothing else other than 'NO!' If you engage them in conversation, they will pester you ALL DAY. We saw others suffer as a result of this and the hotel must do something about it. Worse still, there are sellers operating within the hotel itself, pestering you for palm readings and the purchase of overpriced wooden ornaments. The hotel management need to realise that the hotel should be a refuge from some of the hard-sell that exists out in the surrounding towns. Also the hotel did not seem particularly clean, and the food was distinctly average at both the Upper Room restaurant, and the 24-hour restaurant. There was some renovation work going on, but I didn't let it effect my overall view as all hotels need to do it at some point. Normally hate to be too critical, but there are some issues that need to be addressed before this one can call itself 5 Star.",neutral
"Pros - great view of the ocean (sea view avaiable with Premium rooms0 - speacious clean rooms - good size pools (note there are two pools, and one is mostly only offered to foreigners) - good spread for buffet (but its almost the same everyday for bfast) Cons - teriible reception/front desk service; had a don't care attitude and were often rude - had electrical problems in the room when the fan was turned on but even after informing the reception twice (on two seperate days), they did nothing about it..did not even apologise or offer to change the room - requested king/queen bed but were only given twin mattresses - no bath tubs, this is only available in luxury rooms - Not much choice for in-room dining - Don't visit during the weekends; the hotel allows far too many groups to have the spend the day on the weekends (allowing one or two groups is fine but there should be a limit so that the pools are not over crowded); My personal opinion is that the hotel treated foreigners differently to the locals (including locals from overseas); with the locals, they just didn't care. Me and my husband are Sri Lankans and we visit Sri Lanka often and like to escape out of colombo for a few days. We were really disappointed with the way they treated us. I think i've had far better service in other hotels in the area (bentota etc). Great hotel but would not recommend due to the horrible service.",negative
"We stayed at Heritance for 5 days and it was a great vacation overall. The room was spacious with a great sea view, the breakfast buffet had delicious food every day, the pool was refreshing and the staff was nice and friendly. The only downside is the amount of flies everywhere! I felt like I had to guard my food and drink every time or else the flies will dive in your plate and glass. There are restaurants outside the hotel which I highly recommend. There is a lagoon at the residential area which I encourage everyone to visit since it’s difficult to swim at the beach due to the heavy waves. Just be a bit careful as the vendors at the beach can be very aggressive and annoying when they are forcing you to buy stuff that you don’t need. Nonetheless Sri Lanka is a very beautiful country and it’s hard not to enjoy the scenery and food.",positive
The hotel looks stunning offers great views.We had booked the premium rooms sea facing. We found the service lacking in all aspects.From the rooms check in to the restaurant service. We were quite displeased with the hotel. I had planned a surprise for my husband and had requested the hotel for a cake and for the room to be decorated and offered to pay extra for the same. I had called and re-confirmed this more than three times. I had called in even three hours before check-in to ensure this is done. I was assured it would be done before we arrived. We came to the hotel and the front desk staff intimated that they never received any such request. Since it was a surprise it turned out to be quite a spoiler. Though the room was nice. We were given one with twin mattresses. We had to repeatedly request for a change in room with at least a queen mattress.(So much for an anniversary). We were told the hotel was running full.So we would be given a room change the next day.It never happened.Quite disappointing. Even the service in the restaurant was appalling none of the waiters bother to even keep the cutlery on the table after we have taken out plates or serve us even drinking water we had to repeatedly request for it.Being a 5-star hotel we were surprised at the dismal service. I might not consider the property again solely for the lack of service. Also the restaurants lack a choice of vegetarian food. especially the fine dinning restaurants does not serve any vegetarian food. even on request.We we forced to use the buffet every time.Which also has limited options.Disappointed again. We would not recommend this to others.,negative
"We spent three nights at this beach resort after 5 days touring Sri Lanka and staying at a number of different Heritance hotels. We were ready for some rest and relaxation and certainly received it here. We had a room with a window overlooking the ocean. Unfortunately the ocean was too rough to swim in at the time of year we visited. They had two lovely pools. We enjoyed the smaller pool which was quieter as the main pool attracted more families with children. The al la carte menu in the restaurant was very reasonably priced and the breakfast buffet had plenty of choices. The staff were very friendly and overall our stay was pleasant despite some rude, aggressive guests.",positive
"We have stayed at Heritance Ahungalla twice now, and loved it both times. The hotel is beautifully designed and airy with well appointed rooms. The beach is lovely, except for the occasional hawker that can be somewhat insistent. The breakfast buffet is superb. The extensive ""international"" (read: hotch potch) dinner buffet was not appealing, and we opted to have local food at their open air cafe, where we were served great food by lovely staff. (A note to all Sri Lankan hotels: Please have more local food items on your menus!!!!)",positive
"We stayed at the hotel for 2 nights during the 2nd week of August. Took the new Southern Express Tollway to get there and was amazed at how the relaxing the dirve was compared to the Galle Road which we have driven through in the past which used to be a trying experience. The GRO greeted us and offered us a choice for the welcome drink (Watermelon, Orange and coconut water) and also a refreshing cold wet towel which was most welcome as the humidity was pretty high that day. The hotel pool which can be seen from the time you get off the car is absolutley fantastic and overlooks the ocean. We were upgraded to higher level room which gave us a pool view as well as a partial sea view. The lighting in the room was decorative and as I've always noticed in most hotel globally too dim during the night. Why the designers of hotels allover think that mood lighting has to be dim I will never fathom. The food (we were on HB basis) in the retaurant was fabulous and they had a western as well as Sri Lankan choice. We had lunch on 2 days from the speciality restaurant on a la carte and that too was excellent. The choice of wines is limited as expected in a 3-4 star hotel of that standard. The beach was quite nice although the sea was quite choppy on both days due the season we were told. The hotel has limited activities compared to a 5 star hotel in the city but this is to be expected as one goes to these type of resort hotels only to enjoy the beach and pool. The hotel does have a 2nd pool but we did not use it as it was 1.7m depth all round and was too deep for my 2 kids and also had a lot of leaves fallen in du to the close proximity of large trees along the pool. The service was quite good but could also be attributed to the fact that we were staying during the week where the occupancy is lower than compared to the weekends.",positive
My husband and I had amazing stay at the Heritance Ahungalla ( previously known as the Triton Hotel). The service was excellent and the view from the hotel was breathtaking! The dinner buffet was rather average but the breakfast buffet made up for it!,positive
In my view this is the equivalent of a 3 star hotel in the UK (not 5 star) as positioned. Having waited over 2 hours to be shown to our rooms we opted not to stay. 1. Old food was left outside rooms. 2. the main pool in all the photos is public ( paying a lot of money for this) 3. it would appear that an entire wing of the hotel is being held up by scaffolding 4. our rooms smelt of drains. 5. they got the lunch order wrong!,neutral
"Heritance took us by suprise in the first look with a no frill lobby were one could see the pool and the view of the beach as you get off the car before the reception!!!!!!!! advice get as many books as you can for this holiday great place for readers as there is not to be done in the area so preferred to stay in the hotel with the two pools, great food, great hospitality. other than that Bentota/ Ahungalla doesnt have much to offer.",neutral
"The Heritance Ahungalla is a lovely beach hotel directly on the Indian Ocean, with the lush, tropical forest enroaching onto the beach itself. It is simply stunning. I went at the end of the monsoon season in late August, which is technically the off season. As a result, the hotel didn't put on any of the nightly entertainment (discos on the beach, clubbing by the pool etc) or daytime sports activities (volleyball and aerobics on the beach, aqua aerobics in the pool) and that actually suited me much better as I enjoyed calm, serene peace and quiet the whole time! The rooms are beautiful with quaint decor and gorgeous balconies. The pool is fantastic and although we couldn't swim in the sea due to the season, we still hung out on the beach and dipped out toes in the water. The lifeguards were constantly on duty, keeping a discreet eye on us and making sure we didn't wander off too far down the beach. We did go for a long walk with one of the locals and he took us into the area where some of the homes were destroyed by the tsumani. We also bought sarongs and saris off local women on the beach. The hotel doesn't let them come into the pool area but doesn't ban from the beach entirely, which still allows them to be involved in the whole tourism experience in the country, which is only fair after all. We did an incredible river safari about 30 mins drive from the hotel which was one of the major higlights of my trip to Sri Lanka and I would recommend it to anyone. We also arranged for a tuk tuk to take us to the turtle hatchery (around 20 mins drive away) and the nearby spice garden in Bentota. The staff were very polite and attentive, in particular the pool staff. The hotel in the main buffet restaurant was excellent with plenty of choice. My only gripe would be that the room service food isn't very good and the poolside food isn't great either, but I suppose it's fine if you're ordeirng for kids who want simple things like chips and cheese sandwiches. I would definitely recommend sticking to the main dining hall!",positive
The rooms are very beautiful and very clean. The staff was excellent and very helpful. The beach was lovely with big waves and fairly clean. The pool area was big and relaxing. Food was awesome with lots of varieties. We had a lovely time here. I recommend this hotel to any one who would love to experience the south cost of Sri Lanka.,positive
i fell in love with their food. rooms were really nice and clean. we got sea view. and it was very relaxing. friendly staff. great view. two big pools. beach is clean but we could not enjoy that since its off season.we enjoyed our stay a lot.,positive
"Rooms are beautiful, Balcony with see view. Both pools are great. Friendly staff always with a smile. Beach is clean but this is the rough season. Nothing to say about the food. it was marvelous. Chef doing a great job. we enjoyed our stay. Thanks a lot",positive
"Been here twice now and each time was wonderful. Beautiful location facing the beach. Inviting pool. Staff attentive. The rooms are superb..especially if you get them facing the pool or the ocean. Very relaxing...something for everyone.. My kids aged 5 and 8 enjoyed swimming...there are two pools...horse back riding was offered through the hotel. There is also a volleyball net...guests got together to form teams. Also pool tables and lots of lounging spots. Food at the hotel was scrumptious...buffet included a full Sri lank an spread as well as international cuisine. Only 2 hrs or less from Colombo, so a great relaxing weekend away. Highly recommended.",positive
"After a tiring drive the hotel is a refreshing site. the pool across the reception is soo inviting that first thing you want to do is ""to dive in'. nice comfortable rooms, overlooking the sea. The service was phenomenal and staff very warm and willing to go the extra mile. You can spend days without stepping out of the hotels, but if you must there is ample to do around. The hotel food is awesome, with world cuisine and local delicacies both cooked to perfection. awesome experience.",positive
We stayed two lovely nights at this wonderful hotel where everything is done to make you feel at home. The rooms are beautifully decorated. Nothing is missing. A lot of attention is paid to the details. Staff take time to listen to you and are always at your disposal. The food is very good. Thank you very much !,positive
Attended a wedding here and the place is amazing. Great food pricey drinks. Lovely public areas and an awesome infinity pool. Would recommend for a wedding they were very attentive and the service given was second to none,positive
We had our Residential work shop at the Hotel premises for two days. They have arranged everything very smoothly and the staff were extremely helpful. The duration was Lunch to Lunch (4 Meals). They had very good varerty in the food and we never felt bored with all. Rooms were very comfortable and all the equipments were working with out any issue. Room Service also was good.,positive
"The long driveway leading to the entrance provides a glimpse of what awaits guests - a stunning, large infinity pool with the ocean in the background. Not sure about the welcome nibble of a mix of sugar, cummin and coriander seeds on a bed of betel leaves but a choice of three fruit drinks reflected the class of hotel. Menus for ice creams and cocktails were another clear indication of the luxuries in store. While not a great fan of the Geoffrey Bawa style of design - long, relatively bland corridors that gave the interior a rather cold, sterile feel - the rooms are well appointed with those overlooking the beach providing a private balcony with tabel and chairs. We couldn't complain about the service over our two day stay except for a delay in getting our bags from our rooms on departure. All staff we met were friendly and ready to help. The range and quality of food was what we'd become accustomed to on our holiday on the island - fantastic! Free access to a gym and a lovely beach, as well as the pools, provided plenty of opportunity to work off the calories in time for the next sitting. Yes, the ubiquitous hawkers are ever ready to accost you as soon as you step forth on the public beach (I understand hotels are not allowed to privatise these areas) but they understand English and a couple of friendly but firm words of rejection should prevail. After all, everyone needs to try and make a living. I cannot comment on the value as this stay was part of a 11-day package tour but the experience of my family (which included three typically-demanding Gen Y'ers!) was that we'd happily return there. I'd give it 4 and a 1/2 stars if the option was available,",positive
"Beautifully designed hotel, stylish and contemporary feel, with simple furnishing using lots of wood, slate and polished plaster in the bathrooms. The view of the sea was blocked by trees in the first room I was shown, so I upgraded to a deluxe for a better view, more space and a bigger bathroom with a bath. Downside - horrendous pillows, and intermittent wifi. The staff were really helpful over a lost passport and accompanied me to the local Tourist police. The evening buffet is delicious although a little pricey at US$30. The beach gangs weren't a problem and polite no thank you and no eye contact meant I was left alone. Apart from the water aerobics class which involved very loud music that reminded me of my son's DJ practice, it was a very peaceful place to relax for a few days.",positive
"We are being local was a bit skeptical about hotel service towards us locals. Believe me I have many experiences with Local hotels, when it comes to service and treatment for local guess. I traveled with my wife and 8 year old son. I wanted to get away from my busy schedule to a calm and quite beach location in down south. I was searching for good hotel through the web for almost 2 days, and when I was about to give up I came across Heritance Ahungalla. Still, I was not too how it would turn-up. But it was to my surprise that I realize I was so wrong about Heritance Ahungalla. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, we were treated like Kings and Queens to utmost extent possible by their whole staff. Food was fantastic. Especially chefs and the team had done a great job on preparing a broad range of food for all 3 meals. Every time they would have small conversation and check if we comfortable with our food and what else they could prepare. The whole staff at “Jude” restaurant was very friendly and helpful to us and the entire guess at the hotel. We stayed in a deluxe room with direct sea view (No. 321 premium room), was so spacious. Bed was so comfortable, clean and nothing bad to say about the room. I was very pleased to stay in that room. I must truly say it has been a very enjoyable and relaxing experience to all 3 of us. We will for sure visit again and would stay bit longer next time. To all locals, I would definitely recommend this place. A BIG Thank you to Heritance Ahungalla team, for making our short break a wonderful experience!",positive
"This is a First Class hotel and deserves its rating It is excellent in every way but has one huge problem ! The huge problem is the Beach Gangs who patrol the hotel frontage to the beach These gangs are totally illegal but the hotel allows them to harass and harangue the guests These gangs do not accept a polite refusal They are well organised and surround each guest and are extremely agressive They do not give up and basically they hound and bully each poor guest until in desperation a guest agrees to purchase goods from them The goods they sell are unlicensed excursions, unlicensed trips , unlicensed massage parlours and meals in local Hostelries which would be closed down by Health and Safety without even entering inside the premises I think that this is an appalling situation as it is blatantly obvious that Sri Lanka is a poor country and relies heavily on the income from tourists I can assure readers of this column that not one rupee from the pockets of the Beach Gangs will be used to benefit the local community or Sri Lanka as a whole I would also remind readers that in the event of an accident ( which is very common on the crazy Sri Lanka roads ) that Insurance Companies will not pay one penny if a client was travelling on an illegal or unlicensed tour or trip or taxi ride . An unforeseen accident in Sri Lanka can result in enormous medical and hospital and repatriation bills I did complain to the Heritance staff about the continued agressive behaviour of the Beach Gangs ( who also shout to the guests reclining in the hotel grounds ) The staff advised that they all lived locally and thus did not wish to upset the Beach Gangs for fear of repercussions on themselves and on their families In conclusion , I find this an appalling situation whereby the Hotel Management is turning a blind eye to the discomfort and unhappiness of their guests I must also admit quite openly that unless there is some form of financial reward being given weekly to the Hotel Management , I can see no earthly reason why the Hotel Management encourages the Beach Gangs to extort money from their guests Apart from the above problem , I can confirm that this is an excellent hotel I have stayed in most of the decent hotels in Sri Lanka but this is definitely the best in my opinion The rooms ( bedrooms and suites ) are a good size and immaculately furnished; towels , soaps , water etc are changed twice daily and the Housekeeping service is of a very high standard The food is superb and every mealtime offered a new selection of mouth watering delights ; huge prawns and devilled crabs were in such abundance that we eventually declined them as we simply could not eat any more ! There are 2 very large landscaped pools here and both of them were crystal clear and beautifully warm at all times There are also many sports and fitness facilities at this hotel and we really enjoyed our daily game of badminton This hotel sits alone on a massive empty silky sandy beach backed by tall swaying palm trees ; the beach stretches for miles from one headland to the next Swimming in the sea is definitely not possible at this time of the year as the sea is very rough with tremendous undercurrents However , the pools at the Heritance are so large you can easily imagine you are swimming in the sea I should also add that the Ayurveda Spa is a must and is in the most Romantic position imaginable ; their treatments are excellent and their methods of curing aches and pains are really incredible In conclusion , this is an excellent hotel but it will quickly lose its popularity if the Owners do not step in and banish the Beach Gangs",positive
"Now, we have been coming back to this Hotel since it was called Triton because it stood out among typical beach hotels in Sri Lanka and coming here once in a while was treat for our children. It is a quite different now, and not particularly in a good manner. Our last stay at the hotel was on a weekday and was out of season. The property was about half full and a renovation was going on in the main side. At the dining hall, for some odd reason, there were no cloth table napkins and instead, a cheap replacement of paper serviettes. The food served were all so bland and nothing impressive, that's including desserts. I even overheard a couple saying that it was the same for the past few days! Breakfast had in store for us, an averagely spicy Sri Lankan food corner which was quite good. Pools and activity around the pool was enjoyable and the best part of this stay. An interesting underwater Zumba class also took place! The rooms were the same as before, thank goodness, but one thing made me stop my praise. The bidet shower was out of order. There was a surprise at the check out. I made reservation by calling this hotel and made sure that child meal charge was included with the price. (Child stays free in a double room sharing bed but for the meal, they charge about 30USD). In any case, we were asked to pay extra for the child meal because the price mentioned was the Double room rate. It was a mistake done by booking operator and the Hotel said that if we refuse to pay, the balance will have to be deducted from operator's wage. Since we did not want that to happen, we just paid and left. Overall, I think the hotel could have done a little more to repeating guests. I think that the hotel might have gotten complacent, due to the five star rankings people have given them, but as of now we lost loyalty to this hotel and unlikely to recommend others to stay.",negative
"A tranquil & amazing stay at this hotel which is set back from the main road with a STUNNING INFINITY POOL and access to the white sandy Indian Ocean beach (where you can see fishermen working hard for their daily catch). Ahungalla is quiet and there are limited offerings around (although never too far away are roti's and spice gardens). The hotel has all of the amenities that you would expect from a top range hotel, so if you are looking for total RELAXATION, The Heritance delivers in spades! EXCELLENT service and incredibly friendly staff who work together to ensure guests enjoy their stay. On arrival you receive a mouth cleanser (different albeit slightly strange) and a welcome drink (multiple options - very refreshing). There were plenty of options for breakfast and dinner (vegetarians and even just fussy eaters have choices to make). The rooms are large, comfortable and well equiped - the best few nights sleep we had in a 3 week trip!",positive
"We married here 2 years ago and I cant believe I didn't do a review at the time. Just looked at the website and certainly when we married there we found no reason to disagree with what they state on their website. I would definitely recommend marrying here. Would you believe it rained on the day we were due to marry and there was no fuss or bother, they asked us to give them more time so they could move the ceremony from the garden to the beautiful, marble hotel lobby. We took the weeding dinner on the beach only for the heavens to open again! They tried to protect us from the rain but the waiting staff were getting soaked so we moved indoors to a private dining room and carried on with the dinner. They were marvelous and it didnt spoil to occasion at all! It was all professionally handled, the staff were marvelous, food fantastic, location outstanding and we would definitely return here.",positive

"The hotel is just beside the beach and away from the main highway. Thus the sound of the waves makes the stay more enjoyable. The view from the reception of the Indian Ocean over the nice blue swimming pool is simply awesome. I stayed at this hotel during my company's conference and i would remember it my whole life - the view of the beautiful ocean from my room, good food, good service, recreation, live music playing around in the evening and with the sound of the wave , it makes all the tension and tiredness to go away. Would love to visit once again and this time with my wife to spend a very special honeymoon.",positive
A perfect location - right on the beach. The place is very beautifully designed - lovely view of the ocean from the rooms. The infinity pool opens up on the beach. A place where you thoroughly enjoy the ocean. Indian ocean doesn't have high / low tide - same water level all 24 hours. The place was washed away in the 2004 tsunami. They have built a new hotel here. Good food and pleasant staff ready to help you. It's beyond expectation.,positive
"We were at the Hotel in February 2011 for our Honeymoon! We enjoyed our stay at the Hotel thoroughly. I had booked our stay at the Hotel through 'Aitken Spence Travels' Company. They tok good care of us, right from receiving us at Colombo Airport and dropping us off on the last day. The hotel property is beautiful, and their location is splendid. The location of the Hotel is perfect, away from the busy traffic of the city. The quality of food was great and the staff was very helpful through our stay. Our room was over-looking the 2 Tennis courts, but that wasn't a problem. The Hotel spa was also nice. The 2 Swimming pools were awesome! Overall a great way to spend your Holiday and thoroughly relaxing.",positive
"I was at the hotel with my staff and their families occupying 8 rooms last week end. Rooms, pools and the food were at its best. All the staff were very pleasent and always ready to help. Our group was small but the hotel staff was very concern on keeping us occupied and always inquired whether we need any extra activities to be done. We all had a splendid week end and will recommend to others as well.",positive
"Sri Lanka has beautiful hotels but some of the hotels owned by Aitken Spence are by far the best hotels I have stayed in during my stay. There may be better hotels but as far as I know, I enjoyed every one of the hotels. Heritance Ahungalla had a charm and sence of peace, that I found to be quite enchanting. From the moment we walked in, I felt relaxed. The first thing you notice is the beauty that surrounds this hotel, the main pool and the lobby that faces the ocean. At check in, we were offered a drink while the staff got us the rooms. The hotel is large by comparison to other hotels. We got the rooms that were quite a long walk, but the good thing is that the rooms were away from the music in the main lobby, that sometimes was quite loud. One of the rooms we were staying in was quite large, and we had trouble cooling the room due to its size. However, the beds were so comfortable and you feel so relaxed. The hotel has three pools, one in the main lobby area, and the others situated on either side of the wings, mainly for the guests of the hotel. Sometimes it can be crowded during the weekends, due to weekend travelers coming to the hotels, but after Sunday afternoon, the hotel is peaceful and enjoyable. The food at the restaurant was extremly good and we loved the food selections featured. The weekend breakfast and lunch can be a challenge as the capacity of the guests outnumbered the seats available in the restaurant. It is best to come early and get a good table. But the selection of food offered on the weekend is the best. You simply can not finish all the food choices. As far as going to the beach area, it is not that shallow and the waves can be a bit harsh and very choppy. On two occasions, my kids got stung by a small, black jellyfish and had to be treated by the hotel staff. The staff at the hotel took extra care of the kids when they got the jellyfish stings. Even after the event, they wanted to know how the kids were. The staff at the hotel made my stay such a pleasant experience that I would recommend this hotel to anyone. The staff of this hotel were so attentive to everything we needed, and made sure everything went smoothly. One thing I forgot to mention is that this hotel seems to be getting old fast due to the close proximity of the ocean. However, they do their very best in maintaining the hotel to the best of their ability. The dinner time music at the pool area was great to listen to, and it was also a good place to relax and listen to the ocean waves. Hope this review was helpful.",positive
"experienced relaxing weekend with friendly staff and tasty foods at heritance ahungalla ...Scenic beauty of the sea & the cleaned wide beach nowhere else in the south West coast. ,lovely lobby design and ambiance express the uniqueness of the Heritance where inheritance blended with heritage blessings.

"We arrived at the hotel after a long trip from Nuwara Eliya and we were wellcomed with refreshing wet towels and delicios soft driks. The lobby is beautiful and you can't wait to make the check-in to go to the beach. We had a small problem at check in , but it was solved in no time. Our suite was spacious with nice furniture and 3 balconies, where we could enjoy a cup of coffee or tea and listen to the sound of the Indian Ocean's waves. The location is beautiful; you feel like stepping in a postcard with fabulous colors. The beach is amazing and you could sit there forever. We enjoyed the breakfast and lunch at the hotel's reataurants;plenty of food and sweets exposed with taste. The staff is friendlly and helpfull. The hotel is very quiet and private. A perfect place to spend a dream holiday.",positive
Great ambiene enhanced by the genuine warmth of friendly staff. Comfortable rooms. Probably the breakfast spread and variations need to be looked into. Overall a wonderfully relaxing stay at the Heritance Ahungalla.,positive
"We stayed in this hotel as the relax part of our trip to Sri Lanka. We can said that the others heritance hotels we been were better. Because you are in a village, we probably will have all your meals at the hotel, we were disappointed about the quality and the variation of the food during dinner. The hotel is very large and they have to swimming pool areas, the northern one has less people.",neutral
"Have promoted the resort amongst 100s of guests, it was recent that I took the time out to check it my self. The welcome is warm, Front ambience is great, Staff ever so friendly and out to help, Found the higher deluxe rooms greatly comfortable, The deluxe suites much more appealing, Upper walkways needed some attention looked a bit worn off may be because of the sea weather conditions, Great pool, Scrumptious food, Clean beach however mostly warned with red, wish to rate the Heritance Ahungalla an overall gem in the resort list down south in Sri Lanka...(RJ)",positive
"As a traveler the two thingsI look for in a hotel are location and class. The Heritance Ahungalla is the perfect hotel which gives you both. it is in the heart of Ahungalla, a small beach village about 20 minutes away from Bentota. it is a relatively quiet town with not too much to do or see except bask in the Sri Lankan sun. The first thing which caught our fancy was the infinity pool which led right into the beachfront. The lobby was clean and the staff extremely helpful. The beach was very clean and the water a pleasant greenish blue which made you want to just change into your swimsuit and sunbathe all day. The welcome drinks were a mixture of guava and mango juice which were extremely refereshing after our long drive from Nuwaraeliya. We were escorted to sea facing rooms which boasted of a beautiful view of the beach. Our balconies were spacious and had chairs where one could enjoy a hot cuppa tea and watch the sunset. After settling in, we went to the part of the beach which was owned by the hotel and sat for three hours in the tidal pool just lazing around and watching the world go by which is what a holiday is all about. For lunch, we went to a shack situated just five minutes away from the main beach sampling some of the best local fresh seafood in Sri Lanka. The coffee shop in the hotel was also a beach view and had the standard five star breakfast items which is always a good start to the day. the staff were courteous and attentive pouring coffee, water and juice within seconds of request. The gym was a small but nonetheless a good workout. A calm place to spend the last two days of your holiday is what Ahungalla was all about. Initially we contemplated staying in Bentota given the reviews on the Vivanta but I am glad we made the decision to go to Ahungalla instead.",positive
"As soon as you arrive at the hotel you can see through reception across the main pool to the beach and sea. Makes you want to go straight to the pool and beach. The staff set a high standard straight away with a warm greeting, welcome drinks and towels. The rooms are very nicely appointed, we were in a pleasant room facing the sea across a small lawn. The beach is exceptionally quiet, this hotel being the only one within this bay, with wonderfully soft sand. The hotel has two pools. My two young sons loved the main pool, with views across the beach to the sea. We did not get a chance to try the more secluded pool, which looks stunning. Food in the restaurant was delicious, both the Sri Lankan cuisine and the international offerings. Salad and fruit were both wonderfully fresh. The Spa is certainly one of the best in Sri Lanka with expert staff and a relaxing and tranquil setting. We will definitely stay again.",positive
"A Geoffrey Bawa hotel on the coast of Sri Lanka. There are some real highlights: smooth, cool design, excellent swimming pool, fantastic location next to the beach. And some lows: the horrible smoke-filled restaurant (we had to ask for Sri Lankan dishes: they aren't always offered), irritating piped music, dodgy evening karaoke-style entertainer (though, to be fair, some guests seemed to enjoy it), and inadequate wi-fi. I would liked to have given this hotel 3.5 stars, since it is better than ""average"", but that doesn't seem to be available.",neutral
"Excellent resort with a grand size swimming pool just adjacent to the sea coast gives you a feel of taking a dip in the sea itself. Nice rooms with wide balcony mostly with sea facing view. Wide range of platter to choose from. Breakfast spread is huge specially if you are looking at a heavy breakfast to extend your lunch timings. Good gym, childrens entertainment, snooker table etc. Availability of arranging local traditional dance programmes etc. Overall a nice place to relax and send some peaceful time.",positive
That this hotel was designed by Sri Lanka's most respected architect Geoffrey Bawa is plain to see at your very first glance. The opulent pool looks like it is part of the ocean. The food is delicious and the hotel has won many culinary awards. The deluxe room was spacious and clean with a big balcony that has great ocean views. The bathroom was good. There is a second pool further away from the reception which has a jacuzzi. It also has a tree with branches arching over the pool. My sons had great fun climbing the tree and jumping into the pool. A unique experience. We ate at the Jute restaurant and the food was very good. We also ate a delicious lunch at the Mustard coffee shop. We had lovely ice cream sundaes at the pool bar. The staff were very good. A very memorable stay at a fantastic hotel.,positive
"We spent 5 wonderful nights at this beautiful hotel. The staff made us feel like VIP's and their special attention made our stay so memorable. Our room was very comfortable and although we had a few little issues when we first arrived, they were quickly dealt with and were relatively minor. Special thanks to Nipun who provided us with excellent service as well as a tour of the kitchen with a cooking demonstration. It was fantastic and thank you to all the chefs including Sanjaya, Manual, Piyumal, Ruckshan and everyone else who gave us their time and skills in the kitchen. Needless to say the food was fantastic and reasonably priced. The location was perfect for us and after spending 6 hectic days sight seeing, a little piece of serenity was just what we needed. The beach is beautiful and although the surf was a little rough, it was great fun to body surf. The pools were spotless and we loved spending most of our days just lazing on the plentiful lounges near the infinity pool. Although it is a large hotel we were treated like family and it made our stay really wonderful.",positive
"Got a very nice welcome....and the overall stay was nice because of the excellent staff. I had arranged a surprise for my partner and the staff did a wonderful job in executing it and helping me in making it a very romantic evening. My only disappointment was the food and I came across a big insect on the corridors on two occasions....not that the hotel can be blamed for it because its an open hotel with trees in the corridors. We had a nice room with beach view and a big balcony.....but the other side of the hotel (near the gym) had very eerie and hospital like corridors. So it may be a good idea to let them know you want a room away from the gym. The spa is good but overpriced. Overall nice if you want to escape for a weekend...anything more than 2 days and you will find the place boring. For good food in bentota....I suggest Aman villa located near the old dutch fort,Galle.....Must try the crab curry!",positive
"This hotel was a bit of a disappointment, not the five star rating we were expecting. In our opinion this hotel needs to be downgraded to four star. Whilst there was some painting/maintenance work taking place while we were there, the hotel didn’t have that ‘luxurious’ five star feeling about it. Certainly comparing it to a five star rated hotel we stayed in whilst holidaying in Zanzibar 18 month's ago, it was definitely of a different class/standard. The fruit bowl, dressing gowns and slippers were not in our room when we arrived and there was no mention, when we checked in, of them arriving later. The cream rug was filthy (we rolled it up and put it under the bed) and that improved the look of the room immediately! On the plus side, the staff were extremely friendly and helpful and very responsive to our needs. On several occasions we only had one bath towel left instead of two which meant having to call house-keeping. Although immediately we called the second towel would rapidly appear, this isn't the level of service we would expect from a five star resort. The restaurant areas were nice and the food was good. We tended to eat in the coffee shop which also served as a restaurant which did some nice meals, we did eat occasionally in the buffet restaurant. The pool area is nice. The hotel is located on the beach, but most of the time the red flags are flying due to the under currents there. On most days despite the red flag flying people still went into the sea, if you went with caution you were fine, but there were occasions people got into difficulties and the life guard at the hotel had to come to their rescue. We enjoyed watching a wedding take place whilst there. We also had the experience of seeing one of the resident monitor lizards digging up and eating another monitor lizard’s eggs (13 in all!!!). We were lucky enough to see a turtle come ashore and lay her eggs on the beach before going back out to sea – wow what a wonderful experience. We also visited a turtle hatchery up the road, take a tuk tuk (it’s cheaper than a taxi) and if you want to experience putting baby turtles into the sea you need to go at dusk around 6.00 pm (in Feb). Before booking this hotel we were told we could go out of the hotel and that there were lots of eating places in the area, this is not the case. We were told not to go out of the resort at night, so that was also disappointing. Sadly there is no ‘all inclusive’ option here. In summary, this is a nice hotel, situated on a lovely beach, not five star luxury, but a nice four star. We were here celebrating my 50th birthday and wanted a bit of luxury after touring for 8 nights and in retrospect wish we had stayed at either The Jetwing Lighthouse or The Fortress in Galle.",neutral
Beautful room with a balcony overlooking the beach. Great pool and poolside bar. The staff were very friendly and helpful but it is a much larger hotel than any others we stayed in on our Sri lanka trip and a little lacking in atmosphere.,positive
The hotel decor is a little stark and requires a makeover - with the corridors resembling a hospital ward - a few pictures would liven the place up a bit. That said we ate at the Bar Restaurant and the food was very good. the hotel pools were enjoyable - but the seclusion was spoiled as the beach was intersected from the hotel grounds by a number of hawkers - who were polite enough but incessant. The beach was lovely - and we even witnessed a giant turtle arriving on shore in teh afternoon to lay its eggs - amazing. All said - I expected more - and beware teh burning sun!,neutral
"At a loss to understand how some guests have only given this hotel just 1 or 2 stars. Have just spent a month there and thoroughly enjoyed the stay. The best part was undoubtedly the friendliness of all the staff. Our only negative was the fact that the hotel was NOT all inclusive. A special mention to Dinusha Kularathne, who relly looked after us. Many thanks. It was not a cheap holiday, and four weeks was probably a week too long, but we have no hesitation in recommending the Heritance Ahungalla.",positive
"A large hotel in good location but after some of the other places we stayed in Sr lanka it was rather soulless and way more expensive. Having said that it has all the usual facilities , the room was fine and the buffets at dinner were excellent. The swimming pool and sun bathing facilities were good and the staff looked after us fine. You should visit the turtle breeding/refuge nearby.",neutral
"We stayed at this hotel for just one night on B&B basis. The room had a private balcony overlooking the pool and the sea. We ordered room service for both lunch and dinner. The food was good, delivery was quick and service was friendly and efficient. The breakfast buffet had a good spread with both international and Sri Lankan cuisine. The only complaint we had was that the A/C vent in the room was old and/or faulty as it made a rattling noise throughout the entire stay. We called maintenance and they came to take a look at it, but it couldn’t be rectified allegedly the hotel was full, so we didn’t have the option of moving to another room. Because of this, we didn’t sleep very well and our short stay was not as relaxing as we hoped.",neutral
Heritance Ahungalla maintains the high standards it is reputed for. The rooms are clean and very comfortable. Vast range of food at mealtime! I was particularly impressed with the friendliness and warmth of the reception staff. The entertainment at night was outstanding. The foreign guests were genuinely thrilled! Plenty of activity in the hotel. Animator Raju who handled the Water Aerobics segment was truly outstanding!!! My only complaint is that the hotel was fully booked....and therefore somewhat over crowded!!!!! My wife Farina and I had a relaxing week-end.,positive
"My wife Lynda and I have just returned from a 9 day stay at the Heritance as part of a cricket watching tour of Sri Lanka. We were in a ground floor room that was very nice, great shower and a door which opened onto a small patio facing the gardens, it was also kept spotlessly clean. Both pools are really nice with plenty of sunbeds, towels and mattresses provided by the eager pool staff. The beach is right there at your doorstep but the ocean is quite rough and not really suitable for younger children. the food is excellent throughout the hotel but the rice and curry in the cafe is to die for, with most Sri Lankan food it is very spicey but just ask and they will tone it down if required. Best of all were the staff, always with a smile and very attentive and helpful, a special mention must go to my friend Nimesh Shamalka Fernando with who we had great fun throughout our stay. The only small negative is the hotel location, It's a long way from the airport and not much within walking distance along the beach or outside the gates. Forget the taxis and use the local air conditioned smaller local bus to get to Galle, takes approx 1 hr and costs 50/75pence, use the Tuk-Tuk's for shorter journeys, a real eye opening experience!!! but a ""must do"" :-)",positive
"We just got back from 9 nights at the Heritance in April (broken with a short tour to a national park). The hotel has lovely pools, the rooms were comfy and well air conditioned and the food was excellent too. It is not as cheap as some sri lankan fare, but for the most part it is good quality. We were B&B so buying other meals/drinks and this averaged at around £12 per person per day for lunch and dinner plus drinks throughout the day. We were there during the recent tsunami warning after the 8.7 earthquake in indonesia struck. The staff we calm helpful and reassuring- despite the fact that many of them must have been worried for families and friends in the area. We were evacuated to the top floor and given free food and drink throughout the 3 hour alert. I couldn't fault them. One down side is that it is a bit isolated- but its not far to bentota which is full of bustle and energy.",positive
"we arrived to find the england and sri lankan cricket team staying here.brilliant staff good food,nothing is to much trouble,we had a great stay 14 nights in total.not much entertaintment but nice and relaxing.two nice pools plenty of beds,great service by pool attendants.thanks for a great stay.",positive
"Beautiful hotel, could not fault it. Great food and although a big hotel the service was personal.",positive
Had a great stay - ideal for a relaxing holiday by the beach - agree as regards pools with prior comment - breakfasts also excellent. Pool aerobics fun for all.,positive
As you enter the hotel. You feel like you entering a mansion in South America with the ponds and coconut trees at the entrance porch which stretches about 500m.When you step into the hotel you will see a beautiful swimming pool which is almost same level as the see. The pools are the wonders of the hotel. The rooms are spacious and has nice interior design. Toilets are scary because of their design using cements makes it looks dirty. Otherwise the restaurant and buffet are excellent.,positive
Beautifully designed pool...Love the food...amazing.. You have alot of peace & tranquilty; especially,positive
"A country full of lovely friendly people with happy smiling faces. Their delightfully naive view of life being that if they give something a 5* rating then it must be so. The problem is that prices have gone up to international 5* levels giving rise to the expectation that it will compare to other high graded hotels around the world. This maybe one of a group of Sri Lankan higher quality hotels but no way is it as 5* by INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS. At best it is a low 4*/high 3*. The entrance is spectacular and beautiful but the rest of the property is simply awful. Poor maintenance, unsafe tiles around the pools, under equipped rooms with intermittent electrical supplies and poor drainage. Hawkers on the beach screaming for your attention every time you go anywhere near them. Nobody walking around with any frequency to see if would like a drink whilst sunbathing etc. It could be so good if only they understood what makes a 5* hotel. Still delightful and enjoyable providing you don't go expecting the best, but it is poor value for money.",negative
"We were there to spend the day in January. It is a nice and clean hotel, friendly staff and good food.",positive
"We arrived at this hotel on the 13th February with friends we stayed for 3 weeks and they stayed for 4 weeks. It is a beautiful hotel, with the most fantastic reception view of the infinety pool. The reception staff were the most pleasant and helpful we have ever come across. We had a top floor (only 3 storey) at the end of the wide hotel with the most beautiful view from our spacious balcony. I have to say there is nothing much to do outside of the hotel but that was never a problem as there were lovely comfy bars to sit in on an evening. After having read some of the reviews about the food I honestly don't know what some people want because there was plenty of selection for everyone's taste and the quality was excellent. It is very hot and humid so the towels are changed twiced a day (never had that before) and the bedding fresh every day and they never missed. The beach is gorgeous however it is annoying when every time you go out the beach sellars pounce on you but if you are direct and say no then they leave you alone. There are 2 lovely pools one is the infinity pool and the other is a nice large pool at the other side both are very clean. It gets full marks for not having to fight for a sunbed as there are always plenty around and we got the same one's every time we sunbathed (arn't we boring!!) plus the boys always got the towels ready for you. You have to remember this is Sri Lanka 5 star and we would all stay there again in a heartbeat.",positive
"At one stage furing the tour planning, we planned to stay two nights at Heritance, Ahangulla. We thank our forefathers that we decided otherwise. It would have been an expensive disaster had we stayed there any longer than the 12 hours that we spent there. I can not fathom who ever gave this hotel a five star rating. It must be with the help of some under hand dealings. The mistake I did was that the tour was booked through the agency who owned this hotel. There is an obvious conflict of interest here. This is at best a three star hotel.....nothing more. Minuses: unclean floors, dirty pool, dirtier pool towels, fountain with black water in the front of the hotel and by the side of the main dining area, walls, roof all badly needing a stroke of paint, cracked walls, beaches infested with intrusive locals, stray dogs.... Plus: couldn't think of any!",negative
"Nicely designed hotel with a very relaxing atmosphere. Has 2 nice pools, out of which one is only for residence. I got a ground floor room which is open towards the residence pool area. The pool looks really nice with some trees falling over towards the pool from one side. Always ask for a room facing the residence pool area. I stayed in a basic room and it was spacious, clean & comfortable. Overall the hotel & the rooms look a bit old (with slightly broken walls & tiles) since the last time I visited, but the good thing is it was clean & nothing to complain. Staff was very friendly & pleasant and were always willing to serve. I had breakfast & lunch which I ordered from the a la cartemenu. It was tasty but a bit expensive compare to most Sri Lankan hotels. Only disappointment was the buffet, which was too expensive. They used to have a very good spread few years back.",positive
"This hotel was a great disappointment for us. This was our sixth night in Srilanka and when we made the bookings we were so excited about this hotel and the photos we have seen. However, our stay there was a disaster! We waited for more than 30 mins to Check in. When we checked it, the room was in a mess and the telephone lines were not working. We complained to the reception and all they said that this was because of the rain and it will come back within 10 mins but it didn't. We tried again but it was useless. The receptionist and the staff were rude and their service was far below the standards. to make things worse, there was a school trip that night and the kids occupied the swimming pool, the restaurant and everywhere in the hotel. The restaurant was expensive and the food was average but the service was a little bit better than anywhere else in the hotel. The room was small but the balcony was nice. In general I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. If you still want to go there, then please ensure that you are in the middle of the week and not on Saturday/Sunday or Friday to avoid the busy times at the hotel where the service drops down to the lowest level.",negative
"Perfect location on the beach, beautiful design, staff very kind, clean and well maintained room, really good meal in hotel restaurant.",positive
"On first appearances this hotel wow's you. This is not 5 star by any stretch of imagination. Over priced and quite tacky. Maybe the best in Ahungalla, not in Sri Lanka. There sister concern ""The Tea Factory Hotel"" beats them by a canter on all counts. The long corridors leading to the rooms were run down. The room was large with a sit out. The housekeeping was slack. The food was quite mediocre. The buffet is a total rip off. It is very highly priced and the food was very average. The beach boys on the beach are a menace and quite intimidating. It put you off from wanting to step out on the beach. Would I return? No.",negative
"Reception staff were quite rude and took 2 hours to check us in. We were part of a large party and bookings were made some 6 months in advance of our arrival. One family of 4 were made wait in reception for over 3 hours before their room was available. Having said that the service staff, room attendants, waiters and bar staff were extremely accommodating and nothing was too much trouble. Rooms were not up to 5 star cleanliness and linen was worse than 1 star standard. Mini Bar was only refilled on request. The only thing 5 star about the hotel is the price and possibly the location, but be prepared to be pestered by hawkers as soon as you set foot on the beach.",negative
"Right on the beach, 2 beautiful pools, and really lovely staff - who are definitely the major asset. But WHY do the bathrooms look so unclean? our shower screen was limescaled (heavily), the floors and walls needed upgrading as they were scuffed and marked and impossible to clean (polished concrete walls au naturel! - but evidently the architect who designed them loves the effect so it doesn't matter!). On the plus side the bed was wonderfully comfortable. Breakfast was in a low ceilinged dark room (often smokey from the cooking of bacon or hoppers) - where you help yourselves but have to wait for tea/coffee (i.e. flag down a waiter if you can catch their eye - although there are always plenty of them around) - and geared to Big Appetites and touring parties. The dinner buffet food in the same room was lukewarm and no one attends it to ensure it is stirred/kept hot. The menus are very restricted. Where are all the delicious tastes of Sri Lanka? Why travel all this distance to eat (mediocre) European food! The middle range restaurant (I think it was called Mustard) with a terrace overlooking the pool was the best, as the food was cooked to order, and the staff more than willing to experiment with something off the menu if they had the ingredients. The beauty salon was staffed by wonderful Balinese girls who gave a very good deep tissue massage - but the standard of the treatment rooms (just converted bedrooms) was poor. Expect more ambience for the price. Not 5* by European/International standards and more expensive for food/drink than the Amangalla or the Galle Face. The hotel facilities need upgrading to earn their stars!",neutral
"The sign next to reception says the hotel was voted the best 5 star hotel in Sri Lanka in 2010. If it's true then I just wonder what the rest must be like ! The original standard room was appalling and after complaining we were upgraded to a deluxe room which was good. All public areas are in need of refurbishment and there is a lack of any serious evening entertainment. Alcoholic drinks are some of the most expensive I have come across, either in Europe, Asia or the USA. The dinner experience in the Jute restaurant is mediocre, unless you like curry. It's a buffet and nothing is really hot. There appears to be a problem with the extractor fans and as the breakfast is cooked in the restaurant there is always a cloud of smoke circulating in the mornings.The room has a low ceiling and the decor is dark. The are two nice pools but the tiling around the edges is very uneven and loose. The beach is long and pleasant but the irritating, aggressive beach hawkers who stand ten metres away shouting to attract the attention of the guests make life unpleasant, they are a major problem. The beach has a lot of debris strewn about , bottles, polystyrene etc, but the management claim it is the job of the local council to clear it. As a previous poster has said, there is nothing close to the hotel and very little to do. For $150 per night it would be reasonable, but for the $300 per night ( b&b) we paid it is way overpriced. As Sri Lanka seems to have their own star rating system, I would rate this hotel on an international basis as no more than 3.5 stars. The staff go out of their way to be helpful",neutral
"If you are into stuffing your face on buffets and booze, probably a great hotel for you. If you are looking for quality food and culture, or even 5 star service probably not for you. Outwardly the hotel looks great, they rely on the great infinity pool for the wow factor but scratch the surface and there is not much else a pontins holiday park wouldn't provide. Probably why there are limited photo's on the website apart from the pool. We paid extra for a luxury room, which was very nice but cost enough to justify. The room along with the friendly staff were the best parts of the holiday. Breakfast was average, dark, dingy, smokey (cooking smoke) buffet room. Nice cooked options, and hoppers. Waffles were very nice, but coffee served was just terrible. Green pool was OK, but cloudy water. Good green pool service Nice beach, but not worth visiting due to the constant hassle. People have to earn a living but it gets a bit draining to be friendly, only to be hassled to buy something every time you want to walk along the beach. Grotty and hot gym, with old equipment. Miles away from anywhere, so unless you want a 1/2hr tuk tuk ride to Bentota (which is fine and plenty of offers outside the gate) you are stuck with hotel options. The best food we found was in the mustard cafe, lovely curries. Everything else was overpriced euro buffet. Final nail in the coffin was check-out, no service at the nice reception desk, you go round to the back office, smelly little room where you que up to pay your $$$$ bill while the cashier argues and discusses other bills with clients and colleagues. Then the taxi you ordered with the concierge isn't booked after all, they just look at each other and call over the 20 year old smelly wagon. We refused to get in, and they got an equally smelly but slightly newer car for the 9000 rupee ride to Colombo. Smelly is a reoccurring issue here. Overall, 5 star luxury room (for the right $$$) in a 3 star resort......With a really good looking pool.",negative
"We had visited this place along with our local freinds in Sri Lanka.. The most beautiful and human culture the Srilankans have is a BEAUTIFUL SMILE. The hotel staff very polite and on their toes to help in case required. But the most amazing thing is their breakfast , lunch and the dinner...ofcourse the INFINITY POOL. my daughte just would not want to be out of that place. All we did was lazed in the poola dn ate to our hearts content.. AMAZING SRILANKA",positive
"The layout of this hotel is sublime! Designed by the famous architect Geoffrey Bawa, it a series of pavilions joined together that feel more like a private residence than a luxury hotel. We stayed for 5 days over the local New Year celebrations last April & would go back in a heartbeat! Located right on the beach, with a couple of pools, our room opened out onto the grounds in front of the more private inner pool. It felt like a secret hideaway, with a massive low lying tree overhanging the pool that the kids had endless hours of fun with swinging off the branches. We were upgraded to a junior suite at the resort manager's discretion as the tour operator had stuffed up our booking. The room was Huge, so that when they brought in the 2 roll away beds for the children, there was still ample room to move around, sit, play, dress. On the ground floor, the balcony doors opened right onto the grass that led to the pool 10 meters away. It was quiet, helped by the pounding of the ocean waves 100 meters away..that was the only noise you heard! Totally comfortable, totally ideallic. The room did smell a bit musty when we got in but a few drops of cinnamon oil from housekeeping fixed that immediately ( we still associate cinnamon oil with Sri Lanka!). We stayed at a particularly festive period & there was much fussing & preparations with special meals, sweets & decorations for the Sri Lankan new year - simply the best time to visit! The food buffet every evening was superb with many choices of all foods but also a variety of curries, the breakfasts got a bit hectic as the new year day approached with the hotel at capacity from many local families holidaying, they had to open the ballroom to seat everyone, but that just added to the festive feel. Games & carnival excitement marked the day itself, a few rains & some brilliant thunderstorms over the week meant we had a very Tropical adventure! The beach is rough as the waves just pound onto the shore, the walk along the beach is peppered with animals, plants & all sorts of things that kids like to pass the time with...the best being the monkeys on the trees throwing coconuts when we arrived! Loads of things to do outside the resort like visit the turtle sanctuary, the lagoons, the fisherman on stilts, the shrine dedicated to the tsunami victims. It is a poor country, ravaged by civil war & mother nature but the people are one of a kind, ,totally happy & welcoming.This is a classic luxury beach hotel.",positive
"Would totally recommend this hotel. Stayed for 2 weeks on an all inc. basis. The hotel is situated right on the beach surrounded by tropical gardens. Enjoyed a room, no 256, on the second floor overloooking one of 2 swimming pools with a sea view. The room was kept spotlessly clean by the very friendly, attentive housekeeping staff who also visited in the evening to ensure we had everything we needed. All the staff at the hotel were courteous, smiley and extemely friendly. They werel helpful and eager to meet all queries and requests. We could not have been looked after better. The food is amazing with a wide variety to suit all tastes and the deserts were spectacular. Watch out for the beach traders who can pester you on the beach and 'enjoy' the persistance of the locals selling sarongs etc who stand on the edge of the hotel grounds trying to entice you over to buy their wares. The sea looks very enticing but is not safe for swimming due to the strong undertow which was a disappointment but obviously not the hotel's fault. The swimming pools more than make up for this. Another positive of this hotel is that the sunbeds are plentiful and well situated. Towels are provided. Would recommend the Arrak cocktails!",positive
"Got a great room overlooking the main pool area with a sea view. Very luxurious with a large balcony area. Had two great pools, each with a pool bar. Good sports facilities - pool, tennis, table tennis, etc. Food was fantastic - great spread and very delicious. But what struck my wife and I most was the staff - so courteous and helpful. They were always close at hand and ever ready to assist. Very very pleasant. The rates are not cheap but it is absolutely value for money. Will def look forward to visiting more hotels in the Heritance group soon!",positive
"This hotel has a fantastic, idyllic location on the beach with great views, sand, sea and a beautiful swimming pool. Rooms are all wooden with large beds and showers and most balconies overlook the sea in some way. Lots of staff are available to service your every need and are very willing to help. Buffet food was very good with plenty of choice and different themed nights. You can also eat outside which is far nicer but you have to ask as it isn't readily offered. The only down sides were that the staff were a little too friendly - there was a constant expectation that you tip - to take bags to the room, for sun beds, for someone to bring you an iron. The hotel adds tax on top of the menu prices as well as 10% service charge on everything. This means everything is 25% more expensive than it appears. There was a lot of conferences going on which had special attention and sometimes entertainment on but as guests there was nothing to tell you what that evening entertainment was. We went direct to the locals for tuk tuk rides and local trips as you are able to haggle prices and make sure the money goes directly into the local community rather than to the large hotel chain. Prices are cheaper this way too and we had no problems with the integrity of the locals at any point although they are inclined to pounce on you every time you go on the beach. I would recommend staying here but be prepared that it costs a huge amount more than you bargain for especially if you drink alcohol- a bottle of wine is anywhere upwards from £40!! Oh but don't fly with Sri Lankan Airlines they were terrible.",positive
"Just stayed here for two weeks including getting married on 8th Feb. Bit of a journey from the airport but well worth it!!! Room was superb, clean, spacious, great balcony. The staff were amazing, always checking you are ok, having a chat, asking if you ned anything, they cannot do enough to help. The food is excellent both in the main restaurant and the coffee shop and the two pools are fantastic too, both infinity pools and clean and well looked after. Our wedding was just the perfect day and was handled superbly by all the staff, there is nothing we could fault at all, they made it so special for us culminating in a superb meal on the beach. I can't speak highly enough of everyone at the hotel and would thoroughly recommend it for a holiday and wedding. Would love to go back at some point in the future. Sri Lanka is a beautiful country and holiday and wedding was made perfect by everyone at this hotel.",positive
"Very nice hotel, Situated perfectly on the beach of the Indian Ocean. Great room, good restaurants and bar. Beautiful design, magnificent swiming pools. What a pity, we have had only one night there.",positive
"We stayed two nights here ,were greeted with the usual welcome drink in a beautiful lobby ,the rooms on the other hand are very dated,had to walk quite a bit to get to them,reasonably clean but definitely not 5 star standard,the pools are lovely with the main pool having quite a bit of action.the beach is clean ,but young girls and pretty women beware of the beach boys.The buffet was average and the desserts really not very good.But still an overall relaxing time,especially if in good company.",positive
when we checked with great expectations about the 5 star facility we were greeted with cob web with spiders running in the room. the ceiling fan was so dirty i think they have not cleaned the room for 3 or 4 months. we have to call the reception and lodge a compliant to clean the room so as to enable us to sleep.,negative
"This was our last stay of our travel around Sri Lanka. We were looking for somewhere to unwind and relax at the end of the trip and this is exactly what we did. The hotel is right on the Beach with a stunning reception / entry. When you step inside there is a pool which goes straight to the beach. Checkin was easy with the ususal welcome drinks. Our room was also fantastic which overlooked the beach, it was also clean and tidy and seviced to 5 star standards. The beach was also nice and warm, there is also another pool in the resort. Be prepared though when you go to the beach for the ladies selling saris and wraps, if you are not used to it it can be a shock, we just said no and kept walking. Gym was also great and had excellent equipment. The food and staff were excellent, the best of our whole stay in Sri Lanka. We were sick of Buffets but the ones here were just amazing. We also ate in the alacrate restaurant and that was some of the best we have had globally. We met the chefs and we talked to them as to what were were after for a special dinner and when it came our it was delicious. Lobstters / Seafood were caught daily and fresh. My wife and I also asked whether we could get a Sri Lankan cooking class and the Chefs kindly obliged and gave us a private demosntration in their kitchen. All staff from cleaners the hotel's executive team were extremely polite, helpful and would bend over backwards for you. The hotel also provides unlimited, free internet. In summary was one of the best hotels we have staye at, we cannot recommend it highly enough. We are already planning our trip back. This is the best in a great selection of hotels that the Aitken Spence chain has. At the end of the beach about 5 minutes walk there is also a great restaurant called sunshine run by locals, food is cheap and freash and tasty. Worth a visit.",positive
I must comment on the food as it was wonderful. The lunch and dinner buffet was excellent. The hotels atmosphere is very relaxing. I was a little dissappointed with the rooms as I expected more quality from a five star hotel. The staff were very friendly and helpful.,positive
"Well designed hotel with two large pools right next to a lovely palm fringed beach. Food in the buffet was of a very high quality and the menu changed each day. Service was slightly patchy though staff were friendly and eager to please. Plenty of activities with volleyball, tennis, badminton and a gym on offer. We had few treatments at the spa which were very good and reasonably priced. There were a lot of families staying at the hotel which meant our children always had other kids to play with. Overall a v good beach hotel and we hope to go back someday.",positive
"This was my 5th visit to the Heritance in 5 years, and some of its spark has gone. The personalities on the Food and Beverage side used to be brighter, but as there is ample competition in Sri Lanka may have lured some of the better staff away. Check in is still and always has been problematic, especially the inability to get people through the process quickly or keep them occupied when the hotel is fully booked and rooms arent yet ready. Having said that, they did manage to accommodate the special request for my room, and ever facet of my stay was more than pleasant. The expedia rate was twice as expensive as the walk in rate which was odd. I expected expedia and others to have better rates, but when we extended for a night, we got a wonderful rate.",positive
"I took my family (wife and 2 boys - 11yrs and 8yrs) to spend 5 days upto Christmas day. The hotel is beautifully designed, blending well with the environment and having a colonial feel. The rooms are tastefully furnished with good quality furnishings and are well air conditioned. The room was kept clean by house keeping twice a day so inspite of my boys best efforts it didn't stay messy for long. The hotel isn't fully air conditioned, common areas are open to the environment which suits my tastes - I didn't go to the tropics to feel like I am in Nothern Europe but air conditioning is nice in the restaurant and in the bed rooms to help get some sleep. The hotel has two pools, an infinity pool at the centre of the hotel and a more secluded ""green"" pool. Both pools are spacious and clean. Both my boys enjoy swimming so it was impossible to keep them out of the pools. The sea next to hotel was nice to swim in and the beach was clean. The hotel has tennis courts, a badmington court, and a table tennis table that also helped to keep the boys occupied. It also has a gym that looks well equipped but if I am honest I didn't make use of it though I should have because the food was fanastic and plentiful. The hotels culinery team had just won first place in a competition among all the hotels in Sri Lanka, beating the Colombo Hilton team so you can understand it was of a very high standard. We found the staff from the maintenance workers to the the restaurant staff and right up to the hotel's general manager extremely polite and helpful. The reception staff were very helpful throughout and arranged a whale watching excursion for us. All the staff worked tirelessly to prepare for a Christmas eve party and though they were very busy they took time to find out whether there was anything else they can do. The hotel also provides unlimited, free wifi throughout the hotel by means of a key code you get from reception, really useful to keep in touch with family back home. All-in-all we had a wonderful time at this hotel and I cannot recommend it highly enough. We will definitely be visiting it again.",positive
"We checked in on New Year's eve to see 2012 in. We'd booked a triple room and paid a 50% advance at the head office at Aitken Sence Colombo, which was mandatory due to the New Year's eve rush. But the room was not ready at check- in and we had to wait quite awhile. We were given large half glasses (yeah half!) of a local fresh juice but realised later that other check in guests were given moist towels as well. Finally, we were taken into a 2 roomed suite that had been furnished for only two persons. We had to look for a room boy to tip him to bring in a third bed, third set of towels etc.etc. Our so-called luxury room was far from that - the 'fridge didn't work, the TV was badly tuned, the safety deposit locker malfunctioned, one bedside light didn't work.. Due to the malfunctioning fridge we were not even able to break a bottle of bubbly.. (now who likes warm champagne) - (BTW check the spelling of 'champagne' in the GM's letter of welcome - here my sex was wrong - I was titled as 'Mr' We had tipped the check-in steward - a name like Achila - do avoid this scoundrel at all costs! - generously to get us a table for the gala dinner, but he was nowhere to be seen. We looked into the area four times, to ensure that we had a table, but nothing had been set up for us. Finally, we were told to come down for dinner and that we would then get our table. No table when we arrived for dinner. We were then told to sit at another table. Five minutes later the same steward - named Mudalige - said he was sorry but the table had been booked by somebody else!!- I refused to get up! Our table had no lamp of decor etc like the other tables and after telling just about every waiter passing by, we got some of these things over 1 1/2 hours later!! The next day at breakfast, after standing in line for awhile, I requested a warm item from a serving chef, I was told by him that he had to serve over 50 guests at that time (so what?!). Finally, the time to depart arrived, and we breathed a sign of relief. We were all women but even the final receipt was titled 'Me & Mrs"". When I got to my car in the hotel car park I found parts of it strewn about - it had been damaged by a tour operator who had claimed that I had been blocking him! Now this was a clearly designated hotel parking space which should have been so designed not to inconvenienced other vehicles. The hotel couldn't even inform the person to remove my vehicle (they didn't even know the name or company of the vandal) because it keeps no records of guest vehicles - rather a security threat in a country just recovering from civil strife, methinks.... Having said this, the general manager and front office manager were extremely nice and tried to compensate for our traumatic experience by even offering us an extra night on the house, but we had to get back to our families on new years day - so we were given a discount on the room rate, cakes and chocolates to forget our troubles.. The room rate for this unforgettable experience was well over $ 400 and unforgettable experience it certainly was! It will be a loooong time before we recover from the trauma of our stay at Heritance Ahungalla. This is a hotel that needs to get its act together in terms of processes, quality checks and staff training. This is what we pay for when we buy a hotel experience. It is also what we pay for when the hotel is incompetent.",negative
"The hotel has a very high standard of service. Check in was handled very professionally and courteously. We stayed in a Premium room which had an excellent sea frontage. Service levels from check in to check out were fantastic. I have to say that the Aitken Spence hotels service begins with the reservation process. They have the best and most customer friendly online booking service of all the hotel groups. You felt welcome as you arrived. The fine dining restaurant food, ambience and service was excellent and we enjoyed our dinner there. The breakfast buffet was also varied and the food tasty. I would highly recommend this hotel",positive
We loved our time at the Heritance. The staff are amazing and really looked after us. Our driver Pema organised great trips and knew special places to take us. The hotel is in good condition the food was good but it could have had a wider a la carte menu. The only problem was a lack of things to do in the evening but that's typical of beach resorts. Definitely worth staying.,positive
"Having spent many holidays along the beautiful west coast of Sri Lanka, trying out the various hotels over the years, I can honestly say that Heritance Ahungalla is my favourite. Convenient to get to from Colombo on the new Expressway, it is situated about 90 kilometers from Colombo. From the moment I drive up to the entrance with the fantastic view right up to the sea, I feel at home. There is such a feeling of peace and serenity with the warm yet gentle welcome from the staff. I have requested sea view rooms and have never been disappointed. Room 305 is my favourite. If you like tasty food and lots of it, Heritance Ahungalla is the place to be. I think their chefs are about the best in Sri Lanka. The buffet has a huge selection of dishes to please the western and local palate. The salads varied and desserts yummy. Heritance has two attractive large swimming pools, and also a very attractive beach. The seas around Sri Lanka can be dangerous around monsoon time, but if you love messing around in the shallow water, going for long walks or just sun bathing it is wonderful. I strongly recommend Heritance Ahungalla, if you want a relaxing holiday. I always come away feeling rested and energized wishing I could stay longer! Elizabeth Gunewardene",positive
"A hotel with really delicious food, couldn't resist. Very nice and helpful staff. Pool attendance take care of every lonely bed not to be reserves with a towel too long. Very nice furnished rooms with a lot wood and wooden floor and nice furniture. A lot of place for sunbeds. A really great architecture of the hotel designed by the famous architecture. Wonderful atmosphere for couples in the reastaurant during evening. Do not bother when locals thry to sell you cloths on the beach, they are freindly though noisy, they are not allowed in the hotel garden, so will try to seduce you from a distance. But this is their way of eraning money for living...",positive
Beautiful property with great pools and an excellent view. Staff was extremely friendly and accommodative. We travelled with our two kids (2 yrs and 1 yr) and had a chance to even meet Mr. Jayasuriya (Sri Lanka cricket team). Place looks even more beautiful when it rains :). We stayed for 4 nights and I must say it was all worth it,positive
"I went here just before Christmas, with friends. It's a lovely hotel - good rooms, nice food, good location (although sea swimming a bit rough). Gym, swimming pool, jacuzzi, free wi-fi, all the trappings. But the service just didn't match up - it was very pleasant. all the staff were extemely nice. But poor English, sloppy service, long waits when ordering anything. So although I'd recommend it, I do hope that Heritance take some time and trouble to train the staff properly - it's a great hotel, but the service lets it down. Biggest black mark was the very vocal hawkers on the beach - they stay just on the hotel boundary, and shout and harass the guests trying to sell things. Not pleasant at all, and really ruins what would otherwise be a restful and relaxing place. I'm surprised the hotel hasn't negotiated with them to tone down their somewhat agressive selling techniques.",neutral
"Spent boxing day at Heritance Ahungalla. Architecture of the hotel is beautiful. There is a gorgeous infinity pool facing the ocean. Staff was friendly and check in was quick. Rooms and bathroom were spacious and could see that they had been renovated recently. Free wifi is also available in rooms for guests. The most impressive thing about the hotel is definitely the food. The range, the presentation and the taste of the buffet was truly excellent. I would go back for the food. For breakfast, lunch and dinner there were a number of action and carvery stations and plenty of choice for even the pickiest eaters. It is noteworthy that the Sri Lankan food is very good and worth trying. Highly recommend trying hoppers for breakfast and Sri Lankan rice and curry for lunch. Even though the hotel was full the staff was attentive and the service was quick in the restaurants. Summing up I would say Heritance Ahungalla lives up to the standards of the Heritance chain. It is a wonderful place to relax, enjoy the sea, sun and sand and indulge in good food.",positive
"On arrival we had to wait for 30 minutes to check in to our suite, The manager apologised and upgraded to the luxury Sir Cliff Richard suite, we were here for 4 nights and it was an amazing experience. Great architecture, amazing food and great service. Kids loved it.",positive

"Stayed in this hotel with wife and kid. This hotel has great architecture and nice pool. Food was excellent and can go again for food. However room was very small and compact for a class of this hotel and other hotels have larger rooms and better bathrooms. Service could have been better. Empty plates from others rooms were left outside the room and it was not very pleasant. Was planning to stay an extra day, however did not because of the room. Expected more from the Heritance chain, especially compared to Kandalama",neutral
"A very nice, fancy resort with all you need. Staff was great, room large and modern, breakfest and buffet dinner awsome, pools fantastic. THe beach is great, though it's not privet so vendors are there all thr time. no bath tub in my room but the shoer was huge and great.Wi fi is free for a week even though it's says otherwise when you first log in - the pasword will be given free at the reception.",positive
"The best thing about the resort is its brilliant architecture. It is very open, spacious and airy. If you see the pool from the lobby, it looks as if it has merged with the sea. Every room has a beautiful view of the pool and the beach. Food is a problem if you are a vegetarian. The staffs are courteous and had arranged a sightseeing trip to the turtle hatchery and mangrove boating for us. If you are travelling to Srilanka, a 2 days stay at Heritance Ahungalla is a must!!",positive
"Our first stay here in 2009 was on the very strong recommendation of Sri Lankan friends and we vowed to return sooner rather than later. Neither my wife or I recognised some of the negative comments on this site prior to booking our latest trip in December 2011 but we had some concerns. Those concerns were totally unfounded. From the moment we were met with refreshing cinnamon tea until the redoubtable Dudley packed our cases in the car at the end of our stay, it was total relaxation. The attitude of the staff is a delight and may explain some of the complaints - they have a wonderful ability of being remarkably attentive whilst appearing to be laid back which may be misinterpreted as appearing not to care.Nothing could be further from the truth. Some of the younger staff members are still extremely keen and their enthusiasm, whilst appreciated, intrudes slightly into the relaxed ambiance. They could do well to learn from Jacob. If you have the good fortune to have your table served by this gentleman you will understand the point I'm attempting to make. He is like a swan gliding serenely on the surface whilst away from view he is paddling like hell to ensure that you enjoy every minute in his care. Our room was excellent - the only criticism we could make was the that the Venetian blind in the bathroom was past its best.... this is really struggling to be negative. I can't believe that someone on here had complained about the food - how absurd! Not only was the buffet absolutely first class but the puddings were out of this world. A real trip down memory lane for persons of a certain age! Unsurprisingly, the dessert table won first prize in the hotel industry awards. Please don't take my word for this - our visit coincided with that of an annual trip of French gamblers(???!) to the hotel. They attacked each meal with that Gallic gusto which is unique, (complete with napkins tied around their necks!) - if it hadn't been up to standard I'm sure that it would have been the kitchen staff at risk rather than the food! When these lovely characters found that my wife was multi-lingual they hijacked her on a regular basis to tell the hotel chefs of their appreciation. Another negative comment I had read was regarding the beach folk. Yes, at times they can be boorish but they are trying to make a living. If you inform them that you are definitely not interested in purchasing anything today they will leave you alone. You are, however, missing the opportunity to chat to some fascinating people with experiences completely different to your own who would really appreciate the opportunity of honing their language skills on you - this is especially true of the clothing ladies. If all else fails the magic word to use is 'yanda!' whose interpretation is, I believe as rude as it is effective! We would like to thank the management team of Rifan (General Manager), Tilleth (Food and Beverage Manager) and above all the professional and gregarious Sampath (Assistant Manager) for a superb stay. You have staff and a hotel to be very proud of.",negative
"I stayed in this place for few days.. The beach was great and the pool quite never ending . I was really sure if this was a 5 star property , since the gym was absolutely poor and spread for lunch / dinner was quite limited . Overall its a great place to relax and enjoy the beach.",positive
This is a superb hotel in southern coastal area in SL. All are great. Foods were fanastic. There are lot of varities to select. Location is also really good. Should request a room on sea side. So that you can enjoy. This is one best Aitkence Spence Hotel. Night you can enjoy music as well as dance. I recomond this hotel to anyone.,positive
"We stayed here 5 nights and had a great time, from the greeting to the departure we were made to feel very well looked after. The hotel is amazing and the buffet is probably to best out of all the hotels we stayed at in Sri Lanka. We had a dinner arranged on the beach and the Chef was great, he sat down with us and planned our 6 course meal, we did say that 3 course would be enough but he isisted and it was expensive (£150 with a bottle of sparkling wine- huge amount for a meal in Sri Lanka let alone England) but it was a 5* meal and very memorable. One of the staff members -Amenka was very helpful, always going that extra step- providing us with some local knowledge of Colombo for the later part of our trip. We were going to go Whale watching but the cost of this would have been £100 for the boat and the trip and £50 for the taxi- which we couldn't understand, the cab wouldn't be £50 in London so why so much in Sri Lanka, esp when we hired a driver for the first week of the holiday who drove us everywhere for about £100 for the week! Basically the hotel is expensive theres nothing to do in the local area, so I wouldnt recommend this if you want a taste of Sri Lankan life. The cocktails were disappointing, they had a good selection but they were not well trained in the art of cocktail making, I even asked them to make me a simple cocktail which a child could make (Whisky, lemonade, Sweet Vermouth and Agusto bitters) they put fresh lime instead of lemonade, when I told them they got it wrong they didnt understand and then said they would add lemonade on top- whisky with lime is not a good mix and lemonade wont fix it but I was still asked to pay for this undrinkable concoction! The other annoying thing is that we chose this Hotel as it is apparantly secluded but this doesn't stop the locals waiting at the border of the pool trying to get your attention throughout every day! selling anything from coconuts to sarongs or even advice!!! The top hotels in Sri Lanka seem to add on a charge to all bills which is misleading, the fine print on the menu says 10% service charge and Govt taxes, I looked into it and Govt charges are 12% but this hotel charges a total of 25.7% instead of 23.2%. Other hotels we went to charge up to 28%, we asked the cashier and he just smirked and said its another Govt charge! which it clearly is not, I felt bad about this as in effect the hotel keeps the ""10%"" (really about 12.2%!!!) service charge and the workers get no tips which is unfair. All in all a great trip and a wonderful hotel just a shame that its not really secluded and if they owned the beach and got rid of the locals it would be a fantastic retreat.",positive
"Had mixed feelings about the hotels. I was not bad but was never 5 star. The check in could have been done in a more pleasing manner. The staff was too harsh, not even with a proper smile on the face to welcome the guests. The much needed cold towels were not provided. We stayed in a standard room and is quite ok though three's nothing outstanding. The furniture was of good quality and the rooms had a prestigious look. We stayed in a tripple and the extra bed was a total disappointment. The mattress was terrible. The verandah of the room was nice and big. Toothbrushes, tooth pastes and a shaving kit was missing in the room. I had to give a few calls to get them to my room. there was central air conditioning with temperature control, but yet the temperature controller seemed not to work right. The bathroom was ok but could have been bit more large. The common areas of the second and the third floor was neither air conditioned nor had proper ventilation. So you can hardly relax on a sofa there. the food was good. had nice sea food. But need to have a few notches up to get it to 5 star level. The service was terrible. the staff is too harsh. No body has a smile on their face and you would have a real unpleasant situation. Those in the dining were ignorant of the guest's needs. During the dinner I had to ask five times to get a bottle of water. They take hours to prepare a new table. A really inefficient staff lacking the professionalism. The two pools were really good. both really large and well maintained. The green pool has a great privacy and is much better than the main one. That of course is 5 star. The towels by the pools were too old and doesnt sute for the five star quality. If you are finding some nice hotel to stay near Galle and if your budget permits the best would be the ""The Fortress"" Koggala and even the light house hotel may do better.",neutral
"Stayed in September 2011 and was so impressed with this hotel that we have just returned from a further stay in December 2011.... Both stays have been excellent and exceeded our expectations. The hotel itself is extremely well kept to an excellent standard and the rooms are spotlessly clean. Staff are all very friendly and looked after us brilliantly - nothing is too much trouble! The food in the hotel can genuinely be described as fine dining and was lovely. We are in no doubt that this hotel is more than worthly of its star rating - ignore the few negative reviews here, you will have a relaxing time in a 1st class hotel! Looking forward to visiting again - Cherry and Dave (Nailsea, England).",positive
"architecturally very well set out right on the beach. very helpful reception staff but our room was dark and musty though when we complained a very nice room was provided. Buffet dinner was very over priced for those not on a inclusive budget and second rate anyway. After some hesitation an a la carte menu was provided in the non smoking air conditioned dining room, although at first told we should join the smokers on the terrace for this menu. The first two dinners we had were overcooked and poor and cold. A complaint to the restaurant manager brought a superb meal the next night. The message about this hotel is be prepared to complain and you will not be disappointed, when a complaint is made the staff can be very helpful.",positive
We had a great time at Heritance Ahungalla from the time we stepped in. The rooms were lovely & the bathroom was earthy & nice. Very clean. Staff was great... very attentive & patient .To my utter dismay I managed to misplace my room key & was very upset but the front desk was very helpful & provided me with a tag & every time I requested for a person to be sent to open my room they were there though it was my mistake!! Finally they found the key for me!!! Food was great & a nice spread especially for dinner & breakfast. I'm a bit difficult to please being a strict vegetarian but they were very helpful. The ocean was the best!!!!!! Never seen such amazing waves..... I was not very keen on Bentota as most part of the beach in Bentota is not as nice as the east or the south but the ocean made up for all that & made me glad that I chose it. You could just literally walk in to the waves as the water is shallow till you reach a far point & then the gorgeous waves hit you 'bang'!! I'm sure it's great for the surfers too. We had a wonderful stay. Thank you.,positive
"We had such a fantastic time at Heritance Ahungalle, the food, the service and the staff were fantastic. When i did my research before our trip to SL and came across the reviews in this site and i was a bit worried about staying at Ahungalle, BUT my partner and i had an amazing time at Ahungalle. so thank you to the fantastic team for making our stay at Ahungalle really special. The staff was very pleasant and helpful and the food really great. Thank you to all at Ahungalle for a fantastic stay! We will definetely stay at Ahungalle again when we visit SL next year.

"We arrived at Heritance Ahungalla on a rainy day and the service from the time of arrival was superb! The rooms are clean, and has all comforts some one can ask for.

"I stayed here in Feb 2011, near to the end of what had been a wonderful trip; but its seems nowt has changed, Staff were not too friendly as we'd experienced in rest of country, the whole hotel had an worn tired feel, the restaurant dark and hot, moved to outside tables for breakfast to sit with dirty table clothes even worse service but plenty of flies for company, asked at least 6 times to turn fans on but never did happen, oh and someone died while there - not sure if that was waiting?",negative
"Read some disppointing reviews here in the 2 or 3 weeks leading up to my holiday. I have travelled widely and stayed in some great hotels so I am not so easy to please, however I found that the Heritance was generally well run, staff were friendly and the room and amentities were of a good standard. I think you have to take into account that a country like Sri Lanka faces certain climatic conditions which means that the upkeep of any property would be a challenge, and creating something sympathetic to its environment and culture is difficult when you are trying to offer 5 star style services. So... Staff - unfailingly sweet and helpful. Not 5 star service but a very well meaning 4 star effort I would say. Only gripe was down at the beach area where there is a constant crowd of people trying to sell saris. massages, horse rides, you name it they were selling it. A number of security guards patrol this zone but I found them quite annoying in their own right and one of them approached me a couple of times on BEHALF of the beach vendors! If you said no I don't want a sari then the same person would ask if you wanted to visit his restaurant or have a massage or whatever. The hassle was constant. I think the hotel needs to train its security guards better so that they don't add to the problem. Beach area - I went on the beach only once and was hassled for all 100 metres of my walk. There was a red flag out the entire time I was there and frankly the sea was way too rough to even paddle in. Area was beautiful though. No sunbeds, presumably for all the reasons above. Pool areas - I used the ""Green Pool"". It was quieter than the main pool where a lot of noisy families and groups tended to congregate. Pools were both lovely, huge, clean and inviting. 5 star here. Restaurants - I ate a la carte every night in either the Coffee Shop or the fine dining restaurant. Both were good. Only thing was of course they were very very quiet (I was the only diner in the fine dining restaurant one evening) because most people use the buffet restaurant. I didn't go here in the evenings for 2 reasons. 1 - as I was on my own the staff would always try to tuck me away into a corner by the service area 2 - too many noisy children (really very loud indeed). I did have breakfast in the buffet restaurant and food was varied and delicious. I would say 4 star overall in this regard. Room - I had a standard room. It was large and well set out, great bathroom and shower. Air con was second to none. All spotless. Pillows were those nasty foam things though, but the bed was good otherwise. It did annoy me that the room was still being cleaned when I checked in at 6pm. I mean, they had 6 hours between turfing the last occupants out and my arrival!! As a result I had to sit in the room whilst they cleaned around me. I couldn't even use the bathroom after my very long trip. Gym - well equipped. But the air con was non existant. They have 2 small units for quite a big room with 2 fully glass walls, so it gets pretty hot in there. One of those units was broken for the duration of my stay and fixed the day I left. All equipment is in working order, but I would say that they could do with a couple of new treadmills pretty soon. I saw people in there working out in flip flops (always annoys me as it brings sand into the gym and gets into equipment) - the instructor was nowhere to be seen. On a couple of occasions I noticed that the instructor and other entertainment staff seem to congregate in the gym to watch the tv. I didn't visit the spa but the spa menu looked appealing and not too toppy. Nor did I visit the nightclub. The only shop on site is a gem shop and there was quite a hard sell if you so much as approached it. Reception - managed to give me a 4 am wake up call 1 day early. Pleased... I was NOT! They were very sorry about it of course. Check in was a bit slow (in retrospect they were probably trying to delay my discovering that the room wasn't ready). My welcome drink took ages to arrive and when it did the reception man reappeared and took me to my room before I could drink it! They were very helpful in giving me access to the internet though (free in the library area on the 3rd floor). All in all I would go back and I would recommend to my friends. The area is lacking in any other real amentities (a few very unappealing local shops outside and a busy main road to contend with) AND it is about 3 1/2 hours from the airport - that really adds to the long trip from the UK. But I guess you have to make an effort to get really good things and this is an effort I would definitely include in a future itinerary.",positive
"We just got back from Ahungalla one of 3 hotels we stayed at in Sri Lanka, we spent the first few days of our holiday travelling around and then 4 nights here. Quite frankly I cannot believe the rubbish some nit pickers write on here. The hotel is amazing, the setting is gorgeous and the staff are the friendliest we met. All the staff are very well trained and could not help us enough very approachable. The room was clean and kept clean daily by housekeeping who did an outstanding job. The A/C worked wonders and our room was a constant cool haven from the outside temperatures. We were on a half board basis and ate every day at the resturant. I found the variety good and my husband enjoyed all the local dishes, even on a day when i couldnt find a meal to my taste the kitchen prepared me something just for me. We were completely content in the hotel and only left once for a small shopping trip. I haved stayed in a variety of hotels in other countried but this was my first time to Sri Lanka, I was unsure what to expect but was completely happy with my hotel choices and the country a fab holiday.",positive
"I and my wife thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel during 3rd week of Nov 2011. All staff from Management to porters were very accommodating, and helpful. We would like to thank Assistant Manager Sampath DeSilva for ensuring that we had an enjoyable experience at the hotel. Also like to extend our thanks to Thushara Gnanarathne for providing us with excellent vegetarian meals at short notice. We were very happy with our executive room with sea views, always tidied and refreshed with clean towels, linen etc.and fresh fruits on the table. For this we wish to extend our thanks to the housekeeper Nilanga Weeraratne. Considering 5 star status, we must say that there is room for further improvements to recreational facilities. Hotel is in a nice location close to the beach and the infinity pool is great. Excellent choice of meals at breakfast, lunch and dinner makes it a great destination for adults and children alike. The sandy beach is nice and clean, sea can be rough at times, but overall we enjoyed the beach. Particularly at sunset time we have managed to take some very colourful, picturesque photos to remind us of this wonderful break in SriLanka.",positive
"This is a strange one, to be sure. With a few tweeks it could be one of the best beach hotels you'll ever stay in anywhere, but in the comparison with other places we stayed in Sri Lanka (and particularly Mount Lavinia), it just seems to fall short in areas that it would be so easy to correct. The setting, design and physical feel of the hotel are all quite stunning. But right away you get those little irksome contrasts that make this a frustrating place. Complacency abounds and you sense that they are still all patting themselves on the back for being able to re-open after the devastation of the Tsunami (yes those dreadful Youtube videos from Boxing Day 2004 were from balconies at The Triton, which has now become The Heritance). Positive sentiment isn't quite enough at the 5 star level unfortunately. It sits behind a gorgeous stretch of beach with surf that you just are dying to play in just 50 feet away - but to get from hotel gardens to the sea, you have to pass an almost comically persistent group of beach tradespeople each time. The hotel has a line of flags to keep them at bay, but the security staff still let them bother you from a distance when you are on a sun lounger by the pool. Would you get accosted by a panhandler on the steps of the Waldorf Astoria as you left to get in your cab? The sidewalk is public space but things can be done..... The two pools are large and magnificent, with the green pool so huge it even allows you to ""length swim"". There is also a gym with fairly up to date equipment, but its functionality was comprised every day of my stay by an inability of staff to get the message (despite 3 reminders in 3 days) that the aircon needs to be on and set to below 28 degs C for anyone to be able to use it. The minimalist design of the public areas has an overall calming effect on you, but with the architect apparently having a veto on everything, this extends to a lack of many of the features that you expect in any large resort - an excursions / news board; signs to different areas; names on the bars etc. We had little to complain about the food. In fact it was fairly reasonably priced for a putative 5 star, but it had little real wow factor, and apart from some of the local dishes on the buffet menu, it just scraped by. Last year we stayed on Meeru Island resort in the Maldives and despite the obvious abundance of produce in Sri Lanka compared to a coral attol, Meeru's buffets were both more inspiring and much cheaper. The room was spacious with a big balcony - as it should be for just over $300 a night! But the bathroom was blatantly unfinished with two walls smooth plastered but not painted. Some guests demanded a room change for this - we were told it was a design feature (see photo). With such a huge balcony a sun lounger rather than just 2 chairs and a table would have been an idea. And why oh why was there no rack to dry wet clothes. There was plenty of space, but maybe the architect had his say there as well. All the staff we interacted with were cheerful and accommodating, apart from the reception staff who were a bit feckless and needed to be a little more proactive. We were invited to a cocktail party given by the assistant manager, and found him charming and with an earnest concerned approach to some of the criticisms we gently raised. It really did not sit well however to be told that the beach sellers were tolerated on a ""better the devil you know"" basis and that other ""newer"" nationalities amongst the clientele liked having them around. I am not so sure the Heritance is that well advised to try to imitate Sharm El Sheikh at these prices. Lose the traditional customer base and I think they will lose much of their trade to the likes of Mount Lavinia. If you were to stay here and, as we are, you are fairly easy going if the weather is good, (as it was), you will probably be happy enough at the Heritance, give or take the $100 or so a night that should still be in your wallet. But I can imagine it could quite quickly become a nightmare in bad weather. You even had to pay to play on the pool table. Free pool if you spend 1500 rupees on drinks - come on! To end on a positive note of a review which I had intended to be somewhat more complimentary than it has turned out, the laissez-faire approach has allowed wildlife to remain on the grounds undisturbed. To see massive Iguanas digging for crabs next to your sun-lounger while chipmunks frolic around on your umbrella stand is a uniquely warming feeling. We were even able to film troupes of monkeys and even pass them mango pieces to eat on the branches of trees by the pool. Enchanting.",neutral
"The Heritance Ahungalla is NOT a five or a four star. Was traveling with my older parents and children. The AC and lights in my parents room was not working, it took 3 hours, 3 phone calls and a conversion with a guy at the reception for someone to come and fix this. 2 strange men in the room fixing the AC and lights for 45 minutes. Moerover, the staff by the poolside is terribly slow. Hotel common areas are dirty. Saw used diapers and used band aids by the pool! Took them forever to ask for food and drinks. They did not even have mint to make certain cocktails! Ran out apparently. I would rate this as a 3 star, and nothing more. Will not return. Diasppointed. Waste of money.",negative
"We stayed at the Heritance Kandalama and were expecting the same high standard we had there. Unfortuantely we were very dissapointed by the Ahungalla. How this hotel managed to win an award I will never know! The hotel is dirty and tired and the service at breakfast is worth a special mention for all the wrong reasons. Dirty tables left uncleared for hours, the most disgusting tea and coffee I have ever tasted in my entire life and service without a smile. The only thing positive I have to say about the hotel is its location and the morning walk you can take along the stretch of beach on your door step. However, a word of warning, there are beach sellers who try to befriend (hassle) you about every 20 mins so go for your walk early before they get up!! All I can say is thank goodness we didnt spend our entire stay here!",negative
"Property: Whole Hotel is situated in a calm and quiet property... Though secluded from the city of colombo... you can manage to get all necessities if you travel in very short distance... Service: Service within hotel is not good... They need to stick to basics... * There was lint on the bed sheets from the cushions and the comforter... * There was no shampoo in the bath, on asking i was informed shampoo and bath gel is one and the same... When asked whether the person claiming so was sure about it... he returned with shampoo... * You are given seat in restaurant however you are not served water until you ask for it... You have to remind the attendants to refill water more than once... * Language is a problem, however all the people try their best to communicate... Thumbs Up: GEMS and Jewel Shop is pretty good...",neutral
"We stayed at 2 other Heritance hotels which were fantastic, so we were bitterly disappointed by the Ahungalla. Service was consistently terrible, filthy mattresses on the sun loungers (they looked like something that belonged in a sri lankan prison), no soap in the toilets, dinning room so dark another guest actually bought a torch to see their food.",negative
"Okay it's one of the best hotel is Sri Lanka, it has won the award of best leisure hotel by the minister of tourism. Sure, the two pools are outstanding, the rooms are nice, the area is quiet and the beach is nice but... staying there we kept asking ourselves: is it how one should experience Sri Lanka beaches? Just before we stayed at Mirissa, a lovely beach with a lot of atmosphere, a couple small hotels and guest houses, a few waterfront bars and a great laid back atmosphere. The Heritance is the opposite. Big resort where you pay over-priced drink and food served by stylish staff. The hotel probably owns the beach, because there is nothing else around. Would advice to go there if you don't mind missing the charm of more ""informal places"". Compare to other places, we found the contact with the locals to be biased. It's either hotel staff or very insisting beach sellers. The later can be quite annoying especially when the seat in group of 8-10 just in front of your chair and stay all day long. The food was not exceptional, certainly not in line with the price they ask for it (in Sri Lankan terms of course!).",neutral
"Nice beach hotel with 2 big swimming ball, service is nice, in the first day I went with my wife to the beach and enjoyed watching the waves but i had a problem with 3 of the citizens they came to me and circled me and my wife I think they want to steal my money, the taxi driver warn me about these bad people near the beach, they spoke to me in english and offered me a drink and a dinner in thier restaurant, I managed to escape from them by promising them in the next day I may visit them in thier restaurant. they allow me to go and in the next day morning I found them waiting for me, I refused to go to them. The hotel should notify all the visitors about these king of people for security reasons. the food is fantastic. don't miss it.",positive
"My now Husband and I stayed at Heritance Ahungalla for our wedding in Sept 2011, we were there for two weeks. We had been upgraded to a large room, 258. This was overlooking the green (residents) pool. the room was very spacious and with a huge bed. It was nice to have two seperate sinks and a bath. i would agree with some others that the smellies in the bathrooms are a bit thick and difficult to get out of the ceramic bottles. It was nice to have a sitting area. We didn't make full use of the balcony but it was nice to sit out there a few afternoons. We stayed on a B&B basis, which suited us. Breakfast is a good buffet, with meats, cheese, fruit, curries and an assortment of other items. There are chef's who will cook you an omlette, waffle, boiled eggs all to your specifications. Staff bring tea and coffee to your table, unsuprisingly the tea is gorgeous and my mother inlaw said the coffee was good. A little tip, if you like several cups of tea in the morning then ask for a pot for the table, the waiters will leave one and some milk. The pools are lovely to relax by and the pool staff are very helpful with bringing matresses and towels and moving the beds for you. It is interesting to chat to Bali and Sunnil (Older pool staff) as Sunnil has worked in the hotle for 30 years and Bali for 19 years. The nights we ate in the hotel we ate in the coffee shop. Lovely relaxed atmosphere and food a reasonable price. I would suggest if in a group order some of the curries with accompaniments, 1000 rupees but loads and the rest of the group said the curries were good, if hotter than most othe curries that were eaten. the chefs will change a dish if required but if you say mild, this may not be as mild as you would like. Staff were always friendly and helpful. The hotel was quite quiet whilst we were there and pretty much every member of staff was aware that we were there for our wedding. For anyone looking at getting married in Sri Lanka we can only say go for it. Especially at Heritance Ahungalla. Staff organised everything wonderfully. Buila (wedding co-ordinator) was great. So much easier than getting married in the UK. Also not everyone can say they have an elephant at their wedding. Special thanks to KK (food and beverage manager) and Chef Kasan. They organised our meal for us and our 7 guests. The food was stunning and again no problems to change the menu. A family joke is my love for the father in laws cauliflower cheese, so they made some especially. Also my friend doesn't drink tea or coffee but does peppermint tea, mint appeared to be hard to get hold of so KK had some secreted away in the kitchen and whenever my friend wanted mint leaves in hot water it was there. The beach sellers can be a littlein your face but a polite no is normally ok. There are lots of people around who will offer you tours etc. I would say go with your gut instinct and if you like someone then go with them. The hotel does get busy at weekends as special rates are offered to Sri lankan nationals and whilst we were there 2 conferences took place. The spa is lovely but not the cheapest. I had a package of massage, body scrub and facial. the treatment took just under 3 hours and cost £100. We would definatley return to Heritance Ahungalla. Especially to see how our coconut tree is going that we planted as part of our wedding package. P.S if anyone is thinking of getting married her please feel free to PM us.",positive
"Good hotel, great food, well trained staff but very quiet in the low season. Stayed in the famous room 305 with its huge balcony! Peaceful location but the beach sellers can be rather too persistent. We bought sarong, dress and skirt and used them for tuk tuk journeys to bentota where we also had a suit made, bought jewellery and local crafts. Despite this we were being pressured to book trips with them. We had already made arrangements with Rammuni Tours (who were excellent by the way)and since it was the low season there was not enough tourists to go round resulting in us trying to hide from them when by the pool! Both weekends the hotel was full of Sri lankans which was fine but they farmed us out to the shabby banqueting suite for our evening meal on the first weekend. We had just returned from our overnight trip to kandy only to find a small buffet set up with cold food and tables with chairs that seemed too low for the table. This was the only time we complained since the room was definitely not 5 star. We were allowed to use the main restaurant after that. It was much busier of course but we preferred this to feeling excluded. A special mention goes to Nayagar the trainee in the Jute restaurant - she always had a welcome smile on her face and made us feel very comfortable. We saw an English wedding being held on the lawn at the front of the hotel. An elephant was brought to hotel and it followed the bride on her walk to the alter! It all appeared to go very well and fireworks had been arranged for the wedding party in the evening.",positive
"My fiancé & I stayed here for 3 days at the end of a tour of Sri Lanka. It was pure bliss; we only left the hotel once to go to the turtle farm. The service is fantastic, food amazing and very reasonable/cheap in the coffee shop with exceptional quality. The rice & curries for 1000rps is great value. We just walked the beach and use the pool all day. Such a relaxed atmosphere in the hotel. It also has the best sun set I have ever seen. Would strongly recommend.",positive
"Heritance Ahungalla is a lovely hotel, designed by renowned architect Geoffrey Bawa and situated on a beautiful stretch of beach about 80km from Colombo. The rooms are well equipped and furnished with great ocean views. Food is simply amazing and has something to offer every taste bud. The service offered was beyond expectations, and would gladly commend the staff, who were extremely helpful and capably obliging. There are 2 swimming pools and a common area jacuzzi and other activities that will keep you occupied if you're on long stay. While you're at it, check out the DIviyan spa as well. Had an amazingly relaxed time and awesome Balinese massage, from genuine therapists from Bali. Definitely one of the best hotels in Sri Lanka!",positive
We stayed in this hotel during our honeymoon in 2009. Very nice hotel to relax near the beach with an excellent pool. During the night time they had local cultural dance festival as well.,positive
"My husband and I stayed at the Heritance Ahungalla in July for 2 weeks for our honeymoon. The hotel is about two hours away from the airport and the journey there can be quite hair-raising due to how the Sri-Lankans drive - be aware!!! On arriving at the hotel we were early, check in is normally 2pm however our travel company had warned them that we would be early and so a room was ready for us. Being honeymooners the hotel upgraded our standard room to a luxury suite and provided us with complimentary wine and fruit. The room itself was number 205. The room was very spacious with two single beds pushed together (not great for honeymooners!!), a living area and the biggest balcony I have ever seen, which overlooked the pool on one side and the beach on the other side. The bathroom was also huge and had both a bath and a rainforest shower. Complimentary toiletries were given however these were in bottles and were hard to get out (tip-put hot water in the bottle as well and this will loosen up the liquid). The towels in the room were changed twice a day and there was a bed turning down service. The room was always cleaned to a high standard. I would however say that aspects of the room could do with being re-painted or upgraded a bit, the air conditioning leaked, paint was chipping off walls and the table and chairs on the balcony really needed varnishing badly however these were minor details that did not put us off. The hotel itself is massive and completely open plan. As soon as you are driven up the massive driveway you can see the sea through the open plan reception, absolutely stunning! There are 2 swimming pools, one by the reception which was like an infinity pool overlooking the beach and the other was a quieter pool towards the rear of the property. We tended to choose this pool as it was quieter. The pool attendants could not have been more helpful, they position your sunlounger as you like it, provide towels and are so friendly. As well as this there is a bar attendant who will serve you food and drinks at your sunlounger. Perfect! There is also a jacuzzi by the pool which runs from 8am-midday and 4pm-8pm, lovely! There is also a gym which is open 24/7 and has all the machines you could possibly need. The beach is a massive, beautiful beach. When we were there the sea was too rough to swim in but we paddled in it and it was the warmest sea I have ever felt. You will have locals trying to sell you things on the beach but they are all very friendly and it is easier to say no to them straight away otherwise you will not be left alone for a second. We ate in the coffee shop most evening but we also tried the jute buffet restaurant. Although both were good I would recommend the coffee shop over the buffet. The buffet has a different theme every night and there is always a fantastic selection of food however we prefered the atmosphere andbeing outdoors at the coffee shop. A personal favourite of ours was the samosa starter, delicious! The prices were typical prices for a 5* hotel but if you think Sri Lanka is cheap, it is not at this hotel. The location of the hotel is not particularly great. There are no hotels nearby and there is relatively little to do in the immediate area. We did go on a trip organised by Kuoni which was a boat trip to an island where cinnamon was made. We had such a fantastic time on this trip, saw lots of wildlife and the people who made the cinnamon etc were lovely and did not pressurise you at all to buy anything. We also went to the turtle hatchery and it was lovely to hold the baby turtles. Thoroughly recommend this trip. Finally other people have said that check out was slow, we did not experience this at all, it was very quick and efficient, no problems. All in all I would recommend this hotel to families, couples, solo travellers, business people...anyone! It may not be a european 5* standard but it certainly is a gorgeous, clean hotel with friendly, helpful staff and I can guarantee you will have a lovely holiday here.",positive
"This hotel has actually been given 4.5 stars not 5 by some tour operators and I would say it is worth the 4.5 stars. I am unable to see why people have little gripes about the Heritance as no holiday is perfect. The service here was excellent especially in the main restaurant (jute), room service and around the pool areas where there was no shortage of beds or brollies was an excellent service The room was spacious and spotlessly clean. There was a big shower so if you want an upgraded room with a bath you should expect to pay for it nothing in life is free. Swimming pools and jacuzzi fab as quite big. Reception staff, money exchange all gave a good service. Staff very friendly, happy and willing. Service can be slow but people must understand this is the Sri Lankan culture so if you want fast food go to Macdonalds. The chap complaining about the price of the coffee if he doesn't want 5 star prices then go to a 3 star hotel. Yes the prices were a bit on the high side for Sri lanka. the buffet cost about £17 each but was worth it. The Mustard a la carte restaurant was excellent and cheaper. Menu in the Mustard was a little limited, as was the room service menu but one could usually find something to eat. The Mirror Coffee shop perhaps could have been a bit better as the menu was similar to the Mustard Restaurant and room service menus and yes the cappucino could have been better and gateau of the day was always chocolate but this is Sri Lanka not New York. The hotel was adept at handling weddings conferences you name it without impacting on the service which still remained first class however many guests stayed. There were a lot of locals staying over the weekend but this wasn't a problem as they were in the other pool so it wasn't overcrowded. The only drawback which wasn't the hotel's fault I thought was the location. There were no hotels nearby and as soon as you stepped outside the main entrance you were seriously pounced on by people wanting this that and the other. I have visited Lanka 6 times and this is the worst scenario for this ever. The gym was well equipped and had air con. The animation team did very little and seemed very unanimated but I am sure if you really wanted to do an activity you could approach them as they did not really ask you to take part in anything. We did the River trip but it was a bit disappointing as we saw a few jellyfish a kingfisher and about three different birds. On the trip saw Cinnamon Island briefly an old man telling us how cinnamon is processed. Picture a scrawny chicken running around, skinny man so we bought some cinnamon then walked past his hut and he had a bigger tv than me! Yala safari very enjoyable booked through Tui who use Aitken Spence. We also did Bindali bird park during the trip which is next to Yala but think shouldn't have bothered as saw various birds and animals at Yala which were also at Bindali so Yala would have been sufficient. It was easy to relax at the |Heritance and we came back happy and chilled out. i would recommend anyone visiting Lanka for the first time to do a few days tour then a beach stay, otherwise day trips from the hotel can be a bit too far. I would recommend this hotel without any hesitation, to anyone thinking of staying there.",positive
"We decided head off to the Heritence Ahungalle for the Weekend with my Family and was blown away by its sheer size and creative architecture by the late world renowned Architect "" Geoffrey Bawa"" Our room was very clean and spacious and most importantly had a wonderful View overlooking the large Swimming Pool and the beach. However the only drawback in the room was the quality of the shampoos which came in small reusable ceramic bottles. I must say that with the shampoo consisting of thick liquid, I was unable to release it on to my hair despite giving it a good shake and strongly recommend that Visitors who patronize this Hotel bring there own shampoo. Visitors will not be short of outdoor activities with a Tennis and Badminton court in addition to a Swimming Pool available which helped me burn some calories after having a sumptuous meal offered by the award winning culinary chiefs at the Hotel. We were spotlit for choice with the variety of meals offered during breakfast , lunch and dinner which consisted of Sri Lankan and far eastern cuisine. However I noted that our table had either a fork, spoon or a glass missing had to bring it to the notice to the waiters who happily obliged and did the needful. While checking in is quite smooth, I cant say in the same breath about checking out especially when you have one cashier in the counter behind the front desk processing all payments which kept me waiting for a good 20 minutes and created a bad taste in an otherwise memorable holiday. From a Personal point view I can say that despite the small shortcomings the staff are very friendly and committed to making your holiday memorable which is good for this hotel in the long run. I would like to reserve a special word of thanks to the Security Guard who was on duty near the Badminton Court on the 17th of July for going out of his way to assist me borrow some badminton rackets at a time when the person in charge was not around.",positive
"I went to Heritance Ahungalla for my Honeymoon & It was unbeatable amazing. I would like to start off with the location as this will be the first thing to see... It was really easy to find as it was just off the Colombo - Galle main road. When you get in to the hotel it was just amazing as hotel is open to stunning swimming pool & to the beach. From the second we entered to the reception it was a great experience & within 1-2 minutes we had a welcome drink followed by warm greetings from hotel staff. Accommodation was great & I just informed once that I am coming for my honeymoon & the bed was nicely decorated & the en suite facilities we had were brilliant & everything was clean & neat. Food was excellent & more surprisingly restaurant team has arranged an outside special table arrangement for honeymoon dinner. I cannot expect any better service than this & how good their communication within the departments as I only informed to reservations that I am coming for my honeymoon & it’s been communicated through out to all department as housekeeping, restaurant, etc.... All I can say is that the every single minute I spent there was brilliant & the personal attention we had from the staff was amazing. There is no reason why I should suggest this hotel to someone who is looking for great beach resort experience & which is really value for money. I would like to thanks again for the team for giving us such a great experience on our honeymoon & I will definitely visit again in my next Sri Lanka trip.",positive
"We stayed one night as part of a tour of Sri Lanka. The hotel is lovely and is situated right on the beach, about 45 minutes drive from Galle. We happened to be there when the Sri Lankan and Aussie cricket teams were also staying there, which provided a bit of excitement (and incredible security). Our only gripe was being served a completely frozen samosa at dinner. Otherwise, a very good hotel.",positive
"went for a weekend away and had a wonderful exp. stayed at ahungalla twice before but got a luxury room this time around which was well worth it. the room was very spacious, with a lovely view. the service was great despite them being at full capacity ... the food was great. had dinner one evening at coffee shop/restaurant as we wanted a quieter evening and found the food in general was good not only the buffet however the atmosphere was hindered occasionally as there was a large noisy crowd from the two companies that had brought their staff on a company trip , if not for that factor it was a lovely relaxing and enjoyable stay",positive
"I have just had the experience of checking in my friend and his wife to the Heritance, it looked ok on the way in but the outlook is very sterile, having read most of the reviews about their coffee shop we eventually made it there after a labourious check in, I suggest to the management that they should send their coffee shop staff into the Capital city colombo to the almost genuine 5 star hotels to find out what a Capucino and a Cafe Latte is and how it is made and presented, we had 2 cups of ordinary coffee with a bit of milk froth on top and were charged the best part of 5 USD for this pathetic version of a Capucino and Latte, I don't mind paying 5 star prices but please please provide us with a 5 star cup of coffee, and how in heavens name do hotels classify themselves as 5 star, a ordinary 3 star hotel in Thailand will knock spots of any so called 5 star hotel in Sri Lanka, very very disappointed.",negative
"This hotel has been serving people i guess for more than two decades and it has never failed to impress me. The kind service, huge garden(coconut) lovely beach to play, great food, two lovely pools, and freedom from any mode of disturbance makes this a no 1 hotel in Sri Lanka. The buffet was wonderful, and being vegetarian it had quite an array for us too.",positive
"We spent two nights in this hotel and it was a fabulous experience. Apart from the great view of the ocean, the hotel has two great swimming pools. Its a great place to just relax and get away from the busy life. We wounld definitely vist this place again.",positive
"I stayed at the Heritance Ahungalla with my wife and two children as part of a two week stay in Sri Lanka - the first week in the ""cultural triangle"" and part of the second week on the coast in the Heritance property. It would be considered to be one of the best hotels in the region - and it didn't disappoint. We were greeted upon arrival with a welcome drink whilst looking over the swimming pool and onwards to the beach - only 5 metres beyond the edge of the infinity pool. A stunning vista which served to relax and excite in equal measure. The staff were wonderfully courteous as has been our experience with all the Sri Lankans we have come acorss during our stay. The country appears to be making great strides to come back from the political troubles it has been experiencing over the last 2 decades. Both the swimming pools were fantastic and the area was well complimented by very attentive pool staff. There are are a number of dining rooms however I only experienced the main buffet dining room due to being with a 13 and 4 year old. The variety and quality of food was very good. A special mention to KK, one of the F & B managers, who looked after us as if we were family! Perhaps he is a distant Sri Lankan cousin! Do try some of the Sri Lankan cuisine such as coconut sambol, string hoppers and any number of the curries - potatoe, egg..........wonderfully tasty, spicy and flavoursome. Take a wander down to the beach and sample the Indian Ocean - I've never experienced sea water as warm - anywhere in the World. You will be approached by local sellers of souvenirs - but like all Sri Lankan people, they are very gentle and will not intimidate you. We didn't take any of the Tours that were available for the region as we were just unwinding but there is a lot to do in the region including visiting turtle sanctuaries. In April, the weather was mixed - but due to the special atmosphere in the country, it really didn't appear to matter. It only lasted a couple of hours and then dried up almost as quickly as it arrived. In short, a wonderful few days break - we would definitely return.",positive
"Wonderful welcome after long journey,room was very clean and comfortable and remained so for entire holiday.We ate in hotel and found the food very good the staff in restaurant went out of their way to provide whatever we wanted even if it was not on menu.All hotel staff were freindly and helpful ,beautiful hotel will defintely return.",positive

The spa facility they have is breath taking. My wife and daughter loved it overlooking the see directly. Brilliantly located close to many places and Bentota for water activities. Swimming pool is marvelous and food is great.,positive
"The reception people are very depressing. They are not courteous, rude and I was shocked that this hotel belongs to a group of hotels and a large company. The Reception people really gave my family a soar welcome and ruined our mood. They are very suspicious and look at you like we are thieves. Maybe the Management have to start customer service classes and put the right people there.At least people who can smile. Also responsiveness of services is also slow overall.",negative
"Stayed in the hotel during my vacation to Sri Lanka on July. I stayed Cinnamon grand, Kandalama before Heritance Ahungalla. I don't know what make this hotel 5 star. I ordered 3 triple rooms but when I got to room they are double rooms. When asked they said they put another bed to make it triple. checked in at 4:30PM but didn't get third bed until 12:30AM. 12:30 AM !!!!. Every time I called they said they have asked housekeeping for the extra bed. Finally got third beds from drivers quarters. Very nasty bed with 2 inch mattress. Food is average not best. I've seen better verity in average buffets. Try a different hotel before considering this.",neutral
"We have just returned from a 10 day stay at this hotel where we also got married. Firstly I have to say that our wedding day was fantastic and everything was arranged perfectly for us thanks to Burla, the wedding co-ordinator at the hotel. She truely cared about giving us a day to remember. From the day we arrived Burla was attentive and supportive in making sure all of the arrangements were made for us. The hotel itself was lovely open style and very comfortable, making you feel instantly relaxed. The green pool area was lovely and the staff throughout the hotel were attentive and friendly. We had mainly in the buffet restaurant which we found had a great choice of food although at times the hot meals that werent being cooked for you at the time could have been hotter. The BBQ evening was fantastic. I would thoroughly recommend the Fine Dining restuarant. The food here was absolutely fantastic. We did a Elephant safari and a river safaru whilst in Sri Lanka which was also excellent. The only downside was the tim it takes to get to and from the airport around 2 and a half hours to do a relatively short journey however we did see the contsurction of the new highway which will hopefully help speed things up when thats complete. Overall I have to say we loved our stay in Sri Lanka and loved this hotel. We had a lovely holiday and a truly perfect wedding.",positive
"Good view of private beach from room, two good swimming pools and a jacuzzi But open only till 8 pm! Was served wrong wine, poor exchange rate, a baby girl fell down from above, ac had problems, very slow at check out! Overall a good experience but could be better if improvements are made to food quality, service and overall staff quality.",neutral
"The Heritance Ahungalle is a lovely hotel on the South Coast of Sri Lanka and I recently choose the hotel to propose to my girlfriend. I would like to take a moment and thank everyone for making it as special as possible. The only instruction I had made while making my reservation was for something nice and am glad the hotel had attended to the specifics! On arrival we were greeted with refreshments and then taken to the most lovely corner suite. The suite consists of a beautifully furnished lobby area, the bedroom, a large bathroom and a private terrace. The hotel had arranged a table with a flower arrangement on the terrace for lunch, the four-poster bed was decorated with a pattern made of red flower petals and a bubble bath had been drawn with a few red shoe-flowers to complete the ambiance. It was perfect and the best part was I hadn’t really requested anything. After a little time to unwind, lunch was served. Five kinds of bread and three varieties of butter were served with our starters. Followed by cream of tomato soup and passion fruit sorbet to cleanse the palate! As a vegetarian I was served very cheesy lasagna, while a seafood platter with lobster, tiger prawns, cuttle fish and fish was served to my girlfriend. A prelude to marriage was glimpsed as my girlfriend, enticed by the cheese left half the seafood to finish of my lasagna. After Ice cream sandwiches for dessert, tea / coffee and homemade chocolates, going down on one knee was a difficult task to manage. But manage I did and I proposed on a private terrace, overlooking the Indian Ocean. For one of the best days of my life and I would like to thank: • Shanaka and the Colombo team for arranging everything • Shyamalee Wijethilake and Kumara Karunaratne at the hotel • Praveen, who was our attentive waiter An ideal retreat for a romantic day by the sea.",positive
Stayed at the Heritance Ahungalla in December 2010 - was a fabulous stay with wonderful and attentive staff. We were upgraded to a suite with sea views and had fresh fruits delivered each day. The hotel is beautiful but the staff makes it the best stay. Special mention of KK. Highly recommended.,positive
"We visited during the Monsoon season in June 2011 but luckily the weather wa beautiful, the hotel had very few guests then but it was exactly what we needed, peace and quiet! The Pool is amazing and the staff is very friendly like everyone in Sri Lanka. They had few rennovation works going on during the low season but it was still ok. The hotel is located in Ahungalla which is a very small town but very close to Bentotta and reasonably close to Galle. We hired a Tuk Tuk driver who showed us around Bentotta and Galle, he asked for very reasonable charges and we always paid him double what he asked for. We enjoyed the trips in the red tuk tuk , Raja was very helpful and pleasant. He lives very close to the hotel and his mobile nb is 0094776954583",positive
"Located right on a beautiful and serene beach, this is a great property 2 hours south of Colombo. We had a very nice and relaxing time at this property. Teh ocean facing rooms were great. The people there were very friendly and took good care of us. The only issue i had was that the a/c's in the room was not working well.",positive
"A huge average tourist hotel. I would not call this place luxurious. Not sure if there are alternatives. If you can, skip this place. The beaches are not nice. Everything outside the hotel is depressing. They've had many years to fix, so there is no excuse for things looking so devastated and filthy after the Tsunami. Sorry, it's a real shame. The entire coast south and west looks terribly sad. I cannot in good conscience tell any of my friends to go there. There are so many poor people. Please give them employment and pay them to clean up the ENTIRE coast!",negative
"The staff were friendly and it was a lovely welcome. We had paid for half board but didnt realise this meant we could only eat in the buffet restaurant, we wanted to sample all the restaurants so negotiated a deal with the management. The Sri Lankan buffet night was brilliant but the rest of the time we preferred to have people waiting on us. The beach was a nightmare to walk along romantically as you always had a 3rd person there offering to take you on a trip somewhere. The entertainment at the hotel was brilliant. The cheeky chipmunks and lizardy things were ok once you got used to them wandering around and we had a group of monkeys in the trees outside our room which were good to watch! The room service wasnt good in the beginning as there was always something missing, we went on a day trip one day to come back late afternoon to find the breakfast tray still in the room and the room hadnt been done. I complained to the duty manager and he had a word with the room cleaner who came and apologised and things did improve. I would suggest that nothing at all however small is left out to avoid temptation, we all make sure we put valuables in the safe but it isnt always that sort of thing that goes missing. I lost some make-up and a book, they could have fallen into the bin. We went on a trip organised by a Trailfinders recomended company and he was fantastic. He fit the trip around us. We visited the turtle hatchery, the mask museum, the jewellery mine and the glass bottom boat.",positive
"We had a great time with our 8 month old baby.Pools,beaches are excellent.went to visit Kandy.beautiful trip. But never go with baby as it takes 6 hours to reach there from hotel.don't forget Stroller. Food is expensive.",neutral
"Was working in Sri Lanka and had the weekend to myself and managed to get a very good rate last minute for a very reasonable price (same as a HIE in uk) however full rate I think would be maybe not so worth it. Please note when I arrived they were doing quite a bit of rennovations (though this was being done discreetly and quietly to minimise effect to guests). However hotel was probably at least 50% empty. Hotel is a Geofrey Bawa Hotel (famous architect) and you can see his style throughout the hotel. Its not the usually glassy inpersonal type hotel that you can sometimes stay in - this hotel does have character for a large hotel. Though I think the hotel could do more to enhance this. Its quite a Large hotel with reasonable facilities. I went for a wander when I first arrived and everytime I turned a corner I seemed to find something new whether it was table tennis, to the table courts to a bars that are nicely spread out. Hotel itself is in lovely bay with some wonderful views. Overall I think it was a lovely stay however not quite as special as I thought it would be from hotel website. LOCATION Its roughtly 1.5 hours drive from Colombo, and probably a good 3 hours drive from airport. If you are suffering after a travelling you maybe want to do a stop over in Negombo near airport or Colombo city. Its slightly away from many of the overcrowded toursit areas like Bentota and this can have good and bad points. ARRIVAL When you arrive at the hotel - you are ushered to sit down and they bring over some refreshments whilst you sign in. It was nicely done - though I think if busy this may take some time, this si kind of usual for Sri lanka so be prepared for this and I take the time to wander a little or orders ome drinks. ROOM Room was well furnished and decorated - I had view of the back Pool and beach. Full AC and Fan. Please note room leads to an open plan corridor (very Geffrey Bawa - but this does mean at night you may get a few mosi's in your room when you open door or use the balacony so get them to spray your room before you go to bed and use the fan(mosi cant land on you if you have fan on) - I carry a can of baygon which you can buy in local shops to kill any mosi that may be hiding at night. Toilet was nicely done - though please note - no bath - which if you have children you may want to check on which rooms have baths. The toiletries were fine - but nothing to write home about - personally I prefer my own. Hairdryer in bathroom was good enough for ladies use. All seemed very clean and nice Wardrobe and draws, and space above draws doubles as suitcase stand. Beds were very comfortable, and sheets and towels all seemed fine and I had no complaints compared to other reviewers. Room had safe in wardrobe which seemed usual good hotel quality. There was a console desk for laptop and stuff. Kettle coffee/tea facilities. There was a very small mini frdge but it had no icebox which is a shame. Also please note alcohol apart from local beer is expensive - I would purchase what you need at duty free. Also in room large media cabinet - I am hoping they will look into flatscreens tv soon! Usual Sri Lankan Satellite available. I would have liked a DVD player. Also is small sofa and coffee table. Room had good lighting and I loved instaed of heavy curtains. they have light muslin nets curtain and then huge sliding panels which makes the room very dark and peaceful. The windows seemed to insulate reasonable well against outside although to be fair it was very quiet in any case. The balcony was usual standard - 2 seats and table. They gave free wifi FACILITIES Not bad for Sri Lankan hotel, but not quite up to a top western hotel. 2 very lovely pools, one with jacuzzi. tennis court (not sure whether in good state), table tennis, fitness room (nobody uses), pool/snooker tables (you pay for this about $1.5) 3 restaurants and quite a few bars, there is a games room and library however I never bothered to check this out. However no shops (its shutdown) jsut a jewerally shop. To get to anywhere you need to take a short drive. There is very lovely Spa with Indonesian ladies brought in specially - my advice - check this out - its lovely! FOOD I never bothered with restaurants - prefering to get room service. My first order a salad was so dissappointing - I had 1 lettuce leaf - I kid you not. However I peservered and everything else that came was lovely, and they even brought me cocktails and extra's to the room. However for half board price its probably better value to just eat the buffet on offer. I did do breakfast and was a good Sri Lankan buffet with plenty of variety from European, German, English, French to Sri Lankan curries. BEACH Beach is lovely - pretty clean when I went and is a very long bay. No packs of dogs and all very pretty. However annoying youths spoiled my walk by myself but the other locals when they heard were so horrified by rude behavious and apologised - which was very sweet. they even offered to accompany me at a distance so I could enjoy my walk without being bothered. SPA Well worth a visit on 1st day to help you get into holiday spirit of relaxation. Not Sri Lankan cheap but reasonable price by western prices. SERVICE It was quiet, however I thought service was very good. nicely balanced although I can see how some reviewers may get annoyed with the overfriendliness of some staff. Bless them they are on the whole very eager to make sure you enjoy yourself and you stay is good. I would rather have this than the rude obnoxious service you can get in the UK. Other points - Ground floor rooms - balcony is open to the grounds. Its perfectly safe - but with very young children this may be either a blessing or an issue. Also the ground floor rooms near the back swimming pool - may get noisy. If this is an issue I would mention it when you book or email hotel before your arrival. BOOKING OUT The bane of all Sri Lankan Hotels and this one is no exception - allow 20 mins at least to book out if its not busy and a lot longer if it is busy. I would suggest get them to organise bill whilst you finish packing up or having breakfast. OVERALL A really lovely hotel but perhaps not quite up to the image suggested on the glossy website (but maybe after rennovations??). However I actually preferred this to the Lighthouse near galle (another Geofrey Bawa hotel) due to service and has a certain something to it. Location is lovely and tranquil when I visited. Would I go back - most definately however 3-4 days would be my limit. Just not enough there yet.",neutral
"Ahungalla is a sea-side town about 2-3 hours from Colombo. Ahungalla Heritance resort was designed by Geoffrey Bawa, Sri Lanka's best known architect. As you arrive at the resort you are greeted by his signature style of blending the buildings with the natural environment. Lovely! We stayed in a luxury suite which was very spacious althougth the room's fittings are in need of an uplift. The housekeeping staff really let this hotel down! We called them 4 times for an extra towel which didn't arrive. The room was only turned down once for the 4 nights we were there. The room was a little grubby (stained rugs and cushions, dirty bathroom tiles.) The food was fantastic! Well prepared and a great variety. There are a lot of activities for guests to link into. Unfortunately the hotel rests on its reputation of winning architectual design and good food and has let that ""5 star"" service slip.",positive
"My (new) wife and i stayed here from 7th March till 14th March and had a fantastic time. We also got married here on the beach and would unreservedly recommend this hotel for a dream wedding. Right from when we first arrived we were amazed by the stunning location and the view from the lobby, over the eternity pool into the sea still sends shivers down my spine. We arrived early, so our rooms weren't ready but it didn't take long for us to be shown to our rooms (about the time it took to drink our coffee). The rooms were fantastic although a few minor things made us think it posssibly wasn't a 5star compared to British hotels. However, having not being used to this level of luxury we were very happy with our room. Large comfortable bed, spacious bathroom and working air con. The staff are very friendly and helpful and the food was just superb. Everyone should try the Sri Lankan food as we all found it magnificent. The wedding was spectacular with Kandyan drummers and dancers, a day we will never forget and are constantly boring everyone we meet with stories of how good it was. A special mention to Sarah for her help organising the wedding, especially as we found out later the girl who normally does it was ill and she was standing in. The pool boys were very good, you were never waiting long for beds and there was always barmen about you could order from. It was amazing to see a lizard every day wandering about the grounds looking for insects in the dirt, just added to the blissed out charm. It is a very good location for visits to Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery and the town of Ambalongoda. I could go on and on and on but summing up we can't wait to get back as soon as we can and miss the hotel and Sri Lanka every day",positive
"What a fabulous hotel. What a great place to get married. The service in this hotel far exceeds anything we have experienced in the UK. Truly amazing. When we arrived at 9pm, tired and jaded after 8 hours in a minibus, Bieulla our wedding organiser greeted us with flowers and a warm welcome. The next day she walked us through our options, where to get married, flowers, cake etc. Reassured us about everything and said she would be with us on the day right the way through. On the day she even helped with Michelle's hair. The dancers were amazing, the ceremony on the beach was stunning. There were even a couple of hotel guests crying! we finished up by leaving in the sunset on elephant back. We were full of small doubts when we arrived, the hotel gave us such service that we were 500% more than satisfied than what we expected. Brilliant, highly recommended. Thanks Bieulla, and everyone at the Hotel.",positive
"Is this a 5 star hotel?? The hotel is not well maintained. Staff are not professional. Service not up to standard. Waited for 20 mins to get towels and sun bed at the pool area, yet nobody came. Had to go to front desk to ask if anyone working around the pool. Staff standing around in groups, not interested in attending to guests.",negative
"The Problem with Hotels on the East coast, is that they are close to the main road. Less than 20 meters. This means you cannot get away from the noise of the buses and hooting that is so prevelant in the country. Heritance is more than 200 m away from the road and therefore away from the hussel and bussel of the surrounding area. You acutally feel like you are in a quiet tropical location. You hear the birds and natural noises. The Hotel itself is stunning, Geoff Bawa, the architect definately got the right balance between building and embracing nature. The nutaral colours the blending of building with nauture is appreciated. The beaches are clean and there is a lot of beach to cover so you do not feel onto of other tourists there. The waves were fun and water temp pefrect. The only blemish is the constant harrassment of locals trying to sell you clothing or go to their resturants. The staff are excellent and well trained. They did a lot for us in terms of assisting with our wedding and went further than requested in seeing that our wedding was as beautiful and romantic as dreamed. Thank you. It also helped that the level of English was good, so communication was not a problem. Heritance can handle all element s of arranging a wedding so there was no need for a wedding planner. They even have celebrety cheif, so meals were of high standard. . Prior to coming to Heritance we were originally in Hikaduwa, which was not that great. We are not surfer, lonely planet travellers, which I felt Hikaduwa was catering for. We are in our mid thirties with our priorities at (quiet, cleanliness, beauty and a level of comfort a lady expects at this age). The prices in Hikaduwa for Hotels was not in proportion to what you were getting. Heritance was more expensive but you got what you paid for and the website is not misleading in terms of quality of rooms and the look of the hotel. We found a number of hotels in Hikaduwa misleading on their websites. Therefore Heritance was our saviour! We also recommend Heritance for a family holiday. As a kid I would of had blast swimming in the sea and swimming in both pools, one of which has a beautiful tree covering it. Lots of activities in the hotel and surrounding area. We have been to Sri Lanka three times and if I was to go back, I would only go back to Heritance to the calm and beauty of the place. Use Heritence web site to book. You get the best prices there. Dont be afraid to negociate an upgrade once you get there. You might be surprised.",positive
Food was terrific. Staff were so helpful. Rooms were perfect. Activities in the pool were fun. Beach was amazing. Lion beer was good. The sports bar was nice and it had air con. The best holiday I have been on so far,positive
"My first visit to this Hotel ( Hotel Triton) was back in 1985 and I made 4 subsequent visits until 1995, so this was my first for 16 years, and I was very much looking forward to arriving. The Wow factor has not been lost, the arrival and almost every corner of this fine hotel still does not disappoint. Forget the ridiculous Hotel star rating scheme that means nothing other than providing a tick list of facilities, this Hotel is Very good and has just the right atmosphere, making you very comfortable all day every day. The beach area is as always stunning and the Beach bar/Restaurant, along the beach a welcome lunch time stroll away. Food is good, although I did find some difficulty in making choices due to limited menu in the coffee shop. Of course everyone can find fault if they wish to, I found very little, except every day dirty table clothes at breakfast, now is this fault of the staff for not replacing them between every guests arrival for breakfast? or the eating habits of other guests, I regret to say that the eating habits of many guests are not what they should be, I witnessed Gluttony on a grand scale at the breakfast buffet, which is Im afraid a measure of the social sophistication of most of the guests more than the ability of the staff. I am sure full board packages does provide Heritance with valuable business in these difficult times, but a great number of guests are "" Of a Type"" and care should be exercised by the management if they wish to avoid the worst of low grade tourism that is so prolific in many European destinations. There was also an attempt to charge me for items I had not consumed, from the mini bar. I expected this, as on arrival there were a number of mini bar consumption forms in my room that had been partially completed. Not unexpected that they attempted to charge me for items that matched the forms that were in my room on arrival. A very firm refusal by me to pay unless they could demonstrate an audit and my consumption soon dealt with the situation. Thank you Heritance for a lovely stay, hopefully my next will not be after a gap of 16 years.",positive
"My son and now daughter in law arranged their wedding at the Heritance Ahungalla, what a brilliant day. The staff at the hotel could not have made it better or more special for them. Photos on Facebook confirm all being said. The rest of our extended family were in attendance and staying at the Heritance Ahungalla, I could not fault this hotel at all. Staff were very nice, food was brilliant, accommodation was excellent. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel whether it be for a holiday or a wedding venue. Keep up the good work Heritance Ahungalla. Thanks to you all for such a brilliant stay.",positive
"I have visited alot of the more expensive hotels south of Colombo. Bentota Beach, Taj Exotica, Kani Lanka to name a few. All of them have a similar drawback, the food. This is where Heritance stands out from the crowd. We went Half Board and both the Breakfasts and Dinners were excellent quality, with alot of variation for fussy eaters (like me!). In addition to this, the hotel is right on the beach, which is nice a clean and the two pools are beautiful. The hotel has free internet, a nice pub and nice staff. The only criticism I have of the hotel is that the room we had was a little dated and did not have a bathtub. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who fancied a break from the busy life of Colombo",positive
"Ahungalle Heritance is probably the best beach hotel in Sri Lanka. We had our daughters wedding at this hotel on February 26, 2011. We came from Australia to have the wedding in this hotel. My daughter wanted a beach wedding in Sri Lanka. We selected this hotel for the wedding after very careful evaluation. We knew that all hotels belonging to Heritance group are good. But we had many other reasons to select it. It was designed by Geoffrey Bava. It is near the beach and the beach is unpolluted and well maintained, comparatively free of outside visitors. The hotel is renowned for its good food and superior service. Their pastry chef who was to make the wedding cake is an international award winner. We stayed in the hotel for a few days while arranging the wedding. We got the hotel to plan the whole wedding and they arranged everything The hotel arranged Kandyan dancers to lead the couple to the podium, then some girls to sing Jayamangala gatha and another person to perform the wedding rites and sing Ashtaka,. Food was served on the beach A platform has been placed to dance and there was a band providing music. The complete package included a cake, champaine fountain and fireworks. The highlight was the bullock cart which took the bride and groom on a short going away trip. I would give full marks for their excellent arrangements and management of the whole function. The hotel is very flexible and you can get them to do whatever activities you want them to do and give the other activities to outsiders. We got a photographer and a videographer from outside, but if you want to, you can get the hotel to arrange them for you. We had about 85 guests for the wedding, but I understand the hotel undertakes weddings for very small groups or just the couple without any visitors. More than anything, I value the service. The hotel staff are very courteous and obliging. They will go to any length to make their guests happy and satisfied. In summary, the hotel gave my daughter a wedding function to remember and cherish for the rest of her life. - Andrew Fernando",positive
"Ahungalla is located 90KM south of Colombo. Unfortunately there is not another way to get there other than by bus/car. Depending on the time of the day, that journey can take a good 4 hours as there are no highways in Sri Lanka. Sit back, relax and enjoy the trip as I'm sure you will love the place you'll be heading to. This hotel is a little piece of paradise. My partner and I stayed there for a week (March 9 thru 17th, 2011) and we were very pleased with this hotel. It's supposed to be a 5-star, but I believe it is a 4-star for European standards. The room was pretty large and well-decorated. The food was excellent - the breakfast offered a variety of local fruits and breads. Your typical buffet. There were three ""chefs"" preparing delicious omelets, egg fritters, waffles and some other goodies just for you. The coffee was always fresh and served to your table. We were on a HB scheme, so we had dinners at the hotel as well. Lots of seafood (the shrimps were absolutely delicious!), local dishes (careful with the curry! might be a tad spicy!), different types of rice, salads, the best beef ever! Drinks not included. The central AC in the room worked perfectly. The best I've ever had!!! There's a thermostat so you can control the temperature very easily. They don't turn the AC off during the day when you're not in your room or in the middle of the night like many hotels in Europe! That is a big plus - the humidity is really high so you'll be happy with that AC! And the AC is still running when your key is not in the little card thingy by the door. If you want to eat at the hotel during the day, the prices are comparable to those in Europe ($10 to $15 can get you a decent meal). But if you want to eat good and cheap food prepared by locals, make sure to visit the Sunshine Restaurant, located at the end of the beach, on the right-hand side of the hotel facing the beach. Lovely people, great prices (beer half the price!), a decent menu for such a small place. Plus you get to chat with locals! (English is widely spoken in Sri Lanka, not always understood though!) The hotel has 2 pools - you'll see the 1st pool just past the lobby area. As you arrive, you will see this huge open space, with beautiful marble floors, and the pool, and the beach. What a great view! The 2nd pool is on the right hand side of the property. Towels and cushions are provided by the hotel staff. The cushions are a bit worn out but the towels are clean. You will be kindly reminded to tip the pool boys. From the pool, you will see a lot of people trying to sell you something on the beach. They will call you, ask for a cigarette (if you're a smoker), but they can't get too close to the pool as the hotels provides security guards to block them from entering the property. You talk to them if you wish to. One of the people we talked to was a man called ""Pree"". He (and many other guys) will offer you trips. My partner and I, after having read the recommendations on other websites that those people were actually reliable, decided to accept Mr. Pree's offer to go to Galle and to Kandy. His English is not that bad but he's a hard bargain! Together with some other people who work at the Sunshine Rest. he will bring you to the most common tourist places around Sri Lanka. They own vans and have experienced drivers working for them. Mr. Pree was very knowledgeable and we were very pleased with his work. Make sure to ask for Mr. Pree at the Sunshine Restaurant. You won't regret. The more people in your group, the cheaper it is. Close the final price including the tip before you agree on anything. Tipping seems to be a common practice in Sri Lanka, and even at a hotel like this one, the employees will expect a $1 (100 rupees) tip for most services provided. You can use dollar bills if you like - they don't mind it. I was told by a local man that the average salary in Sri Lanka is between $100 to $150 a month, so it is understandable the tipping practice. I will leave that up to you - use your common sense. I felt like I didn't have to tip them every day for cleaning my room and making my bed. They will come back around 6pm offering fresh towels, and will probably expect a tip if you get the towels. Again, it is up to you. I didn't always need those towels, so I didn't tip those 2 employees every day either. The check-in process was very different from any other hotels I've been to before. I flew from Poland with a group of Polish tourists (even though I'm not Polish, I live in Poland so we used a Polish travel agency). Upon our (late) arrival (around 2am), we were kindly asked by the hotel staff to wait at the restaurant area, where we were served tea/coffee. They brought us the check-in forms and got our passports to double check the information. Once everything was filled out, we were given room numbers and our luggage brought to the room. Easy breezy. Free wi-fi all over the hotel. Ask the receptionist for a wi-fi code. They'll give you a piece of paper with the login information - and the best, FREE OF CHARGE! There didn't seem to be a disco or anything of the likes in this hotel - so if you're looking for a peaceful place -- THIS is the place!!",positive
"Spent 7 nights at the hotel at the beginning of February. Enjoyed: the food, the pools (particularly the one with the leaning tree), the sound of the ocean waves crushing on the shore, the spa, the beautiful sunsets from the room balcony and generally the great feeling of being in Sri Lanka in a beautiful hotel. Did not enjoy: the monitor lizards walking around, (did not know they would be there and just got terrified when I saw the first one strolling around the beach!!!), the overwhelming strenght of the ocean waves which prevents you from swimming, the beach ladies constantly calling you in order to sell you something.",negative
"We had a beautiful and relaxing week. Our family consists of me, my husband and our little girl who is one year old and we needed a place where we could enjoy the sun, the nature, relax, and let the girl play. The room was perfectly situated just by the huge swimming pool so that we could swim and play in the garden the whole day (unfortunately the ocean in Sri Lanka is too wild to swim in it). While our daughter was taking her afternoon nap, my husband and I could lay in the sun as we were just in front of the room. Because villages in Sri Lanka cannot offer too much in terms of recreation, you can get everything you need in the hotel (nice restaurants, nice bars, evening shows). Mr Kekke from the hotel management needs a particular mention as he is taking very good care of customers, making sure that they all have an enjoyable time (sometimes he was even babysitting for us to let us have dinner quitely). I would definetly recommend the hotel to anyone who wants to stay in this area of Sri Lanka.",positive
"We stayed here for 3 nights at the end of our tour. The hotel is right on the beachfront, at the end of its private drive, and the bay is beautiful. There are two large swimming pools, one with an old tree overhanging so you can swim in the shade, Friendly and helpful staff (if a bit slow and inefficient). Food is buffet style, and was really excellent, with lots of choice, particularly for desserts, including the likes of sticky toffee pudding. Our room was spacious and modern with a balcony with room for table and chairs. Beachboys and ladies were annoying, even calling out to you when you were lying on the sunbeds, though once you'd run the gauntlet, you can walk on the beautiful beach for a while. Grounds weren't as extensive as I'd hoped from this class of hotel. Only a few yards between hotel and beach front. There is a fair bit of wildlife, monitor lizards, monkeys (not aggressive) and bee-eaters. On our last night at sunset, a nest of turtles hatched out which was a beautiful end to our holiday. Every afternoon, about 40 villagers dragged a large fishing net through the surf, and sold their catch on the beach.",positive
The hotel is truly beautiful. As soon as you drive in and stop at the portico the view through the lobby to the pool and the sea beyond is ure to leave you spell bound. Its a very charming place with a lovely beach front. The rooms are well appointed with great views. The staff is good but the service is too laid back and could be better. Overall an enjoyable experience with good food at the restaurants.,positive
"Lovely hotel and pool area. Room spacious and comfortable. Didn't like the check out procedure where we were taken into a back room with no windows and given receipts for every single thing we had signed for during our 10 days. Food ok, a bit repetitive after 10 days. Overall, a great holiday though.",positive
"I stayed in the hotel for 10 nights with my family in month of early February 2011. It was a wonderful stay in Sri Lanka. I did a tour to whale wathching too. Food was excellent , you will be able to experience the all kind of fresh seafood inside the hotel. Beach is excellent... It is a public beach... You will be able to visit some Sea food restaurants in the Beach but those are hopeless... we went once to the restaurant called Sun Shine... two of our family got badly effected with diaria... Hotel Doctor helped us very much, unfortunatly we had to spend two good days of our holiday in the room .. It was the only dissapointment I had in the my Holiday...... Pool bar Staff , Front office Staff, Housekeeping were very helpfull. I always recemmend to have your meals inside the hotel and you will be able get better quality food and service in the hotel........... We will be back soon.....",positive
If you're planning a trip down south I would highly recommend a few nights at this amazing hotel. You will be completely blown away by the design. We stayed in an ocean view room. It's a little pricey but worth every penny. The staff are extremely professional and customer focused. The rooms are generous in size and very clean. The infinity pool is incredible.The cuisine served at each restaurant is of a very high standard. There is a generous spread of both eastern and western cuisine. The Spa treatments are wonderful. I will definitely stay here on future visits to Sri Lanka.,positive
"We were so lucky to have a wonderful room in an excellent position. The views were fabulous. The sea was quite rough, but my husband managed to swim for a little while before the waves knocked him down. Beach fabulous and the swimming pool was the best we have ever experienced. Staff were very attentive and helpful. Nihal in the restaurant looked after us really well. He produced a filet steak for my husband who said it was the best he had ever had. My only adverse comment on this hotel is that the staff all expected a tip even for the smallest of job.",positive
"We were two couples who went to this place to celebrate our first wedding anniversary.. This is a huge property with almost all the facilities.. Their service is really nice, they gave us some 4-5 hours early check-in without any problems.. It also has live-band which plays music and sing songs with a decent discotheque as well.. A little expensive on the food though for which we discovered this small restaurant called ""Sunshine Restaurant' located near the beach (2 mins walk), it offers great, delicious authentic srilankan food at very decent prices.. we particularly liked the fact that they would always give some snacks complimentary for drinks like potato chips etc., impressed by their food we also asked them to arrange us for a dinner on the beach and they did it fantastically without any extra charge and made our trip memorable..",positive
"Our stay here cost about £180 per night for a double room. Overall the hotel is nice but just not really living up to the standards you'd expect of a 4 star hotel or the price tag. For example the toilets in the reception area were rather dark and needed a clean and tidy, there were lots of staff around but so many of them doing nothing and at one time I had to ask 5 different staff to order drinks over a period of about 20 mins before anything actually happened, a lot of the time the waiting staff seemed to just cluster in groups and were lost if actually asked to do anything. The cushions on the sun loungers were ancient, one of the things we noticed that should be easy to put right if the hotel put some of its profits back into the premises. The hotel makes a lot of its 'award winning' chefs which became a bit irritating after a couple of days as some food was great, some really not so good and I had the only stomach upset of the entire trip after eating at the hotel as did a couple of the family, I think due to food being reheated as some things looked rather familiar. Also they seemed thrown at breakfast if more than one or two people wanted the freshly cooked items such as hoppers so you had to wait absolutely ages or give up and have items that were not needing cooking - a real shame as I love my Dosa and hoppers! The kids club was good but the evening entertainment seemed to be the male ents team dressing in drag every night and miming to something and they seemed to abandon the kids pretty quickly if there was any sign of mingling with the grown ups. The other big downer for the hotel is the mosquitoes which are absolutely rife, not totally avoidable but I feel they could have made more of an effort with the rooms and common areas to minimise the mozzy numbers - as most of the other hotels we stayed in had done. Plus points were the two nice pools and the nice view of the sea. Without a fantastic rate to entice me back I'd be inclined to try somewhere else along the coast when I next go back.",neutral
"I write this review purely to warn people to respect the surf. I have recently returned from this hotel where immediately in front of the hotel I body surfed a moderate size wave of hidden force which threw me head first into the ocean bottom. I escaped breaking my neck, but did not escape a head injury which left me with two black eyes. I am an experienced body surfer and I write this to warn people. There IS a danger flag in front of this hotel I just apparently chose to ignore it. Please don't be as stupid as I was.",negative

"Planned to trip to Srilanka for my wedding anniversary with my entire family. After landing at the airport and a pleasant drive to ahungalla we reached this magnificent property that sprawls out from the entrance and the fabulous use of water spaces. The property with its alluring pool, fabulous beach and amazing large rooms is magical. With excellent food, great all day activities, 2 superb pools, a stunning beach front and pleasing service this is one stay that will linger in memory for a long time.",positive
"We had a wonderful holiday with our 10 month old baby here in November 2010. We stayed for 5 nights and came away so relaxed. The Resort has a fabulous setting right on the beach and is a fabulous design. The rooms are well appointed, with a very comfortable bed and the baby cot was a traditional wooden cot with high bars. Our baby slept very well. The bathrooms are lovely but a suggestion to the hotel to use different containers for the refillable products (as the shampoo etc was impossible to get out!). There are two excellent pools with loads of wildlife wandering around the poolside. The food was of good quality, and we had some nice meals. Not a lot of choice at lunch in the cafes. However in the main buffet restaurant, the breakfast was always lovely and there are different theme meals every night. The chef at the restaurant even made special meals for our fussy baby - fresh puree pumpkin etc at no charge. So kind of the Resort! The Coco Spa was also great, and I had a lovely body scrub and massage. My husband had a massage on another occasion and he loved that too. The staff were on the whole fantastic and couldn't do enough for you, but sometimes the cleaners of the rooms were a bit hit and miss (probably dependent on how much you tipped!). These minor criticisms aside, we would really reccomend this hotel.",positive
"76km down south from colombo city. Approx 3 hours of travel. Located 500meters inside from the main Galle Road. Entrance is magnificient, pass through big palm trees and the last turn brings the WOW factor, as you will see the pond, marbled lobby floor, swimming pool and the ocean in one level in the horizon. MAGINIFIQUE!. The welcome was warm and casual. Good way to start a holiday. Ideal place for relaxation and quite holiday. Beach is less populated as its the only hotel standing there. Food is nothing exclusive, usual 5 star food and service from the staff. One bar and the lounge. Reasonably priced menu. Activities are very much limited within the hotel. Nice place to pick your favourite author's latest production and enjoy the holiday. Beach is rough during the time we visited. Always check with the life guard before dipping in to the sea. There are 2 swimming pools to compensate the bad sea conditions for a nice swim.",positive
"Nice hotel but let down by a couple of things. Some of the staff are lovely but.... My daughter's favourite Jack Wills t-shirt went missing - one she wore to sleep in, so she never took it out of the room. The hotel staff are very hungry for tips (one waiter told me within a minute of meeting that he was the sole breadwinner for his family and he only earned 4,000 rupees a month). It gets oppressive. The cleaners come into your room (both sets, am and pm) and tell you they are the only person responsible for cleaning your room (and can I have a tip please! ). We were given only one mug, and there were a lot of mosquitos in the room. The toiletries are in refillable china containers and its impossible to get anything out of them. Food is very good but lunches and drinks very expensive. Gave us a lovely christmas eve meal and went to great efforts (ice sculptures and father christmas arriving in a boat.) Waited for ever for coffee in the morning. Not much to do when it rains and the water was too rough to go in the sea, plus you get hassled and followed on the beach. Could be so much better.",neutral

"This is a beach resort of excellent quality. The rooms are neatly done and comfortable. The pool is inviting. The beach has good sand and the hotel provides beach dinners. The spa is also good and offers fairly good value. The restaurant is also nice. The staff is polite overall , but lacks in service - because of the size of the property and their lack of English knowledge",positive
"A week into this hotel passed by very fast and to make a story short I will give my opinion in points: RESTAURANT 10/10 (absolutely genius, variety of food and all was perfect) STAFF 9/10 (always helpful, smiling, nice, one point less for hard ""tip-looking"" behaviour) POLLS 10/10 (clean and nice, up to 3 meters deep) BEACH 8/10 (clean, beatiful sand , ""beachbboys"" make it dirty sometimes but it's cleaned regurarly) ROOMS 5/10 - 8/10 first we were in ground floor room (small, dark and dungeons feeling), after complains we were moved to nice, light, first floor room with ocean view), some of our friend found grund floor better as terrace goes just next to the swimmig pool CATEGORY - for me it should be **** star hotel (because ot the bathrooms and room size) BEACHBOYS - they're standing all day log an the beach and try to sell you something, it's annoying if you want to lay down on the sand. They're not allowed to go into hotel area so it's easy to find quiet place near the pool. TRIPS: On the beach you may find Mr. Anil who helped us to organise short trip around and we were glad of his help - all was perfect! On the right of the beach (300m north) you will find nice seafood restaurat (we may recomend it) and Mr. Tino, owner of this place also organise trips. Our friend were happy of the trip but were overcharged so pls double check if you want to go with him somewhere. If you look for romantic, quiet spot it will be ideal. Me and my wife we are were glad to be there! WE HAD PERFECT TIME IN HERITANCE AHUNGALLA ;) Ps. I will not recomend this hotel for couples with children and night-life seekers!",positive
"Me and my partner stayed here in Sept 2010 on a half board basis. When booking the holiday in the May we were not told that Sept was Monsoon season! However during our 16 day stay we had rain for 3 - 4 days on and off. The rain lastest for maybe an hour or so and then everyone was back out by the pool, most people jumped in the pool whilst it was raining instead of going inside. Hotel is rated as 5 star, unfortunately this is not the rating i would give. It is more like 4 star, the curtains in the room were a little dirty, i think this was where they were getting caught in the balcony doors when closing them. There was dust on top of the lamp shades and in the corners of the room but nothing major. Beds and bathroom was spotless though. The hotel has alot of wildlife wandering around which i absolutely loved. Monatar lizards, chipmonks, newts, monkeys - it was brilliant. Food was lovely, loads to choose from every morning and evening. Service was like nothing i have ever experienced before, the waiters were so kind and couldn't do enough for you. When we left we were given gifts from a few of the waiters that served us in the evening. Would I stay again - definitely, during peak season not monsoon. Would i recommend the hotel - yes to couples who want to do nothing more than relax and take it easy, its certainly not for families with children or those who are adventurous and want to do something different every day. Value for money - 2 adults, 16 day stay on half board basis, flights and hotel £2300.",positive
"We got married at the Heritance Hotel 3 weeks ago and I must say that it was a “DREAM WEDDING”. We had close to 100 guests attending from all over the world, many of whom were in Sri Lanka for the first time. We were also hosting 4 functions (3 dinners and a lunch), all to be coordinated by the hotel whom we had been interacting with mainly through email and phone calls (aside from a couple of visits to the hotel during the initial stages of planning). We were a bit concerned about how things would pan out over the three days of festivities and I have to say that we could not have been happier!!! During the evenings of our celebrations, it was expected to rain and the hotel did a great job to meet with us to discuss alternate locations for the functions in the event of rain. Even the alternate locations were all different places as we wanted to make sure we had different venues to create a different vibe for each of our functions. The chefs of the hotel held separate meetings with us to ensure that the menus were what we wanted. They delivered to all our needs, including creating figurines for our wedding cake that were wearing the same outfits my husband and I had on for the wedding!!! Additionally, a friend of ours had specific dietary needs and the staff at the functions made it a point to find it and give him his specially created meals. Our Friday evening function was to be held on an island outside the hotel but due to the threat of rain, we cancelled that and decided to reschedule it for the next day at lunchtime- quite a last minute decision! The hotel took charge of all the logistics and we had an incredible lunch the next day at the Island catered to by the hotel. We even wanted to rent a boat that was already on the lake to serve our guests drinks while they were taking a boat ride, and even on that the hotel delivered!!!!! On the day of our main event, it started to rain during our outdoor sit-down dinner. In less than 5 minutes (and I am NOT exaggerating), the hotel had moved us into the alternate location and we were back into the swing of our celebrations!! Sampath (the Assistant Manager at the hotel), the Chefs, the F&B team, Kay Kay and the rest of the staff bent over backwards to accommodate us at every instant, even when we had less formal dinners and meals before and after the wedding celebrations. In addition to this, the hotel rooms were very nice and the hotel accommodated all our requests in terms of room and needs. The ambiance itself of the hotel is great- the hotel is the perfect size: small enough where we could run into and mingle with our guests during the day and also large enough where our guests could have their own space and time. So in the end, we managed to have cocktails on the beach at sunset, dinner in the lawns, dancing in the nightclub, wedding ceremony on the beach, sit down dinner on another set of lawns, a welcome dinner in the open air at yet another location in the hotel and a great boat ride followed by an incredible lunch on an Island. It is a wonderful place to host a wedding and the hotel made sure that we got everything we wanted and made our wedding even more perfect!",positive
"Checked into hotel Mid August into a luxury room and I would highly reccomend paying that little bit extra as the rooms are huge! And you get a bath tub that overlooks the pool.. but no one can see in as there is mesh stopping.. so its very private! On arrival sat down with a welcome drink (Pineapple or Wood Apple juice) as we came early from Colombo around 11am and room was not ready.. but that did not bother me as they advised full occupancy in hotel before we came and cannot get early check in which was ok because My partner and I sat in the bar and had a few drinks.. they came to us and gave the key instead of us going to reception.... Went to our room! and I thought it was very very clean.. the bed was so comfy... In the luxury rooms there is no ceiling fan tho, but you have an aircon which gets cool in the nights ... Room was cleaned every morning and evening.. fresh towels and bathrobes... Both pools were good but i prefered the private pool the best! & it had a spa you can use from certain hours and relaxing!! I used the Coco Spa and got a sweedish massage and it was the most relaxing thing, and was very professional as they drape you properly with the towels and do an amazing job.. they are Balinese ladies and very lovely and do a great job! My husband got one the following day! Food in the resturant was beautiful... you can get your Sri Lankan curries or you can get Bbq night.. prawns.. lots of salad to choose from... & soups.. my favourite was the deserts.. so lovely ... Staff and chefs were nice! overall i would stay here again.. beach is too rough to swim though which is dissappointing.. as im from Australia .. i love the beaches.. I reccomend seing Hikkaduwa and the huge turtles you can swim with.. Great experience you dont even feel like your in the hustle and bustle of Sri Lanka.",neutral
"My wife and I had two great weeks here, we found all the staff delightfully friendly and polite. special mention to Kithriri,Paleitha and Sunil the pool attendants and K K who is so helpful and friendly. Both the pools are fabulous, the food was good and plentifull. Two must visit places are the Turtle Hatchery which is very close to the hotel and the Elephant Orphenage even though it is a 3 and 1/2 hour drive by car. Dont drive yourself unless you are very brave.There is also a mix of wild life around the hotel like Chipmonks, Iguanas and monkeys, the chipmonks will come and eat from your hand. It was our first visit to Sri Lanka and we would visit again the people are wonderful.",positive
"We planned a weekend outing to the Heritance Ahungalle with the expectation of spending a weekend doing nothing but relaxing all day long. The Heritance didn't fail to deliver and in fact exceed our expectations. The striking points was the absolutely awesome food and very friendly and helpful nature of the staff. Despite the fact that all 150 rooms of the hotel were occupied, the staff still found the time to have a friendly chat with us and make us feel at home. My wife and I had a very relaxing holiday and my 1.5 year old daughter truly had the time of her life. In fact she enjoyed it so much that she got into a very playful mood and kept us up half the night. In a nutshell our experience was as follows, Pluses - Super food - Very friendly staff - Spacious and clean room - Two pools Minuses - Renovations were underway at the hotel and we couldn't use the room balcony - Spa was overpriced Overall it was a super holiday and a big thank you to the Heritance staff who made our stay so special.",positive
"This is a big beachfront property a little south of Bentota. Though the hotel is visibly aged, the rooms are maintained pretty well and are very comfortable. Most rooms have nice view of the sea. The swimming pool is large and is very well maintained. The beach is quite good and is clean but is not ok for swimming.",positive
"We stayed here for a few nights in August 2010 as part of a one month trip. I was very excited about staying here as it was designed by one of my favourite architects, Geoffrey Bawa. However, it was a little bit of a let down on a whole. On arrival the hotel is lovely. You drive through some large gates and up to the open reception area where you immediately notice the infinity pool which looks great. All the staff are very smiley but unfortunately the front desk staff don't really know what they are doing. There was a lot of commotion and we did not get checked in for an hour. Some of our friends did not get checked in for 2 hours. Not what you want after a long journey! First impressions of our room were ok. They are clean but nothing special. We were promised a spectular suite as we were there for a special occassion but we were just given a standard deluxe room which was disappointing. We eventually got our suite on our last night but the only difference was a bit more space and a bath so not really worth the extra money in my opinion. We spent a lot time around the infinity pool which is very clean and the pool boys are great. They provide water aerobics every morning and organise water volleyball straight after so it's a bit lively around that pool up unti lunchtime. There is another pool but we didn't use it. If you like your exercise there is also a small gym which is ok. It's small and basic but has the essentials. You can also go for a run along the beach but as with almost every beach in Sri Lanka be prepared to get hassled by the beach boys/women. One guy came for a run with me whilst trying to sell a tour which I thought was very amusing. Unfortunately I could not give him any business! The food here is great. There is a huge variety on offer and you won't be disappointed. However, if you order snack food be prepared to wait or for the staff to get your order wrong. This seemed to be the norm from our experience and speaking to other guests. The same goes for ordering drinks. They are super slow. You can quite often see your cold drink getting warm on the bar whilst the waiters have a chat. People were constantly chasing up the waiters or walking up to collect their own drinks. The staff, with a few exceptions, seemed to be the main problem at this hotel. They are all very friendly but even the simple things seemed to be an effort. Luckily we have a lot of patience so we found it funny but it was obvious some couples and groups there were getting very frustrated. We stayed at several other hotels in Sri Lanka and the staff were a lot more on the ball. Even when we checked out it became chaos. Lot's of confusion, incorrect bills and in one case it took nearly 1.5 hours! It was a group of 6 but still, not acceptable. We took 30mins and there was only 2 of us. To sum up, this hotel is nice. It has character but it is certainly not 5 star. The rooms and staff could be so much better. My plus points would be the infinty pool and the food. Everthing else could do with improvements. I would recommend this hotel but on the basis don't go there expecting the ultimate paradise. It's good but there is better in Sri Lanka. It's pretty good value for money but needs some attention. 7.5/10 overall.",neutral
"Loved this hotel, great for couples. Gives you everything you expect from a 5 star hotel. nothing too fancy but very relaxing with very nice staff. ""beach boys"" as locals call them are a bit annoying when you leave the hotel boundaries which are marked with flags. those were the only thing to annoy, but as long as you keep yourself inside the hotel boundaries and enjoy watching the ocean not swimming you are fine.",positive
"We had a lovely 2 week stay at the Heritance. As a number of people have previously stated this not a 5 star hotel, but for the price we paid this was excellent value and met our expectations. The hotel is a little remote however you can get tuk-tuk to Bentota so we didn't feel too isolated. The main downside was wear and tear to the soft furnishings - rug and net curtains very stained and holes in curtains which had been repaired. The cleaner was very good though and thoroughly cleaned our room and bought extra towels when requested. I was also disappointed that the gym was out of order during my trip, it also looked very basic indeed. The breakfast was amazing - the fresh omelettes and the Dhosia/Thosias (pancake filled with potato masala and lentil curry) was particularly good and chef has even give us the recipe. The main restaurant was OK, but we did get a little bored with the buffet style every evening as well as the fact that the ambiance was lacking, however the Chinese evening and BBQ evening are probably worth a try. Didn't really understand the ""animators"" - especially with the water aerobics with music blearing out! Luckily this was in the main pool and we tended to sit by the Green pool so didn't really bother us. A little maintenance was taking place during our stay. We stayed on a B&B basis so ate out in Bentota most nights. Bentota is 20 mins in a tuk-tuk and costs 500 rupees return journey - that's £3!! The best restaurant was Diya Sisila (30 min drive / 700 rupees return by tuk-tuk), beautiful place by a lake over looking Bawa's house. You will need to pre-book and take your own alcohol. We also took a trip to Bawa house and gardens and the owner of Diya then collected us from the house and took us across the lake on his catamaran to the restaurant. Saman Villas is a luxury boutique hotel with an amazing restaurant - just watch the cost of the alcohol which was extortionate! Golden Grill has had loads of good reviews but we found this only to be average. The beach shack near the Hotel was wonderful - brilliant selection of fish and prawns! (Called the Sunshine Restaurant). River Safari was lovely morning out - lots of Kingfishers, Cormerants and Kites. Stopped of a the Cinnamon island. Took a trip to Hikkaduwa - very disappointed. Beach not special & moored boats all in the water which prevented you from swimming. If you are looking for a lovely beach try Unawatuna near Galle which we visited on a previous trip to Sri Lanka. Had a Ayurvedic massage at Happy Lanka - 10 min walk from hotel. Head massage was fantastic, although my husband had full body which he found rather rough indeed, much rougher than previous Ayurvdic centres we have visited, but was a good experience. Spa at the Hotel was very good but perhaps a little pricey. The best exchange rate we found was drawing cash out of the ATM. We have a Nationwide bank account for travelling abroad which means no withdrawal fees. At the time of our visit we got 175 rupees from the ATM where as the Hotel's rate was 160. The Hawkers can be a pain - I wish there was a way the Hotel could let them have a stall or something so you can look at there products/services without feeling the constant pressure. We were befriended by a chap called Pradeep who then organised our tuk-tuks and River Trip. Be careful of buying leather bags/goods at the hotel when the bag seller sets up his stall. My wife & I both bought brown leather bags at a good price but the colour on the leather transfers onto your clothing and stains it. It also stains items put inside the bag. I mentioned this to the seller on the day who said to put the bag in sunlight and it will solve the problem. This is not the case. I have made the Heritance aware of this but so far have not had a reply to my e mail.",positive
"The hotel was a very big disapointment. we arrived late in evening, the guy at the reseption looked as he didnt feel like showing us arround, tired, bored (?). On the way to the room, he said that we had been upgrated from the room that we had reserved, we got to the room and the first thing I look at is the bathroom, there was a funny smell, when i told the guy he said that is nothing, we just spraid cinamon before you arrived. the towels were old and far from being smooth and nice. At 7 oclock we were woken up by restaurations done at the hotel; we were not told this was going on. All this is not a five star hotel!!! finally we were moved to a suite but still the higine was not perfet and towells not soft.",negative
"Gthuthi estuti (Thank-you) to the staff of the Heritance Anhugalla. What can we say We had a fantastic time. Thank-you to all the staff, including Thilina who looked after our room, which we thought was out of this world. Thank-you for the lovely fruit boats and the flower displays. The bed linen and towels were changed every day and there was always a lovely smell of Cinamon in the room. Our room was at the residents pool beside a lovely hot tub and the pool attendants always brought us sun loungers and two fresh towels each. The life guards and the animators were very helpful and we enjoyed many good games of volleyball and waterpolo and also a game of snooker. Going to breakfast in the mornings we could hear lovely music from a man playing a flute in thelovely boat in the other fabulous infinity pool beside reception. There were six fabulous places (including room servce) to eat. Nihal looked after us every breakfast and at some of the evening buffets, we must compliment the chefs on the fabulous displays of food. Great choice of food, fresh omlettes in the morning amongst other things including egg hoppers (delicious). Cafe Mustarde restaurant was wonderful managed by Dayal and his very efficent Staff (sorry Anya lost the piece of paper that your names were on) Indika, H.C.Kumara, Lucky, Lakmal and Dayal combined to provide my wife with a fantastic brithday surprise dinner in the exclusive upper room restaurant. Beautiful beach and touts not too bad as others have said they are very poor and they were delighted when we bought a sarong and a hat. We also had a great day at the Turtle hatchery and the river Safari (Cinamon Island is worth a visit). Last but not least is the extremely helpful reception staff including DILSHAN and every body else. To all at Heritance Anhungalla, thank-you for all the lovely memories. Gthuthi estuti (Thank-you) and Gihin Ennam (Goodbye).",positive
Heritance was a treat . we went there as part of our companies annual conference for three days and had a blast . the hotel rooms were spacious and had a great view of the beach . the pool in the hotel was majestic and there are many games facilities around the hotel like beach volleyball etc to keep you occupied in our free time . All the facilities undertaken by the hotel right from organizing the conference to evening dinners and lunches was good and professional . The nightclub was also good . the service was also very good ..the only thing lacking was the food ...none of the meals had in the hotel were really top notch ...and i felt that is what could have taken the hotel to another level .,positive
"We had a memorable week at The Heritance Ahungalla during September 2010. The hotel is very open and airey which is ideal for the climate in Sri Lanka. I can't speak too highly of all the staff from the management to the housekeepers. They were all very helpful and friendly. There are 2 swimming pools and 4 restaurants and bars. There is not a great deal to do in the village so we spent every evening in the hotel. We went on an excursion to the Yala National Park which required an overnight stay elsewhere with a 5 hour car journey each way. It was worth it to go on safari and see animals in the wild especially the elephants. There are one or two villages near to Ahungalla which don't have much in the way of tourist attracttions but are worth visiting. This area was badly hit by the tsunami in 2004 and although a lot of rebuilding has taken place, there is still much to be done and we found that the people were very appreciative of the help they had received form other countries and made tourists very welcome.",positive
"I was in Ahungalla for two days and absolutely loved it. The room I stayed was spacious and very clean and was facing the sea. The staff were very attentive and friendly. There are two pools in the hotel. The one infront of the lobby of the hotel is not the best, the one on the right hand corner of the hotel is more hidden and has a hot tub as well. Th sea was pretty rough the time I went there so was not able to really enjoy a sea swim. Just be aware of hawkers and so called beach boys hovering you when you go to the beach,. The hotel had good entertainment, from fun exercise classes in the pool to music in the nights. I must say the food was really good with a mix of Sri Lankan and western cuisine.",positive
"After reading some recent negative reviews of the Heritance, we wondered if we were staying in the same hotel! Our room was spacious, quiet, extremely comfortable and spotlessly clean with a wonderful view of the ocean and the pool from the balcony. All the staff were efficient, attentive and friendly and couldn't do enough to make you feel welcome and looked after. The grounds were attractive, well tended and relaxing and the pools provided a deliciously cooling antidote to the hot sun. Food was fresh and appetising, providing enough variety to suit all tastes morning and evening. We alternated the main restaurant with the 'cafe' and enjoyed both. Also loved the cool design of the hotel and the airy outside-in feeling throughout. The beach boys were a bit of a problem as they did hassle when you just wanted a peaceful stroll along the shore, but they were friendly and unthreatening and obviously just trying to relieve guests/tourists of a few rupees in exchange for their products - happens in most countries! All in all would recommend the hotel to anyone who enjoys a relaxing and pampered holiday in lovely surroundings as part of their trip to this beautiful island. Annaby",positive
"I am never usually that keen to leave hotel reviews as everyone has such different tastes and expectations from their holiday, but I was so impressed with the Heritance and the service myself and my boyfriend received I simply had to share! I also for the life of me cannot understand how anyone could leave a negative review of this place, although from reading these, it seems that these people may have chosen the wrong holiday destinations. Ok so theres no ""entertainment"" in the evening in the form of bingo (thank the Lord!) or whatever it is some people find enjoyable but I am more than happy to sit relaxing with my cocktail, being waited on hand and foot while listening to a traditional Sri Lanka band or the wonderful piano and violin players that are provided every evening in the bar. Our room was spotless, the air con worked a treat and the sheets and towels were changed every day. The room service guys even come back again at about 6pm to re-make your bed and change your towels again! Food wise, we were B & B. Breakfast was lovely, plenty of cakes and pastries, breads, bacon, eggs, cereal etc. You can even have a traditional Sri Lanka curry for breakfast if you wise! Tea and coffee is in plentiful supply and the tea is very nice. We ate our lunch at the pool bar every day and have a selection of casual sandwiches and bar food. The milkshakes are very tasty! Evening wise, you have a choice of the Fine Dining restaurant or the coffee shop (not really a coffee shop, more of a relaxed restaurant and alot cheaper than the Fine Dining). Both are excellent and have a lovely ambiance. The staff at the Heritance are nothing short of wonderful. They are all so friendly and helpful and enjoy a quick chat with you, everybodys English incidentally is extremely good. We felt so safe and well taken care of, far more so than on our past trips to Thailand and other parts of Asia. By the pool during the day the pool attendants are brilliant at getting you towels and chairs and the bar guys will bring you a lovely cold glass of lime juice. The pools are very very clean and the most perfect temperature. We always used the residence only pool around the side as it was quieter and whether you enjoy swimming proper lengths or wallowing around with your book there was always plenty of room for everyone. It can be difficult to brave the beach as you are accosted the second you step foot onto it buy people trying to sell you things and take you on trips, and I admit it did annoy me at first. However, its really important to remember that Sri Lanka is a poor country still feeling the repercussions of the Tsunami and it means the world to these people to buy a couple of scarves and table clothes (which are lovely if you take the time to look) for just a couple of quid. By the time we left we were so relaxed it was hard to stand up straight. I encourage anyone to try this place out. I am very particular about cleanliness and get nervous abroad sometimes about the food hygiene etc but this hotel and the staff made me feel so at ease. A fab holiday. Enjoy!",positive
"Ignored by the bell boys at arrival and left for half an hour in a dingy bar to await our room. Despite a choice of only 3 welcome drinks, the barman managed to get one of the two wrong !! Eventually given a room which was right on the beach, but seemed to be the only room in the hotel without net curtains, so no privacy at all. We then noticed that the door lock was hanging off so called maintenance. While waiting for them, we discovered a jammed cupboard (so no access to safe), a poky, smelly bathroom and a TV with no reception. Eventually went back to reception (after unconvincing lock fix) and demanded a new room which we were given after another hour's wait. It was better, although lighting was poor. Cleaning was haphazard, towels were often taken but not replaced and there were no insect sprays/mats. Each morning one of the pool boys comes and blasts the pool area with rap music to try to encourage aerobics participants - they should listen to the words one day, which are about 50% expletives and not everyone's taste !! Food was OK but nothing like the Kandalama, another Heritance hotel. Spa was very expensive although treatments were good - watch out for $ prices which mysteriously end up being a lot more in rupees (works out about 140 to the $, not 115). Lots of hassle from beach sellers as well. Overall we were very disappointed as we had such a wonderful time at the Heritance Kandalama in Dambulla and expected the same from this sister hotel. For half the price you can stay at the Kani Lanka in Kalutara which has better food and entertainment.",negative
"We just got back yesterday from our trip to Sri Lanka. We absolutely loved our stay at the Heritance, we had a nice room with fantastic views of the ocean and gardens. Our stay was very relaxing, so much that we decided we couldn't be bothered with leaving the hotel and upgraded to half board. The staff were definitely one of the main highlights, they were always ready to help with a smile. Loved the fact that there were 2 pools.The food was always fantastic with a good variety and the waiters very attentive. We were there for 5 nights & it was perfect.",positive
"The Inheritance Hotel at Ahungalla is spectacular: beautifully sited, wonderfully designed, serene, luxurious - a little piece of paradise. We arrived after a fabulous trip across Sri Lanka and found ourselves in lovely rooms overlooking the beach and the gardens, we wandered through the open hallways, enjoyed delicious food and relaxed in the sunshine - on the beach. I thoroughly recommend the Ahungalla: all the staff were attentive, friendly, helpful and efficient. The choice and quality of food in the restaurant was excellent, our rooms were clean, spacious, very well-equipped and the bed was marvellously comfortable. Whilst staying we walked on the beach, visited the turtle sanctuary, took a car into Galle and surfed at Bentota. Anne and Trevor de Silva",positive
"Totally disappointed with this hotel. The entrance foyer was cold and clinical which was about the standard for the whole hotel. There was no entertainment until we complained and then there was some water aerobics and that was about it. There was a games room that was filthy and had about 2 board games in it, the snooker table you had to pay for, the pool table you had to pay for. There were 3 restaurants but you only really had a choice of 2 as the Upper Dining Room was ridiculously expensive, we did not actually see anyone eat there in our 2 week stayy! There was a cafe with a very limited menu or the main restaurant that was a buffet. The food in these 2 restaurants was okay but the service was terrible. Breakfast was served in the buffet restaurant and the tables were always mucky, you had to constantly ask for tea or coffee and sometimes wait for up to 20 minutes for it to arrive. On a Saturday the hotel opens the main infinity pool area up to local customers, this meant that we had to use the other pool which upset the children. The main pool was rammed with people playing games and being extremely loud making it much to dangerous for children to swim and also a very uncomfortable environment. Whilst at the other pool we ordered lunch and were told we would have a long wait as they were so busy as it was a Saturday!! Whilst we were at the hotel the Sri Lankan and Indian national crickets teams were there, the hotels focus was totally on them and important members of staff were moved to run the catering at the matches - this was very much noticed by guests at the hotel as the service in the restaurants became ridiculously slow and many mistakes were made. The people of Sri Lanka our lovely and very kind and helpful and we felt totally safe when we wandered along the beach way from the hotel. We met a fantastic driver who was wonderful in showing us around and really looked after our children, he is a recommended driver at the hotel and his name is Erish. We had some absolutely wonderful experiences when he took us out as he really worked to make sure we saw everything and enjoyed ourselves, he is also a good driver and very safe which is quite a rarity in Sri Lanka!!!",negative
"I stayed in Heritance for 14 days within travelling through Sri Lanka in Aug 2010. I would say the hotel is excellent for non-developed country like Sri Lanka. The rooms are clean, they make the rooms up twice per day, though they forget to leave room accesorries (a comb, sewing set, etc). Sleeping facilities are also wonderful -very soft, they change linen everyday, two big pillows are also in your disposal. What I really appreciated in Heritance is excellent and friendly service and cuisines. I higly recommend you to take HB, you will not regret - the breakfasts and dinners are super! Pool restaurant and bar propose you good cocktails, I highly recommend you cocktails with fresh juices, s.a. Pina Colada. Fish restaurant and Lobby Restaurant are wonderful, the service and waiters there perform excellent service. But the real area for improvement for the mentioned hotel are so called ""Beach Boys"" (and girls)) who appear to be too annoying. Try to avoid speaking with them. They propose you everything - from restaurant in their village till trips. The trips are of course a bit cheaper then provided by official providers though I do NOT recommend u to take them. Which is more, one of the tourists mobile phone was stolen on the beach (presumabely by one of the beach boys). If I were the hotel manager I would not let them seating and annoying the tourists. I would say it is 4 Star good hotel, value for money, the best in this area.",positive
"We have just revisted the Ahungalla after staying there last year. We have stayed in many hotels across Sri Lanka including Kandalama and the Tea Factory, but for a pleaseant friendly holiday or business trip, this hotel really takes some beating. From the moment you arrive a friendly face greets you at reception and provides all of the information you require for your stay. If you are greeted by Arju the front of house Manager, you are in for a real treat as he is meticulous in his service provision. The rooms are of a very high standrad and an upgrade to a superior room is available. But believe me the standard rooms are of a level of any five star hotel across Asia. The food is excelent and the staff can not be more attentive. You are in for a great break if you are looking to stay at this hotel. Feel free to email us for any additional information and If you read this as a member of the Hotel staff team, thanks for making our trip special and we look forward to seeing you next year. Glen and Gill",positive
"We last visited this hotel 17 years ago when it was called the Triton. We returned with our 20 year old daughter and 18 year old son to hopefully have a similar holiday experience. The Heritance did not disappoint. As we drove throught the gates and up the long drive to the hotel it brought back many happy memories. The Hotel Heritance as it is now known retains much of the structure of the Triton , but in many ways is so much better. The staff are fantastic, the food is excellent, the rooms are excellent and its very difficult to find fault with anything. The pools are excellent. There were 2 weddings held at the hotel when we were there and it looked like an excellent location. Much better than other hotels we have stayed at. We had a lovely relaxing holiday in a beautiful place. We will not be waiting 17 years to go back, this hotel is now firmly on our list of favourite places we must return to.",positive
"On entering the private secured ornate gates to the Ahungalla Hotel in Sri Lanka I was overwhelmed by the view which I had arrived at. The beautiful water feature at the front of the hotel with its modern design and an open plan reception. I was greeted by a beautifully dressed Sri Lankan lady who presented me with a flower and showed me to a seat by a spectacular infinity swimming pool and a stunning bar area, I was then given a choice of a complimentary welcome drink and my luggage was taken to my room. On arriving at my room which was beautifully designed with an amazing view of yet another tranquil and beautifully designed pool area and the beach just behind I was more than happy with the accommodation, the bathroom was lovely and a great deal of thought had gone into the lay out and design, however there was no bath. After expressing my slight concern and explaining I was here alone for ten days and had stayed at another two Heritance hotels on this trip I was greeted by the Manager who then showed me to yet another stunning room with equally beautiful views and a bath. The food in the restaurant has been better than I could have ever imagined, with traditional, local, European and oriental and pretty much world wide cuisine. The staff were fabulous and could not do enough to help. The entertainment in the evenings was very tastefully, educational and fun. I would also like to express on my oppinion from a woman travelling alone this hotel was one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at due to its atmosphere, staff, security and the clientel which it attracts. I will be returning in the very near future with my family to come and visit the lovely people who work here which I would now class as my friends.",positive
"Heritance Ahungalla is not by UK standards a 4,5 star hotel but it was a nice hotel. There is a good selection of restaurants from buffet, café style, fine dining to an outdoor grill and all was off fantastic quality. We went for the B&B option and it worked out we spent about £28pp per day for lunch, dinner and a couple of drinks ( even had lobster one night!) The rooms are a good size however we found the linen and towels to often be dirty. Unfortunately we also had a small amount of money stolen by the cleaning staff. The location is perfect if you want a hotel that is more isolated but for us it was a little quite. During the monsoon session the sea was too rough to swim in so you are limited to sitting by and swimming in the pools.",neutral
"We visited Heritance Ahungalla after long flight from UK. It took us 3Hrs to reach the hotel from the air port. Once we arrived in the hotel we had to wait another 2Hrs to get our rooms. 9in the mean time we not not informed that rooms were ready until I requested them the delay. Rooms were dirty in the old block and damp. Standard Sri Lankan food serverd in the main restaurant. But pricing is so high. (USD$50.00 for two people for rice & curry) Pool - was great - clean & large pool of two different pools were great. Checking out was a experience where we had to go to a back office to make the payment. The cashier in the back office has no customer service experience at all. Not even a THANK YOU were said when the final bill was settle down. Around the hotel area their is no any other shops, restuarnt or attractions. I hope the hotel improve standards. Considering the service you get in Asia South Hotels - Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, these hotels give a better value for your $$$ and more great options.",positive
Loved the hotel - rooms very classy with good air conditioning. Green pool was a fantastic area with squirrels and iguanas for entertainment. Food good and nicely varied in the evenings. Staff friendly and helpful. Would return with little hesitation. Do not attract the attention of the Hawkers on the beach though!,positive
"Just returned from two weeks at the Heritance and what an experience!! We were lucky enough to be staying at the hotel alongside the Sri Lankan and Indian cricket teamsand were made to feel part of the whole thing. Everyone was so welcoming and eager for us to join in with the celebrations associated with the national game. The Heritance is an experience that we would not to have missed - we have had an amazing two weeks and experienced luxury and elegance at its best - thankyou. The staff at the Heritance are truly amazing and take the time and trouble to get to know you and chat without always expecting the assoicated tips. A big thank you to Mr Arju and his staff, in particular Laknath who we understand left the day after we did - he will be missed at the hotel we are sure. The room we were upgraded to was again truly amazing, very clean with clean sheets daily and towels twice daily. The pool area was very clean and well maintained, with local widelife in abundance - again thankyou to Dr Filat who made sure our sun beds were ready each morning. Our increased waistlines are an example of how good the food was, ample choices with a wide variety available at each mealtime. Our stay at the Heritance was made even more special by the recommendations of Mr Dave Stockwell who is a regular visitor and we thank you for your input into our two week stay. Whilst on holiday we went on two trips, one a local boat trip and a 2 day trip to Kandy. We were treated to excellent service and an experience we would not have wanted to have missed by a local named Kamal. Kamal made us feel part of his family and welcomed us into his humble life eagerly. We thoroughly enjoyed our two week stay and once again thank you for all at the Heritance and Dave Stockwell. Truely amazing!!!!",positive
"My husband and I, both late twenties, booked this hotel on a two for one fantastic deal through hayes and jarvis. We travelled with my parents, whom are well travelled and have stayed in many 5star plush hotels around the world, and my sister and her 11 year old daughter. For value for money the hotel was fantastic. It was re built after the tsunami and so is relatively knew with most mod cons and was lovely and clean. The food was some of the best we have had, although sometimes funny combinations! All a'la carte except the occassional served themed buffet - and we are talking curry night wth some of the best curry we've had, and bbq night with amazing bbq'd seafood. Only downfall was the wine list of which most they didn't have. Lovely quiet hotel, friendly staff - even gave cooking lessons to one of the guests we met. Lovely beach - don't be put off by the few beach traders as they are really friendly and we were introduced to one of them by another guest and we did all our tours through him- fantastic value and local knowledge, really reliable and friendly. The jewellers on site is a real gem, excuse the pun!, and will make anything you like at superb value. Had some earrings and a ring made with diamonds and white sapphire for £500! Would recommend a water safari to see local wildlife and buda temple, local tea plantation, local auryvedic herb gardens where they will massage lots of natural potions into you, and also galle which are fairly local things to do. Unfortunately the elephant sanctuary up in the north was a little too far- about 6 hours away. Some people did do this excursion from our hotel but a very long day. So all in all one of the best holidays we've had. My parents did say that having stayed in lots of wonderful hotels that this one was lovely but not quite the added touches you might find in some other locations (like lovely toiletries and other luxuries) although they had a fantastic time and would thoroughly recommend it and go back. Only downfall was that it is a long transfer from the airport - about 3 hours. But once you get there you can relax and forget about that. Weather fine although rainier season so did have a few showers but still hot and rain didn't last for long. Enjoy!",positive
A great place to relax away from the hustle and bustle of a major city. All the staff were friendly and could not do enough for you. Heritance is an impressive hotel situated in an idyllic location and the weather in July was perfect. The food and range of restaurants catered for all tastes and was inexpensive.,positive
"Well having had a long flight and a long drive I may have been slightly over tired but my first impressions of the hotel and the room was disappointment. It does come down to taste but I found the hotel is characterless. Our room was good but without the two extra beds for the children which was irritating as my husband had emailed the hotel directly confirming them but they were set up quickly and our request for table lamps in the lounge rather than overhead lighting met as quickly. The children loved the pools and I absolutely hated breakfast! It was enough to bring tears to your eyes the oppressive dining room the scrum around the breakfast bar seemingly at all times, the awful service. I had so many variations on getting a cup of earl grey they were green tea, warm milk, teabags and nothing else including water or a cup, they ran out of tea bags I supplied my own and then tea arriving 30 minutes later when you're just about to leave. In the land of bountiful fruit why are 3 out of 5 breakfast juices made from concentrate or nearer to cordial? Can they not default to 4 place servings, then if 2 come to breakfast they are happy and if 4 come down they are instantly satisified a win win rather than waiting 10 minutes for cutlery for 2 of the party. Can they not allocate a server to families staying longer than 3 nights thus establishing a rapport. Saying that the service elsewhere was fine. The food ranged from adequate to good. Amal's in Bentota was excellent for sea food and Refresh in Hikkaduwa(45 mins) had an enormous choice and was very good. The location was ok , Galle was an hour drive Bentota about 30 minutes. We did take some trips to Udawlawe 4 hours each way and Sinharaja 3 hours each way. As mentioned in previous reviews the beach is effectively out of bounds if you do not wish to be pursued by the local tour guides and hawkers. It could be a great hotel with adequate staff training to instill a sense of ownership and pride, a rethink of the decor, a complete overhaul of the main dining room practices, some investment in soft furnishings. Despite its short comings we thought the Heritance was good value for money.",negative
"18 years as a National Cricketer has taken me all over the world and I have had the privilege of staying at the most desirable places. I have also had the opportunity of staying over in the cream of hotels in my motherland as a guest and as a National Cricketer and though I am not comparing the services, I must pen my thoughts on my heartfelt feelings of the memorable and historical stay at Heritance Ahungalla which I consider an important milepost in my life. This is because of this test cricket match played at the Galle Stadium from 18th to 22nd July, 2010 being my final test match where I bid adieu to Test Cricket. It is also memorable to me because of my achievement in my cricketing career - 800 wickets the highest number taken by any cricketer so far. We, me and my mates and our families checked into Heritance Ahungalla on 13th July, 2010 and the warm welcome extended to us from the time we stepped out of the bus is a memory that would linger in my mind for a very very long time. The friendly smiling faces of the staff, from the highest rank to the lowest, came to greet us, offering thirst quenches. The beautiful architecture of another Sri Lankan Legend- Jeffory Bawa, hit me at once. The carpet of blue (pool and the sea being at the same level) waves a warm salty welcome to the tired travellers. Comfortable, spacious and clean rooms and the services rendered by the staff, is the Hallmark of Heritance Ahungalla. The standard of food catered to the national and international pallet is scrumptious and plenty. It is not surprising though, since the hotel is in possession the internationally acclaimed Olympic Gold Medalist - Chef Dimuthu Kumarasinghe in their Culinary Team. It takes one Celebrity to know another!!!! As a national cricketer, who needs to keep his mind, body and the total being in peaceful tact, the services offered, quality of food, facilities available, restful environment, recognition given, entertainment provided for relaxation, should be par excellence and I would say - ""Hats Off to Heritance Ahungalla - Our stay at your hotel is Memorable"". My wife Mathimalar and my Son Naren, have taken a great liking and love to your Hotel. We definitely will visit you, may be not as a National Cricketer, but as a loyal guest, because we know your service would be the same. It is only right that I thank the Management and the rest of the staff, for the fantastic service given right throughout our stay at your hotel. I would like to specially mention the following which touched my heart immensely: Grand Welcome extended to all our Team Members and our families; Giving me the great honour of declaring open the new office of the Olympic Gold Medalist - Chef Dimuthu Kumarasinghe; For organizing cocktails and entertaining us; Celebrating birthdays of the Cricketers and appreciation of their performance; Giving the Sri Lankan Cricket Team the honour in being a part of their staff activities - Opening of Staff Restaurant (Samudra Restaurant); Hosting my family and friends for a special and intimate dinner at the Supper Club of the Hotel; For the Grand and Mind Blowing Ceremony organized in par with my farewell to Test Cricket - Some of the pictures I will attach hereto. Here I must mention that I was completely taken by surprise and my family members were thrilled that such recognition and importance given to me by the Hotel. This celebration will remain in my memory even when I grow old. Last but not the least, the most beautiful, wonderful show piece cake created by Chef Dimuthu Kumarasinghe personally on my behalf. I'm so touched overwhelmed of this fact and I think it is a privilege no other cricketer in the world had been able to experience. This is what I call SSS (Super Style of Service). But I am sorry that I can't eat and keep the cake together!!! So this is the Hotel with which I would associate as the pinnacle of the most unforgettable achievement and finally I would say ""Murali endorses Heritance Ahungalla with pleasure"".

"Heritance Ahungalla is not by any standards a 4,5 star hotel. We have chosen it for our honeymoon trip as pictures seen on the website looked amazing and we also read many good reviews. However, our stay there turn out to be a great dissapointment and we won't be going back. To list just few problems you may encounter there : it is impossible to go for a walk on the beach as you are constantly pestered by locals who do not take no for an answer; cockroaches can be found not only on hotel corridors but also inside the rooms; the cutlery served at tables has leftovers of food stuck to it; the bed linen in the rooms as well as the curtains are stained and often with holes; the hotel provides hardly any toiletries and if so, they are stuck on the bottom of a ceramic bottles in a very small quantitiy; there are constant problems with electricity and it can go off for over 30mins at time. As for the service it is probably one of the most tiresom and annoying problems of all, as there is no communication between the team members serving meals in the restaurant, you need to ask several times for a pot of coffee or a bottle of water, provided that you will be understood by the waiter on the first occassion. If so, the requested drink may not be delivered at all, while few other team memers will approach with exactly the same question about your choice of drink but it will take ages for someone to actually deliver it to the table. The tips are expected while the service quality or rather its lack, does not jusitfy it at all. The most imposing are often the housekeeping supervisors (not the regular housekeepers- they work very hard and hardly ever strike a conversation with a guest), who can follow you down the corridor repeating few times that they are entirely responsible for cleaning your room....all obviously to be tipped. In case of any problems with the room calling reception is normally a waste of time, as you have to call back several times before someone turns up to deal with the problem. The hotel is full of damp and looks as if its times of glory have long gone. We have been travelling extensively over last couple of years throughout Africa and Asia and we are very much aware of difficulties some developing countries face, however we cannot find an explanation for advertising a very poor quality hotel as a 4,5 star resort.",negative
"Have just returned from 2 weeks at the Heritance and overall it was a disappointing experience, primarily because the service was so mixed, ranging from good, to indifferent, to frankly poor. My wife and I travelled with our 13 year old son, and we stayed in 2 adjacent luxury rooms, which were slightly tired, but extremely spacious, and thoroughly cleaned every day. A word of warning to anyone travelling with younger children, we had made 3 advance requests via our Tour Operator ""Kuoni"", for inter connecting rooms. We received no reply, and were only advised on arrival that the hotel has no interconnecting rooms. The 2 hotel pools are large and well maintained, one offering some limited organised activities and the other residents' pool offering a quieter option. The hotel and grounds are spacious, and even though the hotel was fully occupied for part of our stay, it never felt over crowded. We had opted for bed and breakfast, so didn't experience the buffet, all inclusive option. However a few of our fellow guests did and commented that the food was good quality, but repetitive if staying for 2 weeks. We mainly ate in the Coffee Shop restaurant where the food was good, and given a supposed 5 star hotel, we thought the prices were reasonable. Dining out options in the village of Ahungalla are non existent. If you walk out of the hotel complex, you are quickly surrounded by several locals, offering TukTuk rides, boat safaris, and numerous trips. They are persistent but never threatening, and several firm "" no thank you"" will usually see them retreat. The village does have a pharmacy and a bank. If you are cashing travellers cheques, it is worth the 5 minute stroll to the bank as it offers a significantly better exchange rate than the hotel. For dining out you need to get a taxi or a TukTuk to Bentota or else to HIkkaduwa. Bentota has several hotels and is 20 minutes in a taxi or about 25/30 minutes in a TukTuk. The drivers will wait for you and negotiate a return trip price. A hotel taxi was about £20 for a return trip, with the tuktuks costing about half of that. The best restaurant we found was the Golden Grill, good for curries and seafood. Dinner for 3 people with beer and soft drinks was typically £30 to £40 in total. Main frustration came with the inconsistent service in the hotel. At breakfast, there was a great range of food, and all well presented, and plenty of staff on hand. Unfortunately it wasn't unusual for 3 different waiters to approach you to ask whether we wanted tea or coffee, but then none of them would get round to serving it. The pool attendants are helpful but want tipping continually and the room cleaners changed several times and all made subtle overtures for tips. Reception staff were always smiling, but poorly trained and inefficient with simple requests having to be made several times before anything got done. After the first week we found a great guy working reception and just made sure we dealt with him. Some lovely staff serving drinks around the pool, always friendly and helpful. Wandering onto the beach is spoilt because the locals will lie in wait and then follow you round trying to sell you gouges or trips. They will ask your name and if you give it, they will stand at the edge of the hotel property calling to you while you try and relax on your sun bed. Again they aren't threatening in any way, just persistent and something of a pain. Just keep saying ""no thank you"" and they will eventually give up ! Overall, the Heritance is nice but dated hotel, but represents pretty reasonable value for what it is. The location is isolated but the grounds and pools are good, and the rooms are fine. It has the potential to offer a relaxed, get away from it all style resort, IF the management could get their act together and get the service to a consistently efficient level.",negative
"The welcome back for the sri lanka cricket team and for murali's retirement from test cricket was simply outstanding. the attention to detail and the acquisition was very good. the fact that all were allowed to participate, staff and guests, was touching and very much appreciated. it was certainly a historic and touching moment, not only for murali's family but for all those who were fortunate enough to be at the heritance ahungall hotel. The cake ! who's idea was that ? really very clever, congratulations to all involved in the making of the cake,it was so very thoughtful that a nice piece of cake was offered to everyone present. what a splendid finale! perfectly executed! Kind Rgds, Steven & Jemie",positive
"This is definately not a 5 star hotel, it's decor is very shabby, bed linen is off colour, stained and has seen better days. There isn't an on complex shop so you have to buy everything in the bar and trying to get out of the hotel main gate to the road is a nightmare as the locals swarm around the en trance ready to pounce on you, they find it very difficult to take ""no"" for an answer. The same goes for the beach, you cannot get on it in without being harassed as they line the edge of the hotel grounds. Would not recommend booking holidays thru the rep as these are double the price of using the hotel taxi's to take you to the same places. If you are not giving the locals, be it where ever you are, tips for this that and everything then they are very abrupt and can't get rid of you quick enough, especially the rep! They want tips for putting a cushion and towel on your sunlounger and then when it rains they want another one for putting it back again.",negative
"Maybe our expectations were different, but we didn’t get what we were hoping for with our three-day stgay at the Heritance Ahungalla. We thought that an all-inclusive resort would be a relaxing base of operations but found that we were pretty much sequestered on the property. We wanted to get out and about during the day or night and the operation and setting did not lend themselves to that – the Heritance wants to capture all of your money during your visit. Rooms were clean and nicely appointed but small. High premiums for everything, from bottled water to laundry to room service to internet. Food options were limited and consistently underwhelming. Front desk and concierge staff were not particularly helpful when we did ask for suggestions for activities or dining off of the property. Should we find ourselves back on the coast in Sri Lanka we will look for a smaller hotel closer to one of the towns or villages, not an all-inclusive resort.",neutral
"We decided to stay at Heritance Ahungalla as it was designed by an architect that we like - Geoffrey Bawa. Later we realized so are many hotels en route Ahungalla from Colombo. Having said that, it sure is a beautiful hotel with two vast pools overlooking the beach. The brand is all about the blend of tradition and modernity. The service staff were all in their white sarongs with white shirts. The rooms were a bit disappointing. We requested for a triple room and realized that it is a double with an extra bed. We really thought there would be more space. The maintenance was not as good and lamp shades were falling off. For a property of that size and price the in-room amenities were dated including a large tube television that juts into the walk path. There were a lot of renovation going on and we had to walk through scaffolding all the time. We also had this noon drills and plumbing noise that would not let us take that much needed siesta. The food was again a strong blend of Lankan and Continental. I was ok with an odd piece of dried fish in my food. My wife and kids were not. So I had to taste the dishes before they ate. But the traditional food was enjoyable and we gorged. There is a fine dining restaurant in the property and I would rate that very high. The pools were fabulous - clean, well maintained and addictive. The gym was old, grubby and rusted (most of the equipment were not usable). When we go to Sri Lanka again we will not go south as it is intended to rip off unsuspecting tourists. And so we will not stay at Heritance Ahungalla either. I think all properties in that stretch of Bentota, Ahungalla are overrated. I would rather stay in a boutique property at Fort Galle.",neutral
"Having returned on 11th June after 12 nights at this hotel on vacation with my wife, I feel the need to express my gratitude for such an amazing holiday. My wife and I were married in Sri Lanka last year and we fell in love with Sri Lanka - we felt compelled to return to celebrate our 1st anniversary (but this time at a different hotel). As soon as we arrived - the first impressions were..........wow. The brochures do not do this stunning hotel justice. Having had a long tiring journey, we were given a very warm welcome. We stayed in a Suite which was superb in every way. The rooms are serviced daily by friendly housekeeping staff to a very very high standard. I am a Executive Chef who is in charge of a group of Companies providing Fine Dining Catering with bespoke menu's to wealthy clientele, so I was intrigued to find out whether this 5* hotel would impress. I need not have questioned this thought. After talking to The Food and Beverage Manager, I was invited to look around the kitchens and meet their brigade. The kitchens were immaculate, staff spotless, motivated and relaxed in their work - delivering the most delicious fine dining experience. With Sri Lanka's top medal winning Chef at the helm this comes as no surprise. If it is fantastic food and excellent service you require, then look no further. We will definitely return.",negative
"We stayed at Heritance Ahungalla from 3rd to 16th May 2010 and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We were made very welcome by all of the staff and the hotel is very striking when you arrive. The initial room we were given had a problem with the air-conditioning that couldn't be fixed until the following day but we were promptly moved to another room, third floor above the restaurant and couldn't fault it and slept really well. Spacious clean room with a beautiful bed, heavy internal screens help to keep the room dark and cool, tea and coffee making facilities provided and topped up twice daily when towels were changed and beds turned down. Had a problem one day with a cockroach in the bathroom but Housekeeping were quick to attend to it and after all you are in a tropical environment. Beach staff were wonderful and two fantastic pools, beach touts were a bit of a nuisance at times, but easy enough to deal with. Ate most days in the hotel and found plenty to eat at both breakfast and dinner and food and drinks bill for 13 days was £290 for the two of us. Twice invited to Management Cocktail parties, and the night club re-opened for the season just as we were leaving otherwise not a lot to do in an evening. Took the train to Galle one day and bus back and had a two day trip to the Elephant Orphanage and Kandy which we throughly enjoyed. Lots of rest and relaxation and husband had a very nice massage in the Spa before we came home. Would we go back, probably yes but would look to try a different area as there wasn't a lot within walking distance of the hotel. If you are hesitating over choosing this hotel then don't, would recommend it to anyone and the overiding memory is how wonderful the staff were. They are genuinly interested in getting to know you and helping you and nothing is too much trouble they really are a credit to the hotel and to Sri Lanka. Overall had a wonderful holiday and made many friends amongst the staff",positive
"I had seen some excellent pictures of this place and was pleasantly surprised that the place did justice to the pictures and vice versa. The infinity pool extending from the lobby is the focus of this charming resort. What is even more remarkable is that this resort suffered greatly when the tsunami hit coastal Sri Lanka and the management put it back together very quickly. The rooms are cosy, ours was a little away from the central pool area and room service took a little longer. The balconies are perfect for a quiet cup of SriLankan tea or a beer depending on the time of the day. Dont miss the antique lift in the lobby. The buffet lunch and dinner are excellent with a sumptuous variety of food though vegetarians may have fewer choices. Make sure you have room for the desserts. As is the case with most Sri Lankan resorts, the staff go out of their way to make you comfortable.",positive
"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Heritance. The hotel had everything one could ask for with a professional service. The beach was clean and all windows had a sea-view. Food was excellent and the whole ambience was marvellous. I will surely go there again, but maybe on a personal trip instead of official. Its soooooo romantic :)",positive
"Heritance Ahungalla is a place that will immediately bring your pulse rate down. A great atmosphere to relax, soak in the sun and enjoy a huge spread of Sri Lankan food. Geoffery Bawa's characteristic infinity pool, the sound of the crashing waves and the setting sun are guaranteed to put you in a mellow mood. The bar by the pool is nice and has a band playing in the evenings. There is another fairly large pool by the fitness centre. The spa was average. Rooms were large and clean. Strong smell of cinnamon oil - which I loved. We were there for a conference and the hotel agreed to arrange a Mongolian barbeque for us on the beach which, unfortunately, was rained out. The following night we opted to use the Night Club. The beach is clean - touts will point you in the direction of cheaper massages and shacks offering fresh sea food on the beach, both of which we did not try out.",positive
"We have just returned from a 2 week stay at the heritance. We travelled as a family of 2 children 2 and 4 yrs plus granparents. We had an excellent time and would not hesitate to recommend this hotel. The architexture is stunning with a very calm atmosphere and a wonderful infinity pool that blends into the beach. The pictures don't do it justice. We stayed in their 2 interconnecting rooms 301 and 302 which were spacious and had excellent see views. They made them up as a king size and 2 singles which suited us great. You could hear the entertainment but it finished at a reasonable time. The ""animators"" were really helpful, building sandcastles and flying kites with the children. We all enjoyed the daily aqua aerobics. One of the best things about the hotel and sri lanka is the poeple. The were very friendly and genuine and made our stay one to remember. The service was very occasionally slightly chaotic in a nice sri lankan way, but everyone was very helpful. The food was the best that we tasted anywhere on our trip in the hotel. Breakfast is excellent and the food in the coffee shop was v tasty. The chinese and BBQ buffets were worth it and we weren't charged for the children. Drink prices were reasonable (we were charged twice as much in the hotel on our trip to Kandy). We did some trips around the area with Bertie from the sunshine resturant at the end of the beach. I would definitely recommend the river safari as not to be missed. This is an excellent choice for those looking for relaxation in a stunning setting. There is the option to explore locally and futher afield. We can't thank the hotel enough for an excellent stay, (they are happy to be contacted with room requests before you travel). We would go again!",negative
We went as part of a much larger group here. The pool was large and therefore could accommodate a large number of people. The hotel was clean and had a very calm atmosphere to it. The room we had was very spacious with a very large bathroom. There was 24 room service and they served up food and beverages when called. The beds were big and comfy - the downside was the 21 inch CRT TV and for the price we were paying that could have been better. The downside to this hotel was the food at the buffet (lunch and dinner). The selection was very limited and not up to standard. Your probably better off ordering from room service - I did enjoy that. The service at this hotel was extremely good and the staff pleasant - from the dining room to the bar to the room service attendants. I would say for a great place to relax and be pampered this is one of the places to go.,positive
Heritance architecture is remarkable and the rooms are spacious and very comfortable. It is a fun place to go in a group as their is just the resort to enjoy....very nice pool can spend half a day their itself!!!! massage was not up to the mark and food was a big disappointment.,neutral
"We were planning to stay for 5 nights at the Heritance but ended up staying for 6 because of the volcano (we then moved to the Club Villa in Bentota). I booked the Heritance to contrast with the very small hotel we stayed at in Unawatuna so the children would have more to do. The setting is beautiful with two stunning swimming pools that feel virtually on the beach and never seemed busy at all. The gardens are very big with lots of trees if you want to be in the shade and the pool attendants move the sunbeds wherever you want and are very helpful. We had three double deluxe rooms on the second floor for the six of us that looked over the garden (you could see the sea if you leant over the balcony). It would have been nicer to have had a full sea view, but the rooms themselves were fine - very clean and comfortable with great showers. The balconies were big enough to comfortably sit on and it was very quiet. The beach is absolutely beautiful and the sea lovely, although it can be very dangerous at certain times of the year. The food at breakfast was excellent - a buffet with everything from traditional Sri Lankan hoppers, curries and soups to every kind of eggs, pancakes, waffles, omelettes, bacon .... Lots of fresh fruit but horrid concentrated fruit juices. The only, but annoying, quibble at breakfast was that it seemed impossible to get a cup of tea - there are armies of staff but no one seems to actually do anything. The food generally was quite good didn't really work for a family of six. The half-board option gave you the buffet supper that was rather expensive and disappointing so we only did that once. There is a very smart looking restaurant that would probably be lovely if there were only two of you, but we felt rather forced to stick to the coffee shop (better than it sounds!) where the menu was fine, but somewhat limited. You had a feeling that you were stuck in the middle of nowhere and the hotel rather exploited this which was slightly annoying. Charging for the internet and for the use of the dreadful tennis court (why did we cart all our tennis rackets all the way to Sri Lanka?!) seemed rather mean-spirited. My husband and sons used the gym and thought it was fine and played table tennis and crazy golf. On our last night the hotel was virtually full so we all moved into a suite on the third floor at the far end of the hotel. It was a stunning room with sitting-room and massive balcony with beautiful sunset views and would have made a perfect honey-moon spot (not quite so romantic with four teenagers camped out on the floor!). I would recommend the Heritance because of its beautiful setting but probably a four night stay would be enough.",positive
"We liked this hotel very much. It belongs to the company Aitken Spence and is one of its best hotels. Aitken Spence has 9 hotels on Sri Lanka and 8 on Maldives also they have tea plantation and make 4 - 15 and more days excursions and there are very talented guides. We were especially pleased with our guide and driver in one person with whom we traveled for 5 days. His name is Amereseri (tourists call him Gaston). He is working for Aitken Spence for 25 years. So if you will book your tour - better do it with this company and choose this guide, he is very attentive, experienced, he is the best. The ocean is beautiful, the sand is clean, the sky is blue. What else do you need??) The hotel is very clean and new one, all rooms are ocean view. They except cards so you can easily pay with it. Buffet breakfast is every day the same, but dinners were especially tasty- seafood and others. If you want to eat somewhere else out of hotel - you can go to the place that is called restaurant not far from Heritance. Locals are always annoying and proposing to go to this resto. It is not tidy there but do not mind because seafood there is excellent (we liked king prawns- very delicious). BUT FROM ENDLESS PLUSES THERE IS ONE MINUS. We made friends with people who stayed at this hotel the same time as we did, and somebody stole 200 dollars from their room. Money was in the inner pocket of the girl`s bag. They did it in such a way that there was nobody to blame. Room boy told that he came to their room to tidy it but he broke the key in the door and went away and started to clean another room. So maybe it was not he but another room boy who used this situation.Of course it was not the last money they had but they were disappointed cause everything was so good and the last day a little bit spoilt. They did not call police (but we read a lot of reviews that if smbd stoles smth on Sir Lanka better to call police and maybe they will return it). SO ALWAYS LEAVE MONEY JEWELRY AND OTHER PRECIOUS THINGS IN THE SAFE because it seems that they are looking through your belongings - that is not pleasant. But if not this case I will never believe that those pleasant, always smiling people can do such things. There is also internet in the library, you can buy card at the reception (1 hour - 2,5 dollars). If you are a romantic person - take the book of Maureen Lee ""Stepping stones"" from the library, I left it there, it is very interesting. Take with yourself cremes not to get sunburn. But I noticed that almost all people there become very very red burnt because the sun there is very strong. Everybody`s skin!!!!! flakes when you return from Sri Lanka. So, be careful. I highly recommend you to stay in this hotel, you will be very satisfied!!! Wish you good weather and exciting holidays!! Regards from Ukraine",positive
"When we arrived at the Heritance Ahungalla, we were pleasantly surprised by the exotic setting nestled amongst coconut groves and lush green vegetation. We could barely wait to jump into the infinity pool that looked directly onto the beach with the roaring waves of the Indian Ocean in the background. It was perfect. Don't get me wrong we did have some issues To read more; http://tinyurl.com/y58cyvl",positive
"There isn't a lot in the surrounding area but that does not matter as you won't want to leave the hotel. The service is good, the rooms are very nice indeed and the location is perfect if you just want to sit on a sunlounger for a week and drink cocktails. All the staff are lovely and the restaurants are nice. Our favourite was the Coffee Shop which was a lovely restaurant overlooking the beautiful swimming pool. Thanks to Dayal who looked after us impeccably. The management are very focused on good customer service. It's a long way to go for a week (from the UK) but we'd do it again.",positive
Room was not that good.... first night we could not sleep due to hotel maintenance noise. Food was good... but only if you like spicy .... surrounding was nice...nice beach.... secure... nice pool.,neutral
"We stayed in Heritance for 2 weeks and it was a great time! Nice rooms, amazing ocean view and what's more: DELICIOUS FOOD !!! It's peaceful, relaxing place, maybe not for people looking for fun and entertainment... not much to do in the evenings, but perfect for those who really want to relax. There are lots of places worth visiting in further and closer area. If You want to go for a trip we can really advise a local tour-operator Mr Sumana Siri De SIlva. We used his 'tuk tuk' services everytime we wanted to go somewhere. He charmed us with his good heart, honesty and engagement in his work. If You would like to go with him somewhere just call him: [--]he will come always on time! Ask him also to take You to spice garden 'Happy Lanka' for massage... You will feel like newly born :-) We cordially recommend !!!",positive
"Stayed for two nights found the room to be disappointing, small and a bit dirty, net curtains were stained as well as the rug on the floor very marked. Only one towel in room until more brought at 6pm which was a bit late. Toiletries supplied very poor, bathroom needed a good clean. Found the buffet to be disappointing and dishes not refilled very often also one night the vegetables were very undercooked, also little choice. Breakfast buffet good. Pool and beach lovely. snacks from pool bar good also.",negative
Our 6th visit to this hotel & we would say that it is better in most aspects than before the tsunami damage. Transport would be needed to venture to places of interest such as Galle -we would not recommend using public transport . The beach traders were no problem to us . Special thanks to Sampath De Silva at F&B & Mr Gamage for making our stay so enjoyable abeyjackie,positive
"A perfect relaxing holiday. It does what it says on the tin. Located directly on a long stretch of sandy, deserted beach and within large tropical gardens. The sea can be rough, but good fun, the two pools are large, clean and inviting. Rooms are well furnished and modern/classy, we stayed in a one bedroomed suite which was excellent. Food is very good with a choice of local and international dishes, drinks are fairly priced. The service was excellent, all staff we met, including cleaners, waiters and management had good positive attitudes and really tried hard to satisfy at all times. We felt this was one of the best all round relaxing beach holidays we have had.",positive
"The title says it all really.After completing a 8 day tour of the island,we were definitely ready for our 8 night beach holiday and our choice of hotel couldnt have been better. We dined in all the resteraunts and really enjoyed the mustard and fine dining options.The in room dining selection was also ideal and eating breakfast on our balcony whilst gazing over the Indian ocean was a great start to the day Our room was very comfortable and kept spotless by our room boy(The air conditioning was bliss!!).The thing that really stands out at this hotel are the staff,the friendliness and service is second to none,we were greeted by the reception staff on our arrival as valued customers and made to feel special.I also had the pleasure of speaking to the room division manager(Arju),who whilst welcoming my posive opinions regarding the hotel, also seemed keen to hear any negative issues.I couldnt help him with any negative aspects!! This is a very well run hotel with amazing staff,a great choice for a romantic holiday.",positive
A great hotel and beach location. We were not after somewhere that was in the middle of one of the large tourist areas and the Heritance provided just what we were after. Somewhere where we could walk on a beach and not be mobbed by beach boys or other tourists. There are some beach sellers by the hotel but they are friendly and after a while leave you alone. The staff at the hotel are attentive although sometimes seem to take awhile in returning with your order but that been said they are always smiling. The rooms were large enough for our needs and room service always asked how we were and if we had any other reqiurements. If you want to explore try the cycle ride with Charmin from the hotel around the local area or take the local Tuk-Tuk with Raja (orange shirt) from the front gate. He gave a great tour taking us off the beaten path and into the local community. A good price and very knowledgable. We'll be back.,positive
"We could not fault the welcome we received - it was a delight to find many of the pre -tsunami staff still in the hotel. The refurbishment has been really well done with rooms looking smart and well designed. We ate in three of the locations and enjoyed some excellent food which was professionally served with enthusiasm and politeness. If we had any disappointment it was in the wine which we thought was very expensive and due to the hot weather, not always of good quality.",positive
"We got excited seeing the brochures however when we arrived it exceed all our expectations. The reception was warm and courteous, rooms are well appointed and excellent service. We tried the restaurants for dinner and B/f, the spread was truly international. The pool is out of the world. The staff were very helpful. One must visit the hotel and dont miss the drive to Galle and the nearby tutle farm.",positive
"This hotel has a lovely atmosphere, Beautifully re-done.The three hour ""hell"" trip from the airport, made it worth it, as this is a little treasure. The rooms are beautifully done, and service is excellent.Would love to visit there again!",positive
"This ought to be a great hotel but it ends up only being a good one. It lets itself down on a couple of fronts. First the good - the food is excellent both in the main restaurant and the fine dining restaurant. In particular we were very impressed with the team that look after the pool bar and the fine dining room. Worthy of particular mention are the guys in Lakmal's team including Dilan, Kolitha and Silva who were chatty without being intrusive and went out of their way to help. Dinesh made sure that a birthday celebration in the fine dining restaurant was special and memorable. Also the pools are very large and the main pool is really beautiful. The hotel is justifiably proud of having been designed by Sri Lanka's most celebrated architect Geoffrey Bawa. The view as you arrive at reception is fantastic looking right through the hotel lobby and over the beach to the sea. Unfortunately our experience of the front desk staff is they manage to be both obsequious and a bit too full of how good they think the hotel is at the same time. We were particularly annoyed when they failed to pass on two important messages from our tour operator. The rooms also look the part at first but fall victim to style over substance. There are so many hotel 'ornaments' that you have to clear loads of stuff out of the way to put your own belongings away. The light over the desk is hung so low that you bang your head on it whilst it manages to keep the mirror above the desk in complete shade. You have to ring housekeeping to ask for many of the things we found provided automatically in other hotels such as adaptors and mosquito repellers. You also need to make use of the Do Not Disturb sign pretty much whenever you are in the room or you are likely to find your bed being turned down at 6 in the evening! We also experienced power failures on almost every evening - not the end of the world in themselves but it would have been nice to have had a torch in the room instead of sitting in complete darkness until the power came back on. The bathroom was one of the biggest disappointments as it only contain a shower. We asked twice about moving to a room with a bath and once were told there were no rooms with baths and the second time were asked for $100 per night to move to a room with a bath. On both occassions we were told we could use the jacuzzi near the resident's pool if we wanted a bath although we were never brave enough to stroll down there in the altogether with our soap and shampoo! The jacuzzi is actually a cheap plastic afterthought that would have Mr Bawa turning in his grave. In summary this hotel did not impress as much as other hotels we stayed in during our trip. It charged for things such as internet usage and had not done a great job of anticpating our needs in a way that other hotels did that did not cost anywhere near as much as this one and it would probably not be on our list of places to go back to or to recommend on that basis.",neutral
"We stayed at this hotel for twelve days and expected more from a hotel with a deluxe reputation. The greatest asset this hotel has are its staff. They were simply excellent, so very friendly, exceptionally eager to please and polite and courteous at all times. You would find it difficult to find a better hotel staff anywhere. The food in the buffet restaurant was of a high standard and a perfect mix of Sri Lankan and International dishes. The food in the fine dining restaurant was even better and probably better than manyy top restaurants in London. The hotel is located right on the beach andmost of the rooms have a great sea view. There are many beach venders, but we did not find this too much a problem as they quickly learnt not to bother you once you made it clear you were not interested. Yes, there are many positives to this hotel, but unfortunately it does not deserve a deluxe rating. First impression are so important and this hotel is let down by being in need of care and attention. For example the furnishings in the public areas were stained and needed replacing and much of the woodwork needed attention. The tablecloths in the dining room were frequently filthy (unacceptable and easily rectified) and all the linen needed to be renewed. Many of the sunbeds were broken and needed replacing and wer covered with dirty matresses. However, the pool attendents were excellent and helped to make up for these problems. Our overall impression of this hotel was that it required significant investment to bring it up to an acceptable standard for a deluxe hotel. The hotel is saved by its excellent staff and fabulous food; two of the most impotant factors for a successful hotel. Would we return, possibly, but only if standards were improved. There are many boutique hotels opening in Sri Lanka and the Heritance needs to be able to match the very high standard that these hotels set.",negative
We felt at home from the moment we arrived. The staff were all exceptional and the service was fantastic. The food was amazing and so plentiful. A really beautiful hotel.,positive
"After a 6 hour drive we were welcomed to Heritance Ahungalla with a drink and fast check in and shown to our rooms. We were upgraded to a suite which was a nice surprise and invited to the managers cocktail party. The rooms were very spacious, quiet and clean with wonderful views over the ocean. The pools and grounds were immaculately kept with staff to help you move day beds, supply towels and tend to your every need. The food was great in the restaraunts, but very dissapointing room service and pool bar/ outdoor cafe food - the ""hot"" food always came out cold and the icecream was served melted and the staff were not that keen to fix it. We wre lucky enough to be invited in to the kitchen for special cooking lessons which were wonderful. I found this hotel to be a wonderful place to relax and unwind at the end of a busy holiday.",negative
"I checked this hotel at tripadvisor before booking it and expected it to be nice and relaxing at the very least, however, the whole stay (we stayed there for 3 weeks) was a complete and utter disappointment! Looks like Heritance has changed a lot lately and it's surely not a 5* hotel anymore. After an almost 20-hour trip to the hotel, my only wish was to have a shower and lie down, however, we had to spent almost half an hour answering stupid questions about our anniversary, etc. The staff was too talkative and tactless even, several times we had spend almost the entire lunch in their company and nothing could possibly make them leave. All the advantages of this place faded away in comparison with its negative sides. Quite nice design of the room couldn't make up for holes in bedsheets, dirty curtains, breaking conditioning, old towels and other things. The food was really fabulous, however, when the evening food was under a set menu, almost all guest opted for the a la carte restaurant as the set menu was really poor and the meal lasted forever. The atmosphere was quite relaxing most of the time, however, there was no chance to even enter the pool as soon as weekend came and the hotel was fully packed with locals. Some things kept on spoiling our stay on every day basis. The beach area was constantly full of locals, who were trying to sell you a trip or whatever you wanted or didn't wanted. Even by the pool your every single movement was followed by their attempts to draw your attention. If you managed to escape and reach the ocean, several guys were waiting for you to come back. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! For the first time in my life I was looking forward for going home!!",negative
"This hotel has a grand entrance and everything to suggest exclusive luxury. Hotel landscape is huge with 2 large pools and over 100 guestrooms. If you are interested in a romantic getaway place, this may not be the place for you as there are many family travellers in general. The guestroom is spacious with modern decoration and overlooking the beach. Bathroom amenities can definitely be upgraded to match the luxurious atmosphere. The TV can be changed as well. The biggest selling point of this hotel is the food. Especially the 2 dinners included in the half board was absoloutely amazing and would highly recommend anyone visiting to do at least a half board as there aren't any places to eat outside the hotel. The dinner had a variety of freshly cooked seafood and a great mix of western and local dishes. One of the problem with this hotel is that they really need to try to controll the flies, flying everywhere in the hotel. Especially near the pool bars. Whether a electric device to control this problem or any other way, they definitely need to try and solve this problem as it gets really annoying when you want to have a nice drink at that bar. Oh and the Residen't pool is much nicer than the main pool! The staff were mostly very friendly and helpful! If only they would deliver the internet card to the room instead of asking us to pick it up from the front desk!",positive
"It used to be a great place, sadly, not any more. For $172 USD you can find more magic in many other locations in Srilanka's southern coast. Food was nothing fabulous, the restaurant had flies, really far too many. The servers were not on the ball, coffee was horrible. checking in was not smooth, towels (some) threadbear or torn. bathroom water clogged up. However, It was fixed without much fuss. Sorry, I am done with this hotel.",negative
"After having read some of the mixed reviews about this hotel I was a little worried, but after having visited and experienced the Heritance I really find myself asking “exactly what do some people expect or want”, We (my wife and I along with our 21 year old daughter and 18 year old son) visited in Dec 09 taking in New Years Eve 2010 and really I cannot fault the hotel. This comes from someone who as a rule is is not easily impressed by hotels. The New Years Eve Party was really such good fun, never seen so much varied food, great entertainment and fireworks on the beach. Generally food was good, even for those that are fussy eaters…you will find something you like, breakfasts buffets have all you could want, you wont find a better chicken sausage! Evening buffets are varied and offer great choice. The location of the hotel is on a wonderful beach, some complain about the beach sellers, for me they were no issue, yes they can be a little irritating but by and large providing you are firm in your request to be left alone (in a polite way please) then they will not bother you. We found them to be good fun and we got friendly with many of them, some are real characters and especially after we bought various items we had friends for life. These people are trying to earn a living and after the drop in tourism due to the Tsunami they have been having a really hard time. So please …whilst you are fortunate enough to holiday at the Heritance have a little sympathy and understanding for those poor folk who depend on the likes of us tourists for their income. So what if you spend a few Euros, pounds or whatever, it wont make any difference to you..but a whole lot of difference to them! Also if you have children/teenagers the sea can be deceiving, at certain times there can be quite a strong undertow and on two occasions some swimmers needed help to be brought to shore so just be careful, the sea is warm and blue, the sand is golden like powder, the beach goes on for miles so you can be lulled into a false sense of security! We all swam in the sea with no problems but you need to be sensible. The staff are truly amazing and really cannot do enough for you, I wont single any one member of staff as they were all as good as each other, I cannot praise them highly enough. The rooms are superb, most offering great views and are spacious and well appointed. In some previous reviews there were some claims that at weekends and holiday time the pool gets too busy/too noisy with non resident locals, well we were there at the peak of their main season and yes there were some locals but the pool is huge (but also spotlessly clean) and those visiting were always well behaved so this was never an issue, besides there is another huge pool for residents only. The pools really are magnificent and again perfectly situated, pool to beach, 45 seconds! And don’t ask me how but no sand in the pool! In the evening we went to the night club for Karaoke, a lot of fun. We stayed at the Heritance for 6 nights but next year we’ll stay for longer, lots to do in the surrounding area, swim with turtles, great snorkelling, Bentota water sports centre, river safari……plus more. We look forward to returning next year, so if you want a great hotel, in a great location, on a wonderful beach, with super staff and good food all wrapped up with a real resort atmosphere……the Heritance is for you.",positive
"We have just returned from a three week stay at the Heritance Hotel. Hotel was basically good, everything worked, including the staff who, if anything, could be overly attentive. Rooms were stylish, had plenty of storage space and were serviced twice daily. Balconies had views across the beach to the setting sun. Some guests complained of minor faults, e.g. our fridge broke down but was repaired the same morning. Food was a good as could be expected with Buffet Service and we were never bored, although the dining room could be noisy. The hotel is proud of its swimming pools and rightly so. Attentive pool boys and life guards ensure there is not the usual scramble for beds and towels. We actually preferred the second (residents) pool to that shown in all the literature. The beach was regularly cleaned and patrolled. Constant slight surf, no problems for even moderate swimmers but small children should be supervised. The hotel’s main drawback is its isolation. Locally, there is simply nowhere to go and little to do. Ahungalla village consists of some 70 yards of dilapidated shacks selling local produce and a few basics at blatantly ’tourist’ and local prices. There is also a passable bakery, a pharmacy, a bank with no ATM and a railway station at which few trains actually stop. There are two bus services and two qualities of bus i.e. Air Conditioned and Local. It is difficult to ascertain what is a public bus, as opposed to touring or private hire and even more difficult to have them stop. Heritance guests are not expected to want to walk anywhere, let alone get on a bus. The weather was good. It rained frequently but usually in late evening and accompanied by spectacular lightning. Mosquitoes are in evidence and, despite a wall plug device and sprays we were both bitten frequently. Guests attempting to leave the hotel by the main entrance have to run the gauntlet of a persistent group of motorised tricycle (Tuk Tuk) taxi drivers who will resort to any device to have you hire them. In addition, the driver will insist on waiting for you and interfere with your activities. Their constant attentions became oppressive, more so than had we stayed in Bentota or Hikkaduwa where there are more hotels, more activities, thereby more tourists to go around. Beach vendors were a nuisance but were not permitted onto hotel premises. A fellow female guests was accosted on the beach some 200yds from the hotel and robbed of her hat and wrap. This was however an isolated incident and we found the local people welcoming and keen to promote their countries new found stability. Expeditions were possible, 400 yards North along the beach to a fish restaurant shack is worthwhile. I ordered Lobster and drank a local beer whist two young men went out with snorkels and a net to retrieve one. 800yds south along the Galle road, on the left, is the Lucky Lanka Spice Garden and Ayurvidic Centre run by a charming young man. Full body massage for £10 and a large selection of herbal potions to buy at ‘local’ prices. Other worthwhile excursions are a tour of lagoon at Balapitaya (or Bentota) with a visit to one island to see cinnamon being hand rolled by a wonderful old man and his elfin grand daughter. A morning’s snorkelling by Some at International Dive Centre, located at Coral Sands Hotel in Hikkaduwa is good value where there is an excellent parade of fish, including Octopus. The coral was badly damaged in the Tsunami but hopefully showing signs of a return. If Temples and/or elephants are your thing, then there are further trips afield, e.g Kandy, Yala National Park and Burwela Bird Sanctuary. However, from Ahungalla, both entail an expenditure of over £110 pp, an overnight stay and between 5-7 hours in a minivan, each way. In summary; great hotel but we chose the wrong location for the type of holiday we enjoy. To get the best from Sri Lanka we would recommend dividing time between the Highlands, forests, wildlife parks and beaches. If however, you want a hotel based beach stay for a few days, you would be pushed to find better. Sri Lanka has great potential, stunning scenery, culture, a vibrant history and the most glorious beaches I have seen.",neutral
"As architects, and fans of Geoffrey Bawa, my wife and I stayed at this hotel in 1999 and had a great time. For old times sake we spent a night here in December 2009. The hotel has had a refurbishment after the tsunami, and while it is still a great place to visit, I am afraid it does not retain the earlier Bawa magic. The richness of the detailing is not the same, and the room interiors are quite ordinary. But the location, the view from the lobby onto the pool and beach beyond, still makes it a great place to be. There was some confusion at the reception when we arrived, and it took a little time to get a room, but once that was over the service was quite good. Food is good (but not outstanding). Enjoyed my stay, but will probably look for new experiences the next time I am in the region.",positive
"I stayed here for 2 days at the end of a long holiday travelling around Sri Lanka. The entrance is stunning and the building can,t fail to impress. I had a lovely room and the service was first class. The hotel has 2 wonderful pools with views of the ocean and there were activities for those needing to get out of the beach chairs. The beach is like much of the west coast, empty and the sea very pough but you could swim with care.",positive
"I would like to say having traveled the world a fair bit , this has to be the best service we have ever had. My wife and i were married at this hotel on the 9th Nov 2009 and we were so pleased that we chose it as we were a bit concerned as this was our dream wedding location. It turned out to be fantastic from the accommodation to the staff and especially the attention to detail on our wedding day and throughout our stay. The accommodation was excellent and the rooms were kept immaculate through out our stay. The service from the waiters was excellent as were all the staff they made us feel so special. The facilities were very good , the spa, was fantastic especially after using the well equipped gymnasium. The food was second to none and the variety of food was amazing and extremely well presented. The site seeing was very good, the elephant orphanage is a must as is the visit to the buddist temple. Locally the Turtle hatchery is worth a look as are the stilt fishermen. I would like to say that this holiday was amazing and would 100 percent recommend that if you are thinking about this location and hotel its a must . I believe the reason this holiday was exceptional was the hard work and dedication from all the staff from the manager to the guys who clean the rooms whose ethos is to make our dream holiday come true and they certainly did that . Thank you very much indeed. Gerry and Lesley",positive
"I travel alot but in this trip to Ahungalla , i had a perfect time and many good memories .hope to be back there soon.",positive
"This is what lazy beach holidays should be all about... Wake, eat, drink, pool, beach..... and that's what is done best at Ahungalla Heritance. The food - especially breakfast was absolutely brill! They also arranged for a dinner on the beach with lobster & the works which was delicious & not expensive. The pools were glorious to just loll about it and for a change, it was nice to walk up the few yards onto the beach without being swamped by vendors trying to make a sale. I guess it was off season so there was nothing much happening at the night club; but I dont think we cared. We enjoyed ourselves thoroughly!",positive
"Just returned from a wonderful 2 week stay.We were treated like royalty from start to finish! I cannot fault any aspect of our holiday! Excellent location right on the beautiful,long,sandy beach. Spacious,immaculate suite with all amenities and good sea view. Excellent food in all restaurants and the food and beverage manager personally checked each day to ask if we had any particular requests and made special meals to order! The staff really make this hotel quite special.We found without exception that all staff from gardeners,room staff,reception staff,beach/pool attendants,bar and restaurant staff were very friendly,very efficient and could not do enough to make sure all guests were happy with everything, even though they were often faced with very rude, ill mannered,arrogant and unappreciative guests mainly from outside the UK !! We met the new General Manager who was charming and very keen to maintain and improve the very high standards of this hotel.We hope he can market this hotel to encourage more couples only and less groups and families so that this wonderful hotel can remain the refined place it was designed to be. We look forward to returning to this hotel and seeing more of this lovely country. Thank you Heritance Ahungalla for a lovely holiday experience!",positive
"Actually I just come back from Srilanka November 09. I was been 2 days in Colombo,2 days in Kandy and 2 days in Ahungalla I thinks Heritance is the best hotel in srilanka. the stuff and services was good and respectful. very beautiful and colorful yard and a big and enjoyful swimming pool. I think it is deserved to be more than a five star hotel. the caltural show that held every nights in lobby is not good and should be replaced by a more enjoyful program I recommend this hotel and I'm sure that you will happy if you are looking for full servive and relaxation",positive
"I have just returned form 10 days at the Heritance with my girlfriend and can honestly say there wasnt any aspect fo the hotel that was disappointing. I work for a top tour operator in england and have travelled around the world staying at many top hotels. The service at the Heritance matched, if not exceeded many of these. The pools were fantastic...clean, great suze and we had one of the two at leat to ourselves on many occasions..it was great!! Below are some further comments: Room - was brilliant. It was a great size, really nicely furnished, clean with a great bathroom. Great views to pool and ocean. Cleaned daily. Food - amazing! we were on ahalf board basis and te food was superb. Great choice, different them every day, fresh, beautiful curries! Service - amazing. The staff were so attentive it was incredible. They were polite and friendly all the time. They alwas say hello and and make a real rapport with you throughout the time we were there. Beach - lovely but you do get hounded a bit by the touts when you walk on it. Just ignore them if you want them to leave you alone. Theyre firendly though. The sea is a bit rough so you cant really swim in it. Touts - if you want to get a taxi just ask one of the touts for a tuk tuk Its so much cheaper than the hotel taxis. We had the same driver for the whole 10 days and he was great. He took us to lots of places cheaply and was a safe driver. Dont be scared to use one..youll probably be a bit nervous the first time you get in one but then you can get their number and as soon as you want to go somewheer give them a call and theyll come and pick you up. Overall..couldnt fault our time at the heritance in any way. Ive read some of the negative reviews on this site and cant really understand what theyre on about. One said this hotel was dated which is complete rubbish! Feel free to email me if you have any questinos or want to know more. Nick",negative
"We visited the Heritance Ahungalla in September having arrived on an early morning flight from Singapore. The journey from Colombo to the hotel took about 3 hrs but unlike some previous reports we did not find the"" Sri Lankan driving experience"" too alarming.On arrival at the hotel the reception staff were delightful and completed the check-in process quickly. Indeed the attitude of reception personnel was reflected throughout the hotel, but of particular note was Mr Arju Vijayarajah really did go the ""extra mile"" to ensure our stay was comfortable. We stayed in a deluxe room with Ocean view and found the accommodation to be nicely proportioned with a good sized balcony. Also worthy of comment is the food which was well cooked and well presented. Altogether it was peaceful and relaxing experience.",positive
"Wow what a place to get married. Beautiful hotel with friendly staff, great rooms, (bathroom needs brightening up a bit) but everything kept very clean. The swimming pools are lovely & pool guys look after you very well. A week wasn't long enough for us to see everything & arrange our wedding so will definately go back and see the friends we made there. we found the food rather good (definately wasn't chips every night) restaurant staff friendly and attentive. My hubby always had his beer chilling in an ice bucket at meal times, this was ready and waiting.... lol. Even the beach sellers were not as bad as we thought....they seem to know everything & are only trying to earn a living. They can't cross over to the hotel and have to stay on the beach as security guards are on duty day & night. The hotel has lovely foiliage in between floors, chipmunks are great & there was monkeys, but didn't get to see them. We both wanted to cry when we had to leave, it's truely a beautiful magical place.",positive
"Loved the hotel, beautiful setting, lovely service, good food, good settings, loved the pool",positive
"This was the best hotel holiday we have ever had - wife and I and son (21) and daughter (18) really appreciated the genuinely friendly and extraordinarily helpful staff. Food was was great in the main restaurant - no need to go to the exclusive restaurant. We were so impressed that we wrote to thank the manager and copied to our tour operator. We have never felt the desire to do that before! We had stayed at two apparently similar hotels elsewhere in Sri Lanka and these were clean and pleasant, but Heritance was simply in a different league altogether. Reception, restaurant and 'games' staff especially helpful",positive
"We stayed beginning of August for 3 nights in the Junior Suite in Heritance Ahungalla. In general, the rooms are clean, the swimming pool is nice, especially for kids and also the beach is great. Unfortunately, like most 5-star hotels in Sri Lanka, also this one lacked essential things like a proper finishing in the room (the bathroom was a desaster, I cut myself several times at the glass door there), a very small TV only etc. The food was good quality, thoug a little expensive, but because we liked it we only ate at the hotel. The breakfast had a wide selection, and there was a big variety at the dinner buffetts, for example ""seafood grill night"" etc. The service was very poor, anything you wanted to do or to get took ages and did not work properly. On one saturday night there was a wedding with extremely loud music next to the second pool (where all the suites are localed; it was like a disco), and with still going on after 11 o´clock and the kids not being able to sleep I complained several times without success. It went on until 3 in the morning, which literally destroyed our next day and is something no 5-star hotel should accept. Many guests complained, but the management rather preferred to cash in the money for the ceremony instead of satisfiying their guests. Nevertheless we had altogether a good time, the animateurs at the hotel were dedicated and we had a lot of fun with waterpolo and beach volleyball. One last note: as generally in Sri Lankan 5 star hotels, they overprice taxis etc. by 300 to 400%. Just go out of the hotel and rent a taxi or tuc-tuc there, as next to the savings the locals know all the places to go.",negative
"The stunning view beach is the only positive memory that we have from our stay. Otherwise the hotel is dated, poorly managed, and many unmaintained facilities. Air conditioning, ceiling fan in our room did not work. The door locks in our room to the bathroom and balcony were broken. Considering that balconies from other rooms are essentially interconnected, there was little or no security from the balcony side of our room. The main restaurant buffet is expensive and of poor cafeteria style food. Very little flair to the food, designed to please those who did not really want to leave home. Entertainment in the lobby at night is essentially Karaoke musicians mouthing CD music. The hotel was built in the 1960s and it seems nothing was done to improve or redecorate the place since it's initial opening. It is a nice visit back to a mid 1960's contemporary architecture that has a seedy ambiance. The staff is friendly and helpful as long as it does not involve complicated activities such as room maintenance, directions to anywhere, or being served coffee in the restaurants. The hotel has no control over the touts in front of the hotel nor at the beach. These touts are of course part of the scenery but makes the guests not want to wander onto the beach since they will not leave visitors alone and will not take no as an answer. It is a sad commentary of Sri Lanka, but the hotel could do more to discourage these parasites.",negative
"We booked this hotel for the second part of our holiday by the coast. We were swayed to book this hotel due to the raging reviews on Trip Advisor. Unfortunately it didn’t quite live up to our expectations, especially after leaving the Cinnamon Lodge in Habarana which was advertised to be a lower rating hotel. Our opinions do differ from those on here. The hotel is well known for the architect and so we expected something quite special, as it was also a ‘5’ star resort. On arrival the Loby is attractive as you can see through to a lush swimming pool right onto the sea. The swimming pools were the best bit of this hotel. They are lovely. However, we did find the hotel lacked character and that holiday feel. The architecture was a bit cold and bleak, very concrete, modern and minimalist. Somewhat like a business Hilton hotel which is just not we want on a holiday. The plants around the hotel seemed tired and a bit dead, just outside our room we overlooked a moulding wall where there used to be vegetation climbing up it. The hotel was all very open which was good for a natural breeze, but as soon as the monsoons came this caused a death trap of slippery hallways bars, seat cushions etc. The hotel rooms were nice, again modern but of good quality. The whole place lacked good lighting though. There was also the natural bare plastered look in the hotel bathrooms etc. Not our taste but might appeal to some. I personally like a bright lick of paint or something it bit more luxurious. The hotel did have good facilities if you wanted tennis, ping pong, badminton, spa’s etc. However going onto the beach was slightly annoying due to the persistent locals selling on the beach who would sit on the beach facing the hotel shouting at you to come and look as they will “give you good price”. This is a little off putting but I understand it’s just the way there. We never managed to go onto the beach without having to say no thanks to several different people. The restaurants and entertainment were the biggest disappointment. The food was always nice (wine expensive) but the restaurants lacked atmosphere. The main restaurant had set menus for most of our stay and these were quite pricey. The buffets in that restaurant were a bit better as at least you got more choice. But the restaurant is dark and dreary. No ambience. The a la carte “Cafe”? did have nice food but a bit limited on choice. You also don’t expect to have your a la carte meal in a cafe which lacked again any sort of luxury and really had the ambience slightly above that of a McDonalds. (I am being slightly harsh). The entertainment at the hotel was pretty poor. Sometimes there was a band singing the same songs every night. A cocktail promotion (doesn’t mean it’s a price promotion) with live demonstration. Or simply someone plays an instrument. It was very quiet during our stay so maybe they do more in the main season. We actually spent many of our nights at the Taj hotel in Bentota after this was recommended to us by fellow guests in the same boat as us. I suggest you go there just to get a comparison of what a 5 star hotel should really be like. We had a Chinese in the restaurant there and it was lovely. There buffet meals also had a great deal more ambience. Just grab a tuk tuk to get there. The Refresh restaurant 20 mins away in Hikkaduwa was also lovely. I recommend you stay in Bentota though if you want choice and to be able to walk out the hotel to more restuarants. There is nothing near the Heritance. Having said all that, if you want a quiet, clean relaxing hotel to just unwind sit by the pool and have early nights then it’s a great option. If you are lucky you will see some black monkeys around the hotel. We did get this hotel at a good price so we can’t complain I just believe the ratings on here are misleading. This is not to discredit the staff at the Heritance who were mostly all very helpful and nice people.",neutral
"We were lured to the Heritance by a ridiculously affordable package deal on Sri Lankan Airways, and I was very pleasantly surprised by the accommodations. Though I wouldn't quite call it 5-star, the place is beautiful and certainly afforded a very relaxing holiday. The one thing that came as a not so pleasant surprise was the cost of food and beverages, which were outrageous. Unless you're very hungry, I would skip the overpriced dinner buffet and stick to the ""coffee shop,"" which is open all day and offers a nice range of foods (sri lankan, chinese, and western) with excellent and very attentive service. The breakfast buffet, which is generally included, was also very nice. The spa is also quite pricey for South Asia, but I really enjoyed my treatment there.",positive
"Overall I would say this is a superb hotel and would definately recommend it to anyone wanting a relaxing place to stay. The hotel is very clean, the rooms are large and spacious and all the staff are very accomodating. The two infinity pools are lovely and the loungers around them can be moved in to the shade very easily or in to the sun when required. As we went off peak it was incredibly quiet and for 3 days there were only 2 couples around the second pool. The beds are very comfortable and the bathrooms well equipped with large showers and always immaculately clean. Breakfast was always very good with a huge range of food, with omlettes freshly cooked to order. Try the Egg Hoppers! Evening meals were available in the main restaurant generally tended to be from a set menu and were always a high standard - although the Sri Lankans tend to put two different dishes on one course. The Coffee Shop was also very good - you have to try Rice an Curry - a real treat. The Negative Points: On two occassions I sent food back only to have the original food returned........ the first was a chicken burger which I specifically requested to have no cheese on, it was returned with cold chips and the cheese scraped off - absolutely disgusting in my book and they were very apologetic about it. However the waiter spilt an orange juice over another plate of food and said he would get a fresh one, but when he returned the food was still soaked with OJ and underneath the salad there were remnants of the juice, so once again the plate had just been wiped down. I understand they were incredibly quiet but keeping costs down at the expense of the guest is not on. At weekends a lot of Sri Lankans tend to come and stay and the hotel becomes incredibly noisy. If you like early nights and peaceful sleeping I would definately recommend you request a room away from the main pool area. We arrived and were put in to a room facing the main pool and just on walking in the room knew it would be too noisy. We could still clearly hear the Fri and Sat night entertainment in our replacement room and Sat night there was really loud music on until midnight. If you value some peace ask for rooms at the far ends of the hotel. A word of warning regarding the beach hawkers...... unfortunately we had a bad experience with Emile De Silva, we arranged a couple of trips and an evening meal at the Sunshine Restaurant. Whilst the trips were 'ok' I felt crowded by having him, a driver and someone else join us (a trick for getting more money out of us by asking for bigger tips), they rushed us around the nice places and didn't really give us any space and didn't deliver on the glass bottomed boat, whilst still wanting the same money. The evening meal also never materialised with 2 different excuses given and then making us walk miles down the beach to another location which was actually on the road. We lost 1000 rupees as we refused to go as they had not told us earlier in the day there was a problem. Otherwise the other people on the beach were great, the ladies selling the 'sari's' were great fun and whilst they did try and call us over all the time they were lovely. Whilst the negative points above need to be considered, please don't let it put you off. The hotel was wonderful and all the staff would fall over themselves to help. It certainly looks by far the most superior hotel on that coastline. We have certainly agreed we will be returning in 2 years time. Tourism in Sri Lanka is desperately needed and when you spend your money you are treated like Kings. Tip: Take a trip to Unawatuna - a stunning little beach outside Galle which was charming and filled with the locals.",positive
"We needed a total escape holiday with complete relaxation and once we got to the Heritance Ahungalla that's exactly what we got. From the moment we arrived, all departments of staff were nothing less than friendly, courteous and helpful, checking our needs were being met at all times, even the boys sweeping the sand/ground maintenance would look up and smile and say hello as you passed by. We had standard rooms booked, a quick email to the hotel before departure to ask for rooms next to each other as we were taking our teenage daughter, prompted an immediate response to assure us that our requirements would be met. The rooms once we got there were next to each other as promised, in a prime location next to the Residents Pool and of an excellent standard. Rooms were attended to twice daily with clean linen and towels. Air conditioning silent. There were always sunbeds available with cushions and plenty of towels, once you'd been by the pool a day, the pool attendant knew how many cushions and towels to bring the next day along with an umbrella and they would be set up ready for you with a smile and a wave from the pool guy! The food was excellent, with choices from The Mustard Cafe, The Jute Restaurant, Fine Dining, the Mirror Bar or room service (which was the most prompt I have ever had - 15 mins!!) it was easy to have completely different things every night. True Sri Lankan food can be very spicy but there was plenty of other choice and on buffet night when they cook the food in front of you, you can opt for no chilli at all should you wish! although personally if you can't take a bit of heat in your food - I wouldn't bother even going to Sri Lanka - you would miss out on so much of the whole experience. Service again was excellent. The pools were gorgeous, beautifully clean although leaves and flowers blew in during the day, the pool guy's fished them out. The hotel can get busy at weekend with Locals coming for the day but there is a designated Residents Pool Only that remains quiet. There are plenty of activities too if you are so inclined, our teenagers found plenty to do. Table tennis, badminton, tennis, horse riding, beach or water volleyball, etc etc. We only had to pay extra for the horse riding. There was entertainment on most nights but depending on where your room was, you might not even have realised it! It was easy to go out for quick trip to the next town in a Tuk Tuk with careful negotiatin of price with the drivers hovering round the gate. You need to be firm though or they get carried away with ideas and want to take you places! They are so proud to show you their country. This hotel is quite a long way from any of the other known tourist sites and would require a long journey (due to the roads not the distance) and overnight stay. We didn't attempt this on this visit but probably will next time. I needed two visits to the spa as one wasn't enough!! lovely lovely lovely! The beach was beautiful but as it was monsoon season the sea was way too rough to swim in, however great fun can be had paddling - i wouldn't take small children in though as some of the waves were unexpectedly deep, the undertow was very strong, a small child could very easily get knocked over and dragged out before you''ve time to react. We didn't suffer with much rain though, what came was mostly at night. We had some cloud but it was a relief in between the searing heat and the little rain showers didn't affect you if you were in the pool - the pools guys just folded up the cushions with your towel/book/sunglasses inside while it passed! There was a constant breeze though which was lovely , if you go out of monsoon season, there is no wind, the sea is apparently like a millpond! Transfer fom Colombo, while only 74km, took over 3 hours due to the lack of roads in Sri Lanka, everybody is filtered onto the same few. The roads are in excellent repair, just very full. This is the perfect time to soak up the atmosphere of Sri Lanka though and the journey passed easily enough (both ways) in an airconditioned vehicle. If you read reviews from some of the other hotels along this route, the A2/Galle Road, you will notice most people mention the railway runs alongside it and can cause distubances at 6am in some cases! This is not the case here as the main road is on the 'sea' side of the line which veers inland a bit in this area. The hotel gates once closed seem to be holding this quiet little paradise inside. No main road traffic or railway noise can be heard in the hotel grounds at any time. Perfectly peaceful! We had the most amazing time at this hotel - there were 3 weddings too which was lovely to watch with the visiting elephant! It was exactly the kind of holiday we needed, a lovely hotel with wonderful staff - it truly was paradise.",positive
"What a great place to relax and recharge the batteries. This hotel is in a fabulous setting with nice grounds. The rooms were a good size with everything you need. Great pool and beachside. The food was good, however the main restaraunt is very dark. Not the best atmosphere. Can recommend the spa facilities, my wife and I loved it. Say hello to Luxman (Lucky), The head pool barman, who will happily look after all your needs from exotic cocktails to lunch time snacks at the pool bar. Overall a great place to stay. A quality hotel from the Aitken Spence group.",positive
"Lovely hotel. On beautiful beach. Recommended by our guide - we were booked in to the Lighthouse but our guide - Karnal De Silva see karnadesilva.com - suggested this would be better since it actually had access directly onto a lovely beach. It was far better. Two great pools. Lovely staff. Clean. Although no restaurants nearby, the hotel restaurants are not at all overpriced. Simply lovely.",positive
"We read all of the guide books and surfed the net before plumping for this hotel having spent the first night at the tired and desperately in need of a refurb Bentota beach resort , great pool sweaty sheets.... only 45 minutes from Galle, which is only worth a day trip any way if you ask me.... If you are looking for a beach side paradise with a modern room with quiet aircon and sliding doors onto a pool that is pure bliss for midnight swims then this cant be faulted. Food is great, plenty of options and places to eat, your room, the terrace, cafe or fine dining. Tennis, Snooker and yoga, not in that order.... We stayed in 5 hotels from Kandy, Nuwara, Dambulla and here. this was the best value and the most excellent. service was fab. Although all heritance hotels are good the one at Dambulla is triple the price for example; for food and beverages. Stay at the earls regeency or mahawali reach in kandy> tea plantation or St andrews in Nuwara Elya and the kandalama in Dambulla, expensive but a truely natural experience, like having a safari in your room! monkeys on the balcony, bats in the corridors and an infinty pool overlooking the wilderness. Snakes and lizards every where, in a nice way! oh and if you want golf the only place to play is the sublime course near Kandy at victoria. a real gem. Enjoy",positive
"I won't add much to all that's been said already. This is a really lovely hotel and we would have been very sad to leave had we not been going on to The Maldives. We spent two weeks in a luxury room but the de-luxe rooms were very nice also. Maybe the standard rooms don't have such a great aspect in some cases but that is normal in ANY hotel. I've stayed in 5 star hotels in various parts of the world and this is probably a four-star by U.K standards but it's superb. So relaxing. I want to say that we went with Rassi [ on the beach ] on a half-day trip by tuk-tuk to the River Safari and the moonstone mine and a garden. It was great fun and very cheap and safe. He's a nice guy and so is Silva [ older man with an umbrella,moustache and hat ] also on the beach. I have Rassi's mobile number if you want it. There are a lot of de Silvas in Sri Lanka, it's of Portugeuse origin but the guide who is mentioned frequently on this site is Rammuni de Silva . We had a wonderful two night tour to Kandy in his very comfy people mover [ lovely reclining seats]. His driver is superb and anything we wanted to do was arranged plus some really nice thoughtful touches. We stopped to eat at authentic 'restaurants' and the food was delicious. Rammuni arranged for us to release turtles, wash elephants and lots more.He even got us cut-price seats at the magnificent perahera. He has so many contacts everywhere and is also good company. I heartily recommend him and have his contact details so just email me. I wish you a wonderful trip.We had a whale of a time [ or should I say turtle].",positive
"I stayed at the Heritance for 3 weeks and I can only praise the Management and all the staff as they are all exceptional people, always smiling and nothing is too much. They really do take care of you and they take great pride in the hotel and there work. The food is outstanding and with great thought and preparation. I would highly recommend a stay at the Heritance. I never thought I would experience the emotions I did on leaving. A very exceptional place and very exceptional staff.",positive
"We travelled to this hotel with Kuoni travel under the idea that it was a 5* luxury hotel. This hotel had all the potential of a good 4* hotel. The beech was amazing the staff were amazing, however there always seemed to be something missing and not quality about the hotel. We stayed at this hotel for 7 nights having travelled around the island for 4-5 days. The poolside service was very good with staff being extremely friendly and chatty. The animator was also a healthy addition to the hotel encouraging water polo and other activates throughout the day. The pool bar offered a nice little lunchtime snack menu however every meal was with French fries and wasn’t the best quality. We recommend sprite as it was half the price of coke or diet coke. The sprite was around 70p and coke was £1.50 for a can. There was also a service charge on each bill so there was no need for tipping and carrying cash as it could all be charged to the room The evening food in the main restaurant under a set menu was very average and was trying to be to clever for its own good. Not much variety if you were a fussy eater and didn’t like fish. The al a carte restaurant (or coffee shop) offered a welcome opportunity to get a square meal. This was available with a 10% discount to half and full board customers. when the hotel got busy at the weekend however the restaurant came alive with a huge Mexican and bbq buffet on the Friday and Saturday nights. The breakfasts were also very good with every possible breakfast such as omelettes and waffles. However, when the weekend did arrive the hotel filled with hundreds of locals. This wasnt a problem until the quiet pool became a holiday at butlans with kids screaming and weeing into the pool. The locals were then extremely rude to the friendly staff making the stay extremely uncomfortable as you had to witness this behaviour. The staff were being shouted at and fingers clicked at with no manners. It was clear that the other guests felt the same through conversations in the lobby. The evening buffet at the weekend although it had good food resembled a school canteen. At 9 oclock families were bringing there young screaming children to dinner. Those children who were not dead on there feet at this time were runing around bumping in to the staff and other guests. This un civilised behaviour caused some couples to leave in disgust. The room was very good although we were continually being pested by staff asking if the room was ok. Also the wiring of the room was questionable with switches for different lights being in the wrong place. The beech was a no go area also as you were trying to have a romantic walk along the beech and were surrounded by peopel trying to sell you trips and clothing. Even when you were trying to sun bathe there was a constant noise coming from the beech of people trying to grab your attention. As a result of this I would not recommend this hotel to anyone I liked. I will also be informing Kuoni of the hotel at the weekend.",neutral
"What can I say about The Heritance that hasn't already been said except don't take my word for it, just go and sample it yourself. Everything, - rooms, staff, food, location - is absolutely fantastic and I'll certainly return. We've stayed previously in Sri Lanka at The Taj Exotica and although that was nice The Heritance has the edge. We stayed in room 353, which had superb uninterrupted views over the quiet infinity pool and the ocean. It had everything we needed and was kept beautifully clean by the room boys. Excellent value for money was dining in the Jute Restaurant and although the chef did provide two main courses on one plate, if you asked for just one meat they happilly provided it. Breakfast was again wonderful - even bacon and sausages were cooked to order, not left on a hot plate for goodness how long. The only thing I would disagree with other reviewers is the hassle from the beach sellers. They really are no problem at all and, let's face it, spending a few rupees on a sarong is hardly going to break the bank but gives a much needed income to people desperately in need of such. Silva, who patrols the beach, knows everything you need to know and is the loveliest person you could ever wish to meet - so don't be afraid to stop and have a chat with him, you'll be pleasantly surprised, believe me. Don't forget, you're in Sri Lanka and the people are honest and there to serve you. There's also a lovely shack at the end of the beach called the Sunshine Restaurant (its original building, which was beautiful, was unfortunately destroyed in the tsunami) and if you want an excellent cheap lunch time or evening meal then go there. The fish is freshly caught that day, it's beautifully presented and tastes delicious. It;s also spotless. Anyone looking for a good guide should contact D. Karnal de Silva ([--] - tel. [--]). He was recommended by a number of people and we arranged for him and his driver, Sampath to take us from the airport to the Heritance. So impressed were we by his knowledge, excellent English and his driver's safe driving that we booked him to take us to Yala, a three day trip which was the most enlightening trip we have ever had. I can highly recommend him and you will, I am sjure, be every bit as delighted as we were to meet him,. In conclusion, go to The Heritance, enjoy it every much as we did and, of course, Sri Lanka, a beautiful country.",positive
"I stayed at heritance on 4th June with my spouse for our honeymoon. i knew its going to be a nice stay and it was indeed nicer than i expected. Location is fantastic. View is heavenly. Staff is soo nice and friendly. SARA was exceptional---Hi Sara!!! Food is good and the room was clean and spaceious. my room was room number 207-Delux, will go back there again soon. simply we are happy and cherish every moment we spent in Heritance.",positive
"Just back from amaizing and relaxing trip from Sri Lanka. (4-12.Jun) Positive: exellent service, outstanding food and choice, great value, clean ,frendly staff, great facilties (gym, two outdoor pools, jacuzi, game rooms, libary, internet, two bars, night club, two shops, bussines center, SPA). If you travel by BB package its great to dining in restorans(cheap, around £10) , drinks in the bar £ 4,50 and beer £ 2. It is amaizing hotel. Negative: locals around you on the beach, sundflys, some jelly-fish (but this is nothing to do with hotel) Perfect place and destination for getting away from everything. Ideal for couples and singles. This is not destination who wants active nightlife, animators, screaming childern,lots of tourists and entertaiment, shopping and etc. Recomendation: if you are sensitive person...don't step out from hotel, because locals are very active for selling everything . I guess this is affect after very low tourism level in country. Im surprised, because its great holiday destination. If you decide to travel around, go for two day trip to Kandy, tea plantations, factory and waterfalls...its worth. Buy individual trips from local (sertificated) travel agents, Because holiday providers sale double price for same thing. Two day trip pp around £70(incl tickets, car, driver, petrol, guide) plus hotel expensses.(My choice was Thilanka in Kandy, because great value and location, but I recommend stay in Tea Factory or Earls Regency) You can choice and book you hotel or ask to do the guide. Make sure where ever you go, keep in pocket tips, because this system are in all places. Sometimes you can feel uncomfortable. I spent almost £40 in thistradition for 7 days.(You can keep in walet 100 rupies notes and this is ok for everything)",positive
"Ok so after arriving from a long 11/12 Hour flight from UK the 3 hour transfer to the hotel was not an experience I was looking forward to the traffic was very bad and seemed to take a life time. We had our own private car transfer and I would advise anyone staying to do the same to make the journey more bareable. Upon arrival it was evident the journey had been well worth it the architecture and landscape is truely breath taking. We recieved a warm friendly welcome and was wisked off to the bar for a welcome drink while our luggage was taken to our room. We were shown to our room and the staff member talked us through how to use the air con and the facilities available. As soon as the staff member left my partner and I burst out laughing as we couldn't believe how lucky we were. The room was amazing with stunning Ocean views and the main infinity pool from our balcony. The room is finished to a very high standard, immaculatley clean. Well stocked mini bar (not complimentary), fridge, air con and cieling fan, safe, plenty of storage for clothes, TV, Phone, complimentary water (replenished daily) and a welcome cake. The bathroom had ample towels which were changed twice daily (bare this in mind if you like us to have a nap in the early eve before dinner to put you do not disturb sign on the door so they dont disturb you while your sleeping) complimentary toiletries -shampoo, shower gel and body lotion. Our room had a huge rain shower (room for 2 or even 3 people hehe) I noted there was also a hair dryer but can't say either of us used it. Food-Breakfast was the biggest breakfast buffet I have ever seen it was nice to be able to to sample a Sri Lankan breakfast but no fear if thats not your thing there is much more a wide range of breads, cakes and pasteries, cold meats, cheese, salad, everything for a cooked English breakfast and chefs cooking omelettes, waffles, pancakes and fresh fruit/juice theatre style. (we never felt the need to eat lunch after that lot) We ate dinner in the Mustard Coffee shop on the first night the Lobster was very nice! We had dinner in the main Jute retaurant restaurant for the rest of our stay which was a set menu most evenings about 7 courses, canape, 3 starters usually small bite size of each (served at same time) 2 soups (small cups served at same time) a sorbet then you had a choice of mains which was usually a meat dish a fish/seafood dish and vegetarian option you then had a choice of desserts followed by fresh Ceylon tea or coffee they also had 2 BBQ themed evenings during our stay spoilt for choice for meats and fresh seafoods salads and desserts other hot non BBQ dishes were also available on the buffet such as currys and pasta dishes the cost was 2500 rupees (per person for both the set dinner and BBQ roughly £13) which we thought was really good value. The food was always excecuted and presented extremley well although maybe one or two too many components on a plate at the same time (but this is probably my chefy foodie head on) each component tasted great and thats what matters. Drinks- we stuck to drinking the local 'lion' beer for most of our trip (served with a glass that had been stored in the freezer to ensure its stayes nice and cold which was a nice touch) which was 320 rupees (£1.70 a pint size bottle) we was shown an extensive wine list that had lots of famliar names I think the cheapest started around £12. We drunk our way through the cocktail menu on the last night all very nice particularly their own Heritance cocktail (cant remember exact name i had hade a few by then) made with the local Arak and all the classics are also available all 800 rupees (roughly £4.50) we was treated to complimentary canapes and homemade crisps as we enjoyed our drinks service at the bar and restaurant was always great. Facilities - 2 Huge Infinity pools we was lucky the hotel was not busy the only people in them most days the pool attendents were very friendly and sufficent, i noted a tennis court, volly ball net, snooker room, games room although didn't use them so not sure if they have the equipment or you need to bring your own? There internet access in the Library on the second floor it was just over £1 for an hour you have to get a card from the reception. Theres a night club on site we popped in briefly but as the hotel was quiet we was the only people in there and wasn't quite the same raving on ya own haha. Music from the club was well contained so not fear of being woken up by music in your room. There is a Spa but was a bit to pricey for us. There is a well equiped gym that is free to guests. We took a tuk tuk (300 rupees roughly £1.60 return) down the road to the turtle hatchery 1000 rupees PP entrance donation (£5.50) we went around 3pm we was advised the best time to go is around 5/6pm you might then be able to takes some turtles back to the sea (we didnt want wait around that long) still an enjoyable experience either way. The weather was perfect (June 4th-12th 2009) cloudy most days but hot (hot enough to get a tan or burnt in my case) with a nice sea breeze the odd down pour usually in the afternoon but it stops and dry out again real quick didnt bother us at all the sea unfortunately was to rough for a propper swim but was ok for a paddle my partner also go a mild sting from a jelly fish so that put us off going in again. As other people have said in their reviews hawkers (lookie lookie men/woman) are a real hassel on the beach and surrounding area we walked to the local shop to try and buy Cigarettes (you cant bring any in duty free without paying goverment tax) and we were swamped with people trying to talk to us takes us places make us go to shops following us it was a bit overwhelming and i didn't feel particularly safe having so many people around me we didnt leave the hotel on foot again after that. Also many a quiet morning walk on the beach would be spoilt I saw one couple get surrounded by 8 people this is something the resort have no control other however they do have security guards on the beach preventing them entering so no hassel in the resort complex. So an amazing stay! Definatley want to go back.",neutral
"We have lived in Sri Lanka for a while; hence choosing it for a holiday seemed so perfect. We had only one objective on this holiday- to soak in as much of Sri Lanka as we could – in terms of Sun, sand and Sambol (a fiery chutney made in Sri Lanka) since we are big Sri Lankan foodies. We had heard of Heritance through some friends and also looked it up on the Internet and we decided to try it out. We reached Heritance late afternoon after spending a day in Colombo with friends. As soon as we reached the place, we knew we had made the right choice. Upon entering, we saw a vast expanse of the pool shaded by the beautiful and fragrant frangipani trees and the sea loomed in the horizon beyond.. It was a perfect setting. The Hotel was originally designed by the renowned architect Geoffrey Bawa and is large, airy with trees everywhere. The decor is contemporary yet elegant. Although all the interiors are not completely Bawa, its overall pleasing. The trees and the landscape are beautiful to look. It adds a sense of calmness to the ambience. The hotel is quite spacious and there was a fair amount of walking to do within the corridors but we didn’t mind that at all. We were swiftly taken to our room, we chose a suite.. We wanted a relaxed holiday … we were staying for 6 nights... we wanted a home away from home The suite was large, spacious and faced another pool and the Indian Ocean. The hotel boasts of 2 main restaurants, a gym, a bar, a fine dinning, pool table and games, library, 2 pools, tennis, cycling and a nice spa…something for everyone!! We spent the next 6 days next to the pool in a wonderful reclined position eating, drinking and swimming at intervals. Although the hotel was quite full at that time, the staff managed everyone very nicely. The queues were never long, the food was always ample and the staff was ready to serve with a smile. The food was always a choice between Sri Lankan and continental. Since we love Sri Lankan food, it suited us perfectly. The Breakfast was a very good buffet with loads of salads, continental, Sri Lankan and even Indian on certain days. The food overall was plenty and marvelous. The hotel staff was exceptional. In fact if you were traveling with children, I would recommend it strongly. The hotel staff was very generous and helpful with our 2.8 year old and whipped up new dishes only for her and offered it free of charge.. Everyone was very warm and very helpful. The hotel arranged cultural programs but we didn’t see any, as we were busy relaxing if that makes any sense. But I did try the water aerobics organized every morning and I have to admit, I loved it!! I also tried the spa and found it very satisfactory. The thing I loved the most about this hotel was the area around the pool, I would sip my drink under the beautiful frangipani and watch the sun go down… the evenings were just exceptionally lovely. The holiday overall was everything we could hope for and more. As I said earlier we wanted to soak in as much of the Sun, sand and sambol as we could manage and I think we did. The Holiday had been … well… Simply Sri Lankan..",positive
"Our stay at the Heritance was memorable. This is a fantastically designed hotel by Sri Lanka's legendary architect Geoffery Bawa. In keeping with his style, the hotel is open to the elements - there is an uninterrupted vista of the sea from the vast, uncluttered lobby with sea breeze blowing in at all times... when the breeze is a little rough, of course, papers, hair, clothes - all go flying up, up and away! The rooms were spacious with views of the sea and well appointed with all mod cons. Two large swimming pools meant you never had to fight for space. The staff was extremely courteous and attentive. Food was uniformly good. The hotel is also a good take off point for Galle and other Southern destinations. LOVED the place and have every intention of returning.",positive
"Having read some fantastic reviews of this hotel, we arrived with high expectations. Twice prior to arrival we had reqested a room with a sea view and a double bed. On arrival however we were asked if we wanted to upgrade before even seeing the room, therefore, it came as no suprise that we had neither a sea view nor a double bed as requested. Now I appreciate the hotel was very busy over the Sri Lankan New Year however we had booked well in advance and were assured that within two days we would be moved, which did not materialise despite constant pleas, until day 7 of 10! Agreed the hotel was very clean and in a fantastic location, however, if you are looking for something intimate and romantic this is not the place for you. The beach is beautiful though the hawkers provide little peace and are a constant menace and not to be trusted, given the stories we heard from trusted locals inland.",negative
"I'm easily intimidated by 'posh' places but despite this being the classiest hotel I've seen- decor and architecture superb- it was relaxed and friendly. Staff were quietly efficient and helpful but equally happy to chat, or join in ping-pong etc. Pools huge, clean, stunning.Food wonderful-breakfast was incredible- included local dishes as well as everything the fussiest eater could want. Award winning chef knows his stuff. Don't worry about the tuktuk / beach touts- just be friendly but firm if you don't want a tour/tuktuk ride/guide/sarong etc. Anyway you can get better trp deals with them than the (admittedly extortionate) prices the hotel charges. Our favourite 'guide' was N.Wilma de Silva [--]- very cheery chap and good fun. Hotel was near deserted towards end of our 10 day stay as it was v hot- near monsoon. But apparently monsoon rains are intermittent- might consider going there then. Do support the local businesses as they're still building up after the tsunami-shack at the end of the beach serves excellent freshly fished prawns/lobster; new souvenir shop about 1km from hotel is great- the owner came to UK & worked as a cleaner in Woollies for years to build up capital- great bloke. Great holiday of a lifetime. Well worth the money (but we did have a great deal through thomas cook).",positive
"We visited Heritence Ahungalle for 2 nights in mid-April 2009. This was our second trip to the property having visited 5 years ago on our last trip to SL. Booked directly through the hotel website after comparing other similar properties such as Taj Exotica Bentota, The Fortress, Galle Fort Hotel and Eden Resort. Chose the Heritence given we had a wonderful stay 5 years ago. I wrote to the hotel inquiring about rates and was promised a free upgrade to a luxury room given that I was a returning guest. The hotel also stated that the property has been completely refurbished hence the drastic increase in price. When I got to the Heritence, I was told I would be given a deluxe room (the most basic room). I advised that I was promised a free upgrade to which I was told that they cannot honour this promise. They then advised that I could have an upgrade to a luxury room for an additional cost of Rs. 10,000 (US$86) per night. Given the higher cost I declined the upgrade and was quite disappointed. I had also requested a cot for my infant son when the booking was made. When I got to the hotel I was told that all the cots were in use. I complained to the General Manager who promised to look into it and get back to me, which he never did. We could not notice the refurbishments made to the property. The room we had looked very similar to the room we had five years ago as did the common areas. The property itself is beautifully maintained and is set on a stunning section of beach in SL. The main infinity pool and lobby area are very beautiful. The food is exceptional with a wide variety of choice all of which are of a very high level of quality. We visited this hotel during the Sri Lankan New Year and the hotel was full of local guests. We were blown away by the property and service on our last visit and were disappointed in the level of service during this trip (the GM has changed once during the past 5 years). I would say that we did have a good time and enjoyed the pool but would not likely return on our next trip to SL given they did not follow through on their promises.",negative
"We stayed here for a week before moving onto the Maldives for our honeymoon. The journey to the hotel was long, but the driver was fine and pointed out sights when we passed them. Pulling into the hotel we were certainly impressed, the reception is spacious, the infinity pool is certainly a show stopper. The staff were couterous and knew that we would be tired so they processed us quickly and efficiently. The room of at the hotel was lovely, we didn't have a bath and that would be the only thing we missed... however saying that a bath is not essential and the shower was powerful and was more like a wet room :) The staff were so considerate and they were so efficient. They jumped to your every need and nothing was too much. We were half board, and the prices I would say was a little more than I anticipated for Sri Lanka however I would not say it was expensive. The food itself was yummy... at the buffet there was much variety, the lunch menu at the pool did gorgeous sandwiches, and the curries in the resturant was lovely... never tasted such gorgeous curries before! The beach was lovely, just there was sellars on the beach but they didn't bother us. We just said no and they left us alone. I would not say they interfered with the relaxed atmosphere at the hotel. We went to Sri Lanka to see Sri Lanka before we would have 10 nights of pure relaxation in the Maldives... this hotel is not ideal for touring or if you want to see the sights. Therefore we decided to do a two day tour and then extended that to a three days so we didn't have to do the 4 hour drive back to the hotel to then have to do the 4 hour journey the next day to go back to the airport. We went and saw Sigira... very impressive... and certainly worth a visit, Kandy - we saw the Kandian dancers... and saw the palace.... so beautiful and highly recommended. We Also saw the elephant orphange and the driver under our request took us to a elephant ride in front of Sigira. The sights of seeing the castle in the back ground whilst on an elephant is a moment I will never forget. I can't fault this hotel... the staff were lovely and the hotel itself was beautiful. If you have done a tour of sri lanka and want a hotel for the end of the tour I would recommend this hotel hands down, if you want a hotel that you just sunbathe and unwind then this is it... however if you want to tour sri lanka and visit Kandy, Sigiria or Galle then this hotel is too far out really. It takes about 3 hours to get anywhere which if you are there for a week or so and then use the days to do a 6 hour round trip then that is not ideal.",positive
"Beautifully designed hotel. An open design so that there is maximum light and air. The pools are lovely and my room had a beautiful sea view. It is however, extremely quiet and quite far from colombo. There is also unfortunately no spa. The food and service were also good.",positive
"Just returned from a memorable 10 Night stay at the Heritance. We originally booked a luxury room but were disappointed with the small bathroom and location. As the hotel was full had to spend first night in there but next day upgraded to a de-lux room with bath and shower which was much larger and in a better, quieter location with superb sea view. The room was kept well cleaned and topped up. The pools are warm, clean and were never overcrowded. Particually liked the hotel location on a long sandy beach with the warm sea water and whilst the sea was too rough for proper swimming some days, it was fine for a splash around in the waves, on a couple of days I hired a body board (200 rupees) which was fun. We also enjoyed many early morning or late afternoon ‘wombles’ along the waters edge sometimes accompanied by a local dog or two who kept us amused chasing birds and crabs. We stayed on half board, the breakfast and evening buffets were excellent with a good choice of both local and international food. Some evenings the buffet menu was themed with a grill night, chinese or local theme which gave a good variety. We had a few lunches at the hotel which worked out around £12 for 2 including drinks, so as advised on the forum, full board is not really worth while. There are several other options for dining in the hotel but you only get a 15% discount at those if you are on half board. The staff at the Heritance are helpful, friendly and go out of their way to make you feel welcome and all seem very proud to work there. The beach touts were no worse than other places we’ve visited in Sri Lanka and India but appreciate they can be a problem especially if you have not encountered them before. We generally exchanged some banter and a hand shake with them and unless we wanted to sort a trip out they would leave us alone. We did a couple of riverboat trips with Ajith who we found really helpful. Also went to the Lucky Lanka Spice and Herb Garden (a couple of minutes down the road from the hotel towards Gaulle) where you can get a herbal balm massage for 1500 Rupees, great for aches and creaky joints! We certainly enjoyed our stay here and will return again.",positive
"We came from France and loved all the country;We went to heritance Ahnugalla last february with two children 12 and 15; beautiful hotel and very nice staff, but much expensive food and services ; let suggest you search on the beach for Fredi (freditour:; contact is also at [--]), very nice guy who can organize everything for you: food, grilled fish on the beach, trips,diving, transfers...at very good prices and he is a very nice person; we enjoyed a lot staying there during the holiday and made a lot of trips around with him; just ask for Fredi and be sure you have to deal with him....you wont regret it!",positive
"Another Aitken Spence hotel, very minimalist, white painted, long corridors with one simple table and mirror. Beautiful approach along a long driveway with open reception and a view of the sea across the infinity pool. The room was average size for a beach hotel but the bathroom was tiny with no bath, just a shower. We had the biggest balcony ever, it ran around the side of the building and had fabulous views of the sea and pool. The staff were fantastic, they couldn't do enough for you, but then the hotel was nowhere near full and they often stood around wanting to do something. The food was excellent but rather expensive. My husband thought he'd paid off the national debt when he got the bill at the end of a weeks holiday. There is nowhere else to go as the hotel stands on its own. There was a beach bar about 100 yards away up the beach for day time use but you had to run the touts and beach boys/girls to get there. I know the hotel have no control over the touts and beach boys but they did spoil the holiday. We couldn't even go for a walk down the beach without someone attaching themselves to us trying to sell us something - coconut, pineapples, hats, sarongs, trips, etc. Would I recommend this hotel to a friend? Yes if they wanted to get away from everything and have a beautiful beach. No if they wanted to be in the heart of things. This hotel is 3.5 hours away from the airport and with a 3 hour check in for international flights we had done a day's work before we even got on the plane. There are no shops to speak of on the road, only a local wine shack to buy Arak and a tiny 'supermarket'. We did feel rather isolated and ended up walking the hotel corridors as there is nowhere to go!",positive
"My husband and i stayed here for only 4 nights as part of our very own tour. It seems allot of people stay here for 1 to 2 weeks. The hotel entrance will bring a smile to your face and it really sets out to be luxurious. We opted to upgrade ourselves to a sea view suite and were really impressed with the huge bed, the huge bathroom, the lounge and our own balcony with sunloungers. it was a real treat. Food at the hotel is mainly the buffet option which is very good value for money and the food is also very good. They had a set menu one night which we found to be a little mean on the portions, but maybe we eat allot! Room service is also very very good food. Having stayed at the Kandalama property we found service not to be of as high a quality and it was bit of a nuisance to have to hunt down a pool attendant so you could get a sun lounger. Positives Great location, great view, fantastic suite, lovely food Negatives This of course is personal, but we felt quite strongly about these points, so we have added them ... Other guests at the hotel were buying from the beach hawkers who would shout to get your attention. Why do this, it ruins the serentity for your fellow guests! Dont be so lazy, get out of the resort if you are there for 2 weeks and see some sites!. Plus you wouldnt have a man on the beach with a monkey chained to him so you can have your photo taken! i think if you come here for a package of 1-2 weeks and you enjoy tanning all day and not really seeing Sri Lanka then you will enjoy it here. Had we not upgraded i dont think i would have really liked this hotel. Maybe find something smaller and more intimate",positive
"Sri Lanka was one of the places we wanted to include on our vacation as we were highly really excited about viisting this place. We have heard both good and bad about the country.However,looking at the picturesque locations of Sri Lanka gave us the boost to visit the place. We decided to book the hotels on-line which gave us the opportunity to directly deal with the hotel rather than going through a third party. We were assisted with all the questions we had and we got exactly what we were told by the Colombo Head office. Finally after we got all the matters clarified,we proceeded with our on-line reservation by only paying a 25% deposit through our credit card. Heritance Ahungalla was our selection to spend our seven day vacation as it was known as the best five star beach resort in Sri Lanka. The Two and half hour ride on a Sunday morning was ok after a long flight from UK as our driver sent from the hotel was very friendly and helpful. The warm welcome received with a flower garland indeed made you feel welcomed. Just after ten minutes of arrival we were taken to our wonderful Luxury room facing the marvellous Indian Ocean. The friendly staff,the good service,the delicious meals served in various restaurants and the beautiful swimming pool stretched to the lobby indeed made the hotel a place you should be. After spending three days in Ahungalla sunbathing and relaxing we decided to explore more of the country by visiting the hotel's sister hotels in Nuwara Eliya and Kandy. We followed the same way of booking these hotel also through the web since we were expecting the same good service from the other hotels as well. We decided to book two nights in Tea Factory,Nuwara Eliya and two nights in Earl's Regency,Kandy to stop over to and from our drive to Tea Factory. Each and every hotel had its unique beauty and excellent service to be extended to different travellers. Learning the process of tea making,early morning walks around the beautiful garden, unique dinning experience on the railway carriage and relaxing treatments in the Six Senses Spa made our holiday unforgettable in Tea Factory. The Natural rock junior Suite in Earl's Regency made us book the same room on both our visits. The beautiful view of the misty mountains and river made you relax and enjoy the beauty of nature. Overall it was a great experience staying with Aitken Spence Hotels and value for what you pay and made us want to visit Sri Lanka again. I recommend any traveller to go through the Aitken Spence Hotels web page to know more details about Heritance Kandalama which I was unable to visit as many advise mean that you experience a uniqueness in this property.",positive
"I liked hotel very much. It is very clean, situated in a nice place, warm ocean, good meal, friendly staff (1$ makes unbelievable things :))) ) , I was staying here from the end of february till 12 march. Now its rainy time, so the best time to go here is december - february. Girls on the beach (those who sell different [--]) and beach boys at the begging annoyed quite much, but as your sunbake is becoming more dark - attention from the boys and girls on the beach normalizes. mainly people from poland, germany, england and local guests. Also there were periodically russians that are very energetic :) Almost all geuests are over the hill (over 40), so i was in trouble to find nice chicks (20+) to comunicate :))) Used the help of Kamal (tuk-tuk guy), very nice and friendly man!!! Reccomending him!!! So concluding - staying was very nice!",positive
"We absolutely love this hotel. The grounds are beautiful, it has amazing pools! The rooms are fab, the standard rooms are amazing and the deluxe rooms even better! We had our wedding here right on the beach. The hotel staff were fantastic and treated us like VIPs throughout. They are very attentive and helpful. The food is amazing and lots of choice. They have recently opened a spa there, which is an added bonus but I think it still needs some time to get going. Love this hotel so much and will go back everytime I return to Sri Lanka!",positive
"we were booked here for 6 nights after our round-the-island tour. This hotel was selected as it was the one being pushed by the major tour operator (to whom we have sent a full and damning report) and, at the time of booking the reports on this site were good, although these have now changed. To be fair, we WERE tired after travelling all day. Reception seemed ok until you raised your eyes sea-ward and saw the lager-swilling, chain-smoking and tattooed ""guests"" and the dirty looking swimming pool with broken sunbeds (covered with filthy mattresses) Need I go on? We checked out to the Taj Exotica which for a few pounds more per night was first class I should say that Heritance is about 20 minutes south of Bentota, so not exactly close to anything to allow you to escape",negative
"Good hotel with a great pool and also on the beach. Rooms are spacious and clean but a bit tired in places, the sunbed cushions have also seen better days. Service was very slow, when it happened at all, and therefore would not consider the hotel to be 5 star, more like 4. Food was average and again, you had to ask for things at least three times before you had a hope of getting them. People hang around the edge of the hotel on the beach trying to sell you anything they can and you need to pass them to get to the beach/sea each time, the beach and hotel also have a lot of stray dogs wandering around. A good stay as we were here for a wedding, but definitely not 5 star standard.",positive
"We stayed at the Heritance in February for one week for our wedding and my parents stayed there for a further week whilst we were on our honeymoon in the Maldives! I do not have one bad word to say about the Heritance - Ideally my rating would be 4.5 out of 5 but don't know how to do that!!!! From the moment we arrived we were made to feel truly special, welcome drink, cooling face-cloth, a flower necklace (as we were a 'wedding couple') and a chilled easy check-in. Our room was large and spacious with a glimpse of the sea and the 2nd pool and the bathroom was huge and the shower was good - much needed after the very long flight and 3.5 hour transfer!!!!! Towels in room changed twuice daily if you wanted and most evenings someone came round to the rooms with canapes - bliss! The staff make the hotel they really do - they are so warm, friendly and lovely and do everything they can to make you feel comfortable and relaxed - from the pool guys (my mums 'demands' as it were for sunbeds in a particular place, matresses and towels were met with smiles, jokes and laid out every morning for them - more than I'd have done LOL), to the bar staff (lovely) to the restaurant staff (just as lovely) to the absolutely fantastic wedding co-ordinator(s) - you really couldn't ask for more! Our wedding day with beach back drop was magical, the bestest day ever and went beyound my dreams for how fab and special they made it for us. From start to finish it was perfect, the ceremony was beautiful and the meal in the evening on the beach was gorgeous and the food 5* ala carte yum!!!! I really would recommend marrying there - it was amazing!!!!! Food at the Heritance is really good - it was a shame we were getting married and I had to be semi good as otherwise I think I would have let loose quite happily and out on loads haha! We were HB and didn't really need to have lunch, so didn't feel we had missed out too much but would recommend HB or FB as there is not many places to go outside the hotel for meals that are of a good standard and meals can be expensive if only BB. We just did one boat trip while were there which was part of our wedding package and I would reommend that thoroughly, had we been there for longer I would have loved to have done the overnight trip to the Elephant Orphanage and Kandy but we didn't have time. My parents did do trips out and would highly recommend the Turtle Hatchery over things like going to Galle for the day etc. The only thing negative I could say about Heritance is the sellers on the beach - they stand right outside the hotel beach front on the 'Government owned / public' bit of the beach constantly waving / calling to try and get your attention and you can't go onto the beach without them hassling you - which is a shame as the stretch of beach the Heritance is on is stunning (though the tide is way to rough to swim - which is another shame!!) BUT all this is out of the Heritance's control which is why only 4.5 out of 5 rather than 5 as I am being a bit mean and picky :-) They now have a spa and horse riding as extra activities - I used the spa and the girls are lovely but didn't try the horse riding but it looked fun and they let the horses graze at breakfast time and if you're sat outside they come to your table for a nose - which is really fun and lovely (if you like that sort of thing). We loved it there and will go back - other holiday makers there are regulars each year for anniversaries - so that says something :-) Will be adding pictures when can work out how to do it!!!!!",positive
"We stayed at the Heritance recently to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary (we married there when it was the Triton hotel) and had a fantastic time. Our impressions of the hotel don't seem to quite tie in with other reviewers on this site! We booked everything independently and Sumaya who handled our reservation was very helpful, friendly, professional and efficient. Sadly the airport pick-up that we booked with them never materialised but we were easily able to find a great taxi-driver at the airport who charged much less than the hotel had quoted and although it is a long transfer the standard of driving was excellent (much better than we are used to at home!). The meet and greet at the hotel was very good; welcome drink on arrival and then shown to the restaurant for lunch. We booked on a FB basis so all our meals were taken in the Jute Restaurant and the food and service were always excellent; Sunhil who seemed to be serving us most of the time was great. Breakfast, lunch and dinner was always plentiful with enough variety to keep everyone happy and the standard of the meals was always excellent. Our room and the hotel in general was spotlessly clean and all of the staff very helpful and polite. The beach is fantastic although sadly the sea was always too rough to swim in but the pools more than make up for that. The wooden sun-beds do exactly what they're meant to ... give you somewhere with a fantastic view to relax and watch the amazing sunsets. Yes, there are a lot of hawkers on the beach and they can be a pain but if you're firm and polite with them then they will back off and they're only trying to earn a few rupees anyway. As for the entertainment; well, do you really need it? You have a fantastic place in which to relax and do nothing - it's entertainment enough to watch the sunrise and sunset and listen to the waves. Certainly as a place to unwind the hotel is great and its very easy to simply get a tuk-tuk from outside the hotel and just go off and explore. Further afield there is much to see ... Sigiriya, Kandy etc., and nearby the Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery is definately worth a visit. All in all if you want a relaxing time with good service, great food and lovely scenery - it makes a great place for a holiday.",positive
"We stayed at the Heritance Ahungalla over Christmas and New Year 2008. Firstly when you reach Sri Lanka you are greated by a driver to take you the 3 hours down to the hotel, i would suggest closing your eyes and trying to forget that you are most likely to be on the wrong side of the road, doing a multiple overtaking manouver. If you can get your head around the driving style then you will be able to enjoy the view out of the window to entertain your journey. Once we arrived we were greated by very friendly staff who took us to the bar for a well desreved refreshment. We enquired about upgrading our rooms before our bags were taken to the allocated ones, and they were more than happy to show us what they had available. I would advise that you do this and see more than one because as we found out, some that say they are a sea view have huge trees right infront of the balcony, hence no view. We found a lovely room over looking the main infinity pool and sea. I would say that after my husband viewed a couple of upgrade rooms, its not worth the money, unless your planning on being in your room for most of your holiday! We found that the restaurants are not very varied in choice and not at all to the standard that we would expect, so after a couple of days we were desperate to get out of the hotel and find somewhere else to eat. We ended up in Bentota which is half an hour away by car and Hickadua which is also half an hour away, 1 hour round trip at the closest to eat outside of the hotel was not ideal! so only did a couple of times. This is something to bear in mind also when you stay here, if you are told a trip/meal/room service etc will be a certain amount of time, be sure to add on at LEAST an hour to journeys and about half an hour for the rest. This became abit of an issue in regards to food and drinks for us especially on occasions when the food was of poor standard when it did finally arrive. We decided not to stay for the galla dinner on New Years Eve so we booked a trip to Uda Walawe National Park for an overnight stay which we booked independantly with eco tours. The journey there we were told would take three hours, five hours later we finally arrived!! We were not dissapointed though, well worth a trip if you can stomach the journey. The staff were absolutely fantastic, full of information on the wildlife, and couldnt do enough for us back at camp. They even put up balloons and made us a cake for New Years Eve dinner under the stars! We were dissapointed with the standard of cleanliness around temples and the big buhdda, they could do alot more to improve the rubbish everywhere really (including the world heritage site in Galle!) We did take into account that the tsunami hit hard on the south east coast of Sri Lanka, and that locals are trying their hardest to get back on their feet, but even a member of staff at the hotel admitted that there is one price for locals, and a much higher price for tourist, which we were more than aware of and didnt appreciate. The Hotel was very clean over all and the staff very friendly. If you dont like being hassled whilst sun bathing then try and stay back from the beach as the beach sellers are very persistant and will not take no for an answer, we found that if you tell them you are leaving the next day they back off abit. I would say that if we travelled to Sri Lanka again then we would most likely stay at this hotel again, but not for our whole stay as it would be better to travel around the island to get the most of your stay there.",positive
"Kuoni rate this hotel as 4.5 stars...uhhhmm im not convinced.. First impressions are good as it has a stunning entrance, palm trees, flood lit pond and a huge lobby. Walking through the lobby you are presented with the main pool and wooden boat, stunning at sunset. Rooms: The couple we travelled with got a great room overlooking the pool and beach, we were given a dark corner terrace room overlooking a tree (I would recommend requesting a sea facing room if possible), we were not best pleased so ended up looking at some other rooms until we found one that warranted the sea view we were after. Admittedly they did their best to please. The rooms are nice, very comfortable with a tasteful Indonesian/Asian theme, air con, rain shower, some English TV Channels. Food: I would say average, certainly not 4/5 star. A lot of luke warm food served and as mentioned in other posts food is at 4/5 star prices. Breakfast was a good spread buffet but the other restaurants in resort became painful by the end of the holiday due to poor food and service. Service: I forget exactly how many times we asked twice/three times for our food. One ‘in room dining experience’ left us with a beef burger without beef in it? This isn’t aimed at all of the staff, some of them are exceptional (eg: Rukmal the Bar Captain and the drinks guys) but generally within the restaurants the pace is slow and not very alert. On our last day 1 waiter was serving the entire pool area and yet 6 staff were behind the reception desk doing what exactly!?! I also felt, as have others that they were constantly after a tip (this is generally the rule of thumb in and out of the hotel) Entertainment: Most nights was Piano/live music, pretty bland and not much to do with Sri Lanka. Our last night was a Sri Lankan theme night which was enjoyable with Sinhalese dancers, why they don't do more of this I don't know. The Hotel: Im sure after its refurbishment it looked fantastic but It looks tired in places, the eves of the main building look tired and need a paint, the grounds are ok, sports facilities are good, tennis, ping pong, badmington, gym, beach volley ball, water aerobics etc. The wooden sun-beds are past it and the cushions are all stained and well past there sell by date. The Beach: Fantastic beach, silky sand and miles long, the sea, warm and like a big wave machine, had a lot of fun in it, the only negative is the beach hawkers, consistently pestering you, even on our last day, last sunset, cocktail on the beach, it would appear to be a general problem in Sri Lanka though. Out & About. Sri Lanka is a huge country and the infrastructure is still pretty basic, the journey down from the airport with a psychotic driver took 3.5 hours, the roads are a bumpy roller coaster ride and not for the fain hearted so be prepared!. There isn’t much outside the hotel, just the busy road and the odd shop. 5 minutes up the road is the Kosgoda Turtle Sanctuary, definitely worth the visit as the guy is doing an amazing job with the ‘little shelled fellas’, and is slowly rebuilding the sanctuary and his home after the devastating Tsunami. 20 minutes away is Bentota, we visited the Mask (museum/shop/workshop) great to see first hand the stunning wood work first hand, also the Bentota Herb Garden was pretty interesting. Down towards Galle we visited Balapitiya for the river safari, well worth a trip, huge water monitor lizards and stunning scenery, make sure you see the Monastery on the River Safari, very humbling meeting the child monks there. Galle was disappointing; the fort was covered in rubbish and didn’t look much like a World Heritage Site to me. Also Hikkaduwa Coral Garden is a miss, most of the coral is dead. The highlight for us was the safari at Uda Walawe National Park (5hr journey), we stayed in the Mahoora luxury campsite 16km into the reserve on new Years Eve, singing Sinhalese songs with the staff at midnight really was something special. Expect to see lots of Elephants (some 400 within the reserve), a wealth of birds, water buffalo, crocs, monkeys, deer, reptiles etc etc….. To sum up the Heritance Ahungalla. Stunning sunsets, great pools and cocktails (Rukmal!) but unfortunately its trying too hard to be something that’s its not, and that s 4 1/2 star hotel..",positive
"I couldn't agree more with the comments below. We stayed there from 26th December until after New Year. Had we been able to get a refund we would have moved out on day 1! Firstly, despite what their website says, all rooms do NOT have a sea view. We were given a room overlooking the tennis courts. After a huge discussion, they said that we could move to a lower category room - where a seaview was availabile - BUT they wouldn't refund us the £450 difference. After I pointed out that they were falsely advertising, the local agent out there agreed to pay for us to upgrade us to a luxury suite - however, the hotel really should have picked up this cost as their website was giving incorrect information! The suite was ok - but not worth the money they charge. Again, their website states luxury goods and free sparkling wine, fruit etc. None of those things materialised! The shower gel was provided in glass bottles which took forever to let the gel out. There was no conditioner, no bubble bath and the cotton buds were only supplied on the first day - all basic things for a 5 star hotel! The lighting is also totally illogical as the person states below. It's certainly not a luxury 5 star property. There's water aerobics in the pool every day - with loud techno music blaring out of the speakers. They had Karaoke in one bar and a very naff electronic keyboard player belting out songs like ""lady in red"" in the other. Not exclusive property that it claims to be! The sun loungers had dirty cushions - which didn't even cover the whole of the lounger - and there weren't enough for the number of guests. You were also shouted at by the hawkers from the beach - which really shouldn't happen at this type of property (I've stayed at lots in Sri Lanka and nowhere else is like that!) Finally, the food. It was very uninspiring for the cost. The upper restaurant was not open the whole time we were there - so the only a la carte menu available was from the coffee shop. I think it's an absolute disgrace to charge the money they do - I was incredibly misled and I too will be lodging a formal complaint. The only saving grace was the location - but frankly - there are lots of hotels in Sri Lanka with just as nice locations - minus the hawkers and at a much cheaper cost!",negative
"Wonderful looking hotel, good location, nice beach, beautiful pool, good standard of room. Staff aren't the best - bit slow and forgetful but not rude.",positive
"We stayed at this place for 4 days 3 nights - US$1,100, included a lame New Year buffet and ""celebration"" (US$125 per person) This hotel bore no resemblance with its sister hotel in the same group Heritance Kandalama (where we stayed over Christmas and which was impressive). The architectual and design elememts that make Heritance Kandalama very special are total lacking in the Heritance Alungalla. The level of service could not compared. The attitude of staff generally was insincere and gear towards tips rather than service. We also had 2 experiences of male staff members making inappropriate comments to the females in our group. The food was uninspiring at best and unhygenically prepared at worst (one of our party and a known other guest were both made ill by poor food preparation.) When the issue was raised on our departure with the most senior staff member made available (only a room division manager), no responsiblity was taken nor apology offered and the stock response was that the guest had not until then made a formal complaint (despite the matter being known to reception and housekeeping staff) and the guest was blamed for not having asked for a hotel doctor at the time. The room we had was an attempt maximizing a corner area and was at first glance impressive. However, not all the electrics were wired up and the basic layout of the location of the light switches was poor (you have to get out of bed to turn off the bed side light). And one of the toilet in the suite smelt which affected our enjoyment of the suite. We couldn't use the sitting area of the suite. To cap it all, having paid US$100 for a vehicle to take us to the airport, the hotel provided a desperately underpower, mini people mover which had no safety belts for passengers (an essential requirement for Sri Lankan roads). Compared to the rest of our experience of accommodation in Sri Lanka, Heritance Alungalla was over-priced and poor value. It is definitely not 5 star accommodation as it claims to be. It just seems to be a money making ""machine"". The main positive point about this hotel is the beach which is beautiful like the rest of the West coast of Sri Lanka (you do have to however put up with beach touts). We will be lodging a formal complaint to the hotel but given their initial response we do not expect any joy.",negative
"I have been at Heritance a few times before and simply love this place. It has got better since the Tsunami and the hotel was refurbished. It is a must stay if you are on a holiday in Sri Lanka. Staff are very friendly and the food fantastic!!! The hotel is great to just relax or there are things around the town to see, Galle is not too far away for a day trip. I will be looking forward to my next stay at this hotel!",positive
"We've just returned from our honeymoon - a week in the Maldives(paradise) followed by a week in Sri Lanka staying in the Heritance Ahungalla. The hotel is beautiful just like any hotel in a major city let it be London, Dublin or New York so if its traditional Sri Lankan style your looking for than its not for you. Our room was looking out onto the ocean however the water was unfortunately too rough for swimming. There wasn't a soul on the beach for the entire duration of our trip apart from the usual hawkers who camp out on the beach for the day in the hope of selling the odd sarong or two. The food was nice but became extremely repetitive when your there for 6 days, bearing in mind there's nothing outside the hotel so no chance of eating anywhere else. If you like a drink and a bit of a buzz at nite then this is also not the hotel for you, the bars have no atmosphere.Your not encouraged to go out of the hotel however saying that there's nothing to go out for in the line of entertainment, shopping or eating just a little shop across the road which sells water and snacks which may come in handy as hotels prices are the same if not even more expenive than home. Once you walk out of the hotel you'll be surrounded by hawkers trying to sell you tours which can be annoying as they're fairly persistent. We went on a local tour by tuk tuk with Raji who camps out outside the hotel or beach, his English is perfect which helps. This was quite enjoyable apart from being brought to two different shops trying to get us to buy stuff, this is standard procedure if u take a tuk tuk anyway. We did the nearby river safari which we booked through our travel rep. This would be very managable and much cheaper to do by travelling by tuk tuk and hopping on a boat when you get there, just a few mins down the road. We also went to a national park spotting elephants, about 9 hrs in a car but enjoyable all the same.All of the staff in the hotel were outstanding very friendly and pleasant. Sri Lanka is really just a country for touring around, the ideal would be 4 or 5 days seeing the sights staying in a different hotel ever nite. As part of a tour I would defintely recommend a nite or two in this hotel but def no longer.",negative
"Just got back from the Heritance and had a marvellous time there.It is beautifully designed,with two infinity pools leading your eye out to the sea.Our room had a great sea view and was very well furnished.Beds were comfy and the bathroom was great-I want a wet room like theirs!!!Premiership matches on the box and two english speaking movie channels. The food was very good and i found myself eating curry three times a day!!i also brought a hopper pan back with me to have egg-hoppers for beakfast.However we were a little disappointed with the fine dining restaurant.The prices are the same as back home, and they had very pretty food on the plate, but it needs Gordon Ramsey to go in and make it less fussy and more tasty.With such good seafood(the tuna is the best!) i would have liked to have seen a japanese restaurant or something similar.The 'mustard' coffe shop was more to our liking-less pretentious and good food,and of course you can always find something nice in the buffet restaurant. Service is very good,if a little too much! Sri Lanka is a paradise for wildlife and the hotel has in it's grounds; egrets,bee-eaters,squirrels,a small monitor lizard,gecko's and on an evening a large bat which we named 'Nora' (Batty!) which swooped around the pool bar while we were sipping pre dinner Martini's! We went on a river cruise through the mangroves which was excellent and a trip to Sinharaja Rainforest ,which is a must for bird watchers.Our driver Erish was the best.He took us around the village he grew up in and to meet some of his family,and releasing baby turtles into the sea at Kosgoda was very satisfying. Don't let tales of war in the north put you off going,you are not affected in the least.Soldiers with guns are at a lot of check points near Colombo,but there are thousands of Tamils and Sinhalese living in perfect harmony,it is lot more safe than Northern Ireland ever was.Just keep away from the north and north east to be on the safe side. They have recovered physically very well from the Tsunami,but anyone you talk to has lost loved ones(60,000 people)There won't be another one for hundreds of years,so don't let that put you off either! The Hotel is excellent and Sri Lanka is a lush,wildlife filled paradise,with sun and picture postcard beaches.It reminded me of a cross between Thailand(with Buddhist temples all over) and the nicer parts of south goa,give it a try.We'll definitely go back.",neutral
"We stayed at the Heritance for two nights at the end of the Kuoni Ceylon South Tour before we flew to the Maldives. The hotel was absolute heaven. We were stunned by the beautiful entrance when we arrived and the rest of our group were very jealous and were tempted to sneak off the bus too! The room was beautiful with an excellent view. The hotel was immaculate, the staff were wonderful, the food was delicious. The only thing that upset us was that the hotel was so quiet. Obviously it was nice and relaxing from our point of view. We were always the only people in the pool and the gym – we felt like celebrities who had hired the whole hotel to ourselves. However the downside of this was that the wonderful staff must make far less in tips when there are so few guests staying. We have sent a letter to Kuoni urging them to make this hotel the standard hotel for the end of the Ceylon South Tour as it was simply the perfect end to our tour. We were sad that we couldn't stay longer.",positive
"I stayed here with my wife for 6 days in June and it really is a fantastic place. The hotel is exceptionally presented, the room we had immaculate, with a stunning sea view. The staff there deserve high praise for making this place what it is, they really know how to look after you and are some of the friendliest people I’ve ever met. Everyone always had a smile and seemed genuinely interested in helping or just making conversation (without being intrusive) whatever time of the day! Their knowledge of football was limited though as they only seem to have heard of David Beckham!! – Cricket is what matters here! The pools were excellent, large and clean & the food in the restaurants (Jute & Mustard) outstanding. The meals were great value (we stayed on B&B basis) with the evening meals costing on average about £35 for both of us (3 courses) including a bottle of wine. (The wine is the same price as UK restaurants) The evenings that we ate in the main restaurant (Jute) this was always buffet with a theme (Chinese, BBQ etc) but there were always other options available. My wife described the curries as the ‘best she’d ever eaten’ The hotel is a little isolated but set in beautiful grounds and right on a great stretch of beach – unfortunately due to the time of year the sea was too rough for swimming. I didn’t really get the impression though that this was a ‘beach resort’ as all the guests stayed by the pools, this maybe however due to the time of year I visited (monsoon season) but the weather was fantastic and extremely hot - also the beaches are public so although they are only trying to make a living you are targeted by the ‘beach hawkers’ as soon as they spot you on the sand! We did a day trip to Galle, incorporating a visit to a turtle hatchery, a river boat safari, mask museum & lunch at a great seafood restaurant. On our check out morning we left for a mini tour to Kandy, visiting the Elephant Orphanage at Pinnawala, the Millennium Elephant Foundation (where as well as learning about the elephants you can ride and feed them – this was a fantastic experience and in my opinion much better than the Orphanage, where the workers main interest seems to be getting as many tips out of you for photo’s as possible!) a tea factory, a herb garden, the Botanical Gardens & the Temple of the Tooth. There is some stunning scenery & views in Kandy and none more so than from the cliff side restaurant we stopped at for lunch, which offered great views for miles across the City. We arranged all our excursions & Airport transfers through Rammuni Tours, (Mr Silva) which were great value and I’d highly recommend to any of my family and friends travelling to Sri Lanka (I’m happy to pass on his contact details to anyone who wants them) Sri Lanka really is a country to be visited & the Heritance Ahungalla is definitely a great place to stay. We are hoping to return some time in the near future and would with out a doubt stay here again.",positive

"we travelled here with our two sons, 13 and 16, in 2001, as a two centre with the maldives, this was our first stop. firstly sri lankan airlines was the best airline we had ever travelled on, even better than virgin. the hotel then was called the triton, which we was upgraded from after we complained, before we travelled, as our original hotel, the swanee, was slated in a telly programme. the hotel was first rate.it's own elephant, numerous weddings going on. beautiful food, even curry for breakfast, if you wished ! ice carving and fruit carving to watch. little chipmunks running all over the place, don't touch them though. a bloke rescued one from the swimming pool, got bit, and was taken to hospital for a rabies jab. sea rough, just paddle and jump the waves. swimming pools good. would watch a large monitor lizard some days, it would wander and then start digging, sadly eating turtle eggs, it was digging up, but hey, that's nature.lots of other little lizards around. and many insects, didn't see any spiders though. took a taxi, they are friendly and cheap, please give them a tip, they work for very low wages, especially the staff at the hotel, my husband gave a bloke that was cleaning up round the pool, a few dollars and he said it was more than he earned in a week ! we went to a turtle farm, worth going, and unawatuna beach, as we were told it may be calmer there, it was a little.we wished we had went to the elephant orphanage, but it was so hot. i know the hotel now is under another name, i hope the people here weren't too badly affected by the tsunami, i know it hit here. did the elephant survive ?i know when we heard of the disaster, our first thoughts were for a family, which sold tablecloths on the beach, and had a little place right up on the right hand side of the beach. they lived here. i still think of them, when i lay down my elephant cloth on my dining table.",positive
"Booked this along with a 5 day stay in Dubai for our Honeymoon last October. Booked through Key2Holidays (also very good!!). The hotel was fantastic, we splashed out and booked one of the top suites - named the 'Cliff Richard' suite and it was amazing (marred by a slight smell of drains in the bathroom - but this was fixed within 30 minutes of raising the concern. Top notch service) Room was large with huge whirlpool bath and rain shower, bed was amazing and surrounded on 3 sides with ocean views..large balcony overlooking the beach..need I say more? Now for the staff, they are without doubt the nicest bunch of hotel staff we have ever experienced. They were all so friendly and genuine. Everyone from the room boys to the pool boys and bar staff were all brilliant!! I cannot say enough good things about them....apart from we hope to see them all again soon. The food to was exemplary, breakfast buffet was top draw with a selection of local, European and American options...all superb. Lunch time we ate mainly at the pool bars which were par for the course...burgers etc but all good. Evening meals were superb; we ate several times in the coffee shop 'Mustard' as it was so good...and cheap! The main restaurant 'Jute' was also ok but on BBQ night it was out of this world. We treated ourselves to 2 special meals; the 1st was on the beach where we ate lobster etc....what a fantastic experience with the sea lapping behind us whilst dining by candlelight. The other was in the 'Upper Room' where we were the only people in there and this was the highlight as both the food and the service was outstanding. Some people have aired their opinions on both the tipping issue and the beach touts so let’s get both these out of the way. Tipping - this has to be put in perspective. The people work very very hard for little pay and do such good jobs so why not tip? We had no problem with this at all and I cannot see what all the fuss is about. Beach touts - Yes they can be a pain but again this is their living. The hotel can do nothing about them as the beach is not private. They will respect your feelings and leave you be, if you tell them to leave you alone and they will never cross the boundary of the hotel. We used a couple of chaps called Charlie and Tino for 3 trips and they were brilliant so if you meet them on the beach tell them we said hi!! Yes they will try and sell you the earth but just be honest and tell them what you want..they will respect this. Overall a fantastic and unforgettable experience!!",positive
"Just as my title says... Heritance Ahungalla is one of the best beach resorts I have been to. This is my 3rd time in Sri Lanka and the 1st time after the tsunami. It is unbelievable how this hotel has been refurbished.. The staff is very friendly and the food is also great. I very much like the view you get as soon as you enter the hotel lobby, where the pool seems like it connects with the sea. Sri Lanka is a brilliant place to visit and Heritance Ahungalla is a must stay resort if you are travelling down south.",positive
"We stayed for Christmas 2007 and agree with other reviewers that the hotel has been beautifully refurbished. We had a fantastic room with a sea view, very comfy bed, huge bathroom, all spotlessly clean. The pool area is stunning and the pool attendants very helpful in brining loungers, towels and refreshing slices of watermelon. A few rupees on day one will get you a great spot and a parasol for the rest of your stay! However we were disappointed with both the food and the service. Yes the fine dinning is superb but overall the food was too ""international"" with very limited choice for those of us that travel in Asia for the delicious local food. As there is absolutely nothing outside of the hotel ,and only very limited choices if you take long a taxi ride to other towns along the coast, we soon became bored with the choice of one Sri lanka curry, one chinese style stir fry and the local dish of Devilled chicken. Personally we don't travel for 11 hours to eat a rack of lamb no matter how good it is! The hotel was busy at it was Chistmas and it took ages to get served, particularly at the pool bar. Over one hour for a sandwich and a beer for lunch on one occaision. Overal the hotel is excellent provided you like an ""all inclusive"" type of holiday. Having travelled extensivley in India, Thailand, and Malaysia we were a little disappointed in Sri Lanka overall. It takes forever to get anywhere as the roads are so bad and so congested, the food wasn't that great anywhere, Columbo is polluted and rather grim. Whilst the beaches in the South are fantastic we enjoyed our stay further North more. Tragically there is still a long way to go to recover from the Tsunami. The lack of tourists is having the effect that those that do go are seen as ""cash cows"" we felt somewhat ripped off on more than one occaision. Beware the moonstone mines - you can buy them cheaper in the UK!",neutral
"We spent three days between Christmas and New Years with our two teenaged boys in a suite with a wrap-around balcony and adjoining standard room overlooking the pool, the beach and the sunset. The rooms were terrific. The beach is perfect, clean of debris and seaweed, nice waves, no jet skis or other annoying motorized marred only by a few too many sarong and t-shirt touts. While breakfast was very good, the dinner buffet offered a large selection of mediocre items. We did not sample either the prix fixe (read: very expensive) or the a la carte menus. Instead we had dinner prepared by Berti, who lives just off the beach north of the resort, and served on the porch of his new home. His former restaurant on the beach was destroyed during the tsunami and now he prepares lobster, prawns and fresh fish cooked over coconut shells that you order during the day from one of the ""guides"" who hang out on the beach. We recommend you find Fredi, who will assist you to order dinner at Berti's, arrange transportation, organize diving and snorkeling excursions and otherwise take care of every need while providing many laughs. Service throughout the hotel was well-meaning and friendly but just barely competent.",positive
"We loved this hotel from the start, we were in a standard room(301) booked through Kuoni with front sea facing balcony and side pool facing balcony. We opted for half board so did not try the coffee shop or fine dining restaurant. Plenty of choice of good quality food but as usual with buffet style food could have been hotter. Excellent, huge pool, did not make use of beach but apparently a few problems with currents. Good facilities all round, enjoyed the hospitality of the Mirror Bar with big screen and good music. Could not fault the staff at all, always plenty on hand, very polite and friendly and not obviously seeking tips. We were entertained to Christmas carols from the children of a local orphanage which was a delight. Highly recommend but regret unseasonal wet weather and not winning the test match at Galle.",positive
"When we i read the inital review for this hotel i read all about eh room that smelt of mold. Well imagine my amusement(not ) after God knows how many hours of travel we arrive....hotel looks lovely...we check in...all good. We get showed to our room - we get showed around and then everyone stands still as the expected tip needs to be handed over. Fine, not great but fine. I then start having an asthma attack, due to the strong smell of mold. Yep I've got the moldy room!!!! We ask to get moved, which was quick and efficient, but i was really annoyed when another tip was expected. At this point i have to say that ws one of my main annoyances about Sri Lanka. of course when you travel to a less fortunate country you expect to tip, but i got out hand. Anyway, hotel was ok...room was nice, good size, bathroom great...Again slight annoyance, they cleaned everyday, but i didn't always think it was that thorough-. The food was fabulous, although we never had the buffet dinner,we ate mainly (when at the hotel) at the 24 h place. the top resturant wasn't open as the hotel wasn't busy enough.Brekafast were wide ranging and very tasty no complaints here. Great gym. which no one uses and it has a fabulous views out to sea- it felt like my own personal gym. The views are great , and the beach is wonderful, never crowded . Once you've told the beach touts that you'll buy something they're pretty good and leave you alone. I'm not sure when they're adding it, but there is no Spa on site, somoen comes in to do massage. I went down the road Eden Hotel & Spa, which i would definitely recommend. Spa is lovely-and they have great food aswell if you want to go for dinner. On the whole the Heritage was lovely, did the job, just a few annoyance, but mainly good.",neutral
"This place is immaculate. From the large infinity pool to the superb restaurants, we had a wonderful time. The staff could not be more helpful and we cant thank them enough for the way they made our stay very special. Tipping is common here and to be honest the staff were that good we felt guilty if we forgot, 100 rupees (about 50pence) was sufficient on most occasions, and they really do appreciate it If you have kids though i would avoid it, the beach is fairly treacherous and the life guards have to work overtime because of the dangerous undercurrents. We went there purely for the relaxation and for the chance to see a bit of sri lanka, there is plenty to see and do and the excursions were pretty fairly priced. Highly recommend this place for a place to chill.",positive
Superb Hotel. Wow what an entrance. Truly loved this hotel. Staff so friendly. Stunning hotel and beautiful rooms. Food to die for. Great swimming pools. All in all a truly great hotel.,positive
"The hotel is a dream, the staff are lovely and the food is fantastic. Don't pay the travel agent or hotel prices for trips, tours and transport you can get them outside the gate at a fraction of the price. We found a couple of lovely guys called Nimal Tours (Nimal and Wimal) who took us all over the place. They were reliable friendly and fun to be with. They live just across the way from the hotel in Station Road Ahungalla, everyone in the town knows them so they are easy to track down. We loved the place and can't wait to go back.",positive
"We spent 12 wonderful nights at the Heritance Ahungalla. My husband, son (8) and I will remember it for the rest of our lives. we flew to Quatar and then to Colombo, where we were met at the airport by the hotel company's driver (aitken spence hotels). We spent 3 hours transfering to the hotel in an old mini van... but it was fully air conditioned and the seats were very comfortable and the views much better from that height than would have been in a car. It was also spotless and the driver gave us a commentary about the places we were driving through. The time went very quickly, was what I considered to be a better class of travel that anyone else on the roads (tuk tuks, bikes etc) and I throughly enjoyed roughing it a little... We saw loads of things on the way too. The hotel was like an oasis. 2 guards opened the gates to the drive and closed them afterwards and the drive was awesome... the beautiful lilly pool at the front of the hotel followed by the reflective marble open reception and onto the infinity pool and then the Indian ocean was breathtaking, truly. We were met at reception and our bags where whisked away by bell boys an we were taken to the cool upstairs hotel bar and given ice cold fruit cocktails - Nelli juice?!?! and passionfruit and weird tropical fruits - YUM! Chilled towels were brought for us to refresh ouselves and it was blissful. check in was done at a leather sofa with the hotel manager and was throughly pleasant. The staff all spoke excellent English (obviously) and even thought the accent was a little difficult to understand, you soon got used to it. We booked this hotel as our 10th Wedding anniversary present to each other, and as such blew all expenses and upgraded to their Luxury Suite which added a 3rd more to the total cost of the holiday... but it was WELL worth it! We stayed in the Sir Cliff Richard Suite... it consisted of a large lounge, triple aspect patio, bathroom with hot tub and jaccuzzi, dressing room and large spacious bedroom with the biggest bed I have ever seen! It had everything. Flowers, candles, home cinema, Dvd library etc. We had ice and canapes delivered eery evening and a free laundry facility (which was great at the end of the holiday). The other rooms we saw were also on the same vein... decorated in the same beautiful wood and ornamentation and were just as lovely, just smaller. The place was spotless. I could have eaten my dinner from the bathroom floor, and everything was taken care of in every way. The babysitting service, which we used twice, was awesome. The chap who babysat looked as if it was more than his life was worth to let anyone in that room! It was wonderful. The hotel was also very beautiful, and the food, which people are seeming to complain about, was AWESOME. We had the most excellent food (please see my photos!) and I cannot understand the remarks from others about the menu etc, because it changed from meal to meal and also nightly. There was a such a selection that you never eat the same meal for 6 months. Also, if there was nothing on the VAST menu that took your fancy, they would prepare you whatever you liked. My son didnt like anythign too spicy, and they were always prepared to whip him up spomething different... local vegetables and rice, beautiful soufles and garnish, beef stew and mashand even common garden variety chips and burgers. You could have had whatever you wanted. The serice was OUTSTANDING... being met and welcomed in such a way is a little unnerving at first because no one is really that nice are they? Yes! These pople who work at this hotel bend over backwards to make your stay wonderful. Being a cynical English girl I thought maybe they were after tips... but no. We didnt tip during the holiday except occasionally if someone really went out of their way (like a guy bringing us spices from the shops which we asked him to get for us if he could). We tipped at the end of the holiday. All tips apparently go into a communal pot, and get divvied up between the staff. It was great, and such a relief! The beach was the only downside. It was rough (even in May and June because its nearly monsoon) and you could not swim... but you could sit at the edge of the water and soak up the gorgeous sun and sea breeze to cool down. it was as warm as a bath. Some days it was hotter than the pools! The hawkers were obsesively *there* but, we said hi, and were pleasant and told them that we would buy something at the end of the holiday if they left us alone, and that is exactly what they did. A nice guy often got us banana's and coconuts for nothing and we shook his hand and off he went, and we would wave and say hi as we went to the beach. We honoured this and bought a sari (wrap around thingy) and a table cloth, simply because they need to make their living and they had not bugged us like I had seen them bug other people (those who rudely ignored them, or buzzed them off and were frankly horrible to them..). It was, however, not necessary to go to the beach because of the wonderful pools and the wonderful cool melon and fresh fruit kebabs brought for you to eat whilst you were taking a dip. Heavenly. I THOROUGHLY reccommend this place to everyone.",positive
"It took us 5 hours in a minibus to arrive to the hotel from Colombo (120 km trip) and few attempts to move to a less moldy room (the rooms are nice and people are very friendly). You quickly realize you’ll be facing the same menu for 8 days at the same restaurant (there is nothing around, and don’t be fooled by hotel “choices” – none was available). The beach is unapproachable – even when the waves and the weather cooperate (July is Monsoon season for the west side of the island) beach vendors would not go away. If you plan trips to other parts of Sri Lanka, well, think again. Getting anywhere from Ahungalla takes many hours by train or bus (we were hoping to visit Kandy which turned out to be 7 to 8 hours trip!). In short, there is absolutely no need to travel all the way to Sri Lanka to be locked in a hotel with no options, no usable beach, and nowhere to visit.",negative
We stayed here for 4 nights following a tour of the national parks of Sri Lanka. The hotel was of a good standard and the food in the restaurants was excellent. The pool was good and the welcome from the staff was great. The only negative point is that the beach attached to the hotel is public and as such has a lot of hawkers on it who will not leave you alone although this is the same on a lot of Sri Lanka's beeches. Even in the monsoon season when we went (could not swim in sea due to its roughness) it was a good break after a tour and i would recommend it to anyone for a short break. Any longer than 5 days however may get boring as there is nothing in the local village.,positive
"We’re a family of 2 Adults and 2 Children on AI we stayed at the Heritance for 5 nights…….only wished we could have stayed more and even contemplated changing our flights! The Heritance is a wonderful, opulent and very peaceful hotel not full of ummmm how can I say this, sorry to offend Brits Abroad. The staff couldn’t be any nicer in fact the best staff we’ve come across, yes, you give them a tip but 100 – 200 rupees isn’t much. The rooms (we had 2) were extremely clean had 2 single beds put together which didn’t bother us, mini bar, a magical bathroom and turn down service just added to that loveliness of it all. There are 2 swimming pools, again both clean and well maintained, the lifeguards bring you sunbeds, mattresses, towels and umbrellas nothing was too much trouble. The hotel wasn’t full in fact only 50 guests in some ways nice but it needed more atmosphere. We had a dinner at the fine dining restaurant but were the only people eating…………could not fault the food but again the lack of atmosphere just put a little dampener on it. Touts on the beach were a little over bearing and it’s a shame that we couldn’t take our children on the beach, we tried once but I started to have a little panic as they surrounded me, but some people from the hotel used them. We did the day trip out and visited Galle, spice and stone factory lastly we visited the turtle hatchery, it was a great day not once did we feel intimated and the Sri Lankan people are so very friendly. Don’t worry about the war in the North we had no trouble whatsoever. Don’t worry about the Tsunami I think that’s what putting people off of going to Sri Lanka. Would I go to Sri Lanka again…………yes without any doubt and maybe try a safari next time. If you're going enjoy.................wish I was coming too!!",positive
stayed for five nights as a family of five and we enjoyed everything about the hotel. The long well maintained driveway and the large pond in front of the entrance. Everybody smiled and spoke to you and were all very happy. The reception when we arrived made you feel instantly welcome. Our rooms were first class clean tidy and well maintained. We were even visited by a tribe of monkeys playing around the walkways one morning. The dinning area and quality of food was excellent. The waiters were all experienced and very helpful. There are two swimming pools both of which were large and clean. The security staff kept the beach area quiet but you could approach the beach boys and banter with them and they all wanted to be your friend and guide. We had no qualms about using a couple of them as guides and these enhanced our experience of the area and the people. The only complaint I had were often the number of flys in the dinning area which was hard to stop due to the open plan design. The entertainment was low key but very fitting for the hotel and its location,positive
"We stayed here between 18-24 June 2007 for part of our 3 centre honeymoon and we were amazed by both the country and the hotel. We were greeted by the Duty Manager and a refreshing cold towel and shown to our rooms following a brief introduction to the hotel as well as a choice of cocktail or wine upon ones arrival. One thing to bear in mind from the momnet you arrive in the hotel, is that tipping is a necessity, 100-200 rupees (50p-£1) is adequate and you will find that you tip practically everyone, so make sure you have small denominations of GBP or USD. We stayed in a standard room over looking the pool and the Indian Ocean. The room was exceptionally clean, with a well-stocked mini bar and a tv with various satellite channels. The room boasted a well equipped en-suite, with a huge walk-in shower. The balcony was big with a table and two chairs which were much used when watching the sun set! The room had wooden floors and tiles in the bathroom and there was seating area within the room with a sofa and table. The pool areas were very clean with plenty of sun loungers around. Once you found the sun lounger of your choice a member of staff would bring towels and an umbrella if so required to you. The jacuzzi was not operational all the time, though that is partly due to the lack of clientele, although when it was turned on, there were very few people using it anyway. Periodically, the waiters would bring round refreshing water melon free of charge which was always welcomed. Waiters were also there if you wanted a drink that would then be brought to your sunlounger. Be wary, if you do get a sun lounger facing the sea, you are likely to be bombarded with the locals trying to sell you their goods. A polite shake of the head will move them on as they cause no harm. The hotel have tried to move on the sellers, but they rely on tourism so basically bear with it or move nearer the pool. Although we were half board at this hotel, it was easy to eat in the coffee shop which was excellent value for money and they had a good range of foods. The breakfast were good, with a wide variety which catered for most nationalities, including Sri Lankans themselves who tend to have Pol Sambol (a type of curry) for their breakfast. The evening meal tends to be a buffet, but as the hotel was pretty empty, we had most of our meals from the A La Carte menu which was excellent. On the occasion we did have the buffet, there was a great choice of barbequed meats and freshly cooked meals, all of very high standards. Dress code is smart /casual. The hotel was only 1/3 full as a result of the lack of tourism following the Tsunami and the Civil War, which is such a shame as a lot of staff had to be laid off as a result. The Civil War is taking place to the far North East of Sri Lanka and it was only on the way back to the airport late at night did we ever see army personnel as there are many check points to go through, but don't let this put you off as it doesn't affect you at all. As a result of the low numbers, the evening entertainment was null and void, although as a honeymooning couple, this did not bother us as it was nice to have a walk around or a couple of drinks in the bar before retiring to the room. That being said, the hotel was busy over the weekend and the evening entertainment did pick up. There is nothing about the hotel we would change. The staff are friendly and extremely attentive and they will go out of their way to help you. The hotel in our opinion was worth every penny and would recommend it to anyone. PLEASE don't be put off with the post-Tsunami clear up as we hardly saw any of it taking place, although the hotel is a constant reminder how strong these people are in the face of adversity. The only evidence that you will see in the immediate vicinity of the resort is the boutique on the beach and you can see where the waves ripped the walls apart. Go to the Heritance Ahungalla, it is wonderful and we certainly go back and it is certainly worthy of its 4* reputation.",positive
"We stayed here in April 2007 and it was absolutely gorgeous. The vista which greeted us - from the marble floored reception to the infinity pool and the Indian Ocean beyond - was just amazing. Photos can't really do it justice (nice as they are). The staff could not do enough for us. In fact I felt a bit uncomfortable to start with, having every wish anticipated, someone always hovering about - to open a door for me, pull a chair out for me, etc. It took me a couple of days to get used to such attentive service - it's not something that happens back home in London! Special mention must go to Jayantha - the restaurant manager. He was so friendly and kind and really made our holiday. The rooms were beautifully furnished and all of them have a sea view. There are two pools, a jacuzzi and a well equipped gym. There is also a library on the 2nd floor with lots of books in English/German and other languages. Food was excellent. The main “Jute” restaurant breakfast buffet was great, as was lunch. Dinner in the Jute restaurant however somehow never seemed as good as lunch - it was usually a buffet with lots of choice but somehow never quite what we fancied. Sometimes the food had been sitting out too long as well. But there was always a freshly-cooked-in-front-of-you option so you could avoid that problem. The food in the Fine Dining restaurant was not included in our package, however we did get a discount in there and I must say it was fabulous. We ate there twice and the seafood was amazing. Well it was ALL amazing! The main bar had a nice snacks menu but again this was not included in our package. They had live music – the set lists usually weren’t quite to our tastes but it was nice that they bothered to have live musicians. One word of warning for those who may be thinking of booking ""semi all inclusive"" - also known as ""full board plus"" - with Kuoni. Kuoni's website and literature leads you to believe (it certainly strongly implies that) ALL your soft drinks will be included, all the time. This is absolutely not true. Soft drinks are only included with your meals. When we were there we met other people who had booked the same deal with Kuoni, expecting unlimited soft drinks all the time, and got there to find this was not the case. We complained to Kuoni about this (to no avail) as we felt we had been deliberately misled on this matter. (However Full Board Plus/Semi All Incl does include one wine or one beer with your meal though as stated). It was really very silly of Kuoni to mislead us on this, as we thought our holiday was fantastic value - even though all our soft drinks weren't free. Watch out for the touts on the beach. This was a problem throughout Sri Lanka. They are dreadfully persistent and a huge nuisance – they made going on the beach at the hotel a bit of a no-no which is a shame as it was a divine beach. If you want to go to the beach I recommend going elsewhere along the coast. Also, ladies watch yourselves when you are out and about. One guy repeatedly tried to feel me up in the supermarket despite the fact I was with my husband! He didn’t get far and ran off pretty quick when I shouted at him, but be aware. But Sri Lanka was amazing and we had an unforgettable holiday. It would be tempting (especially at such a nice hotel) to never leave the hotel but you must – there is so much to see. My personal highlights were the 3000 year old (I think) Buddha statues at Dambulla and the Turtle Hatchery at Kosgoda. The Heritance and it’s lovely staff contributed immeasurably to our holiday and I can't recommend this hotel enough.",positive
"We stayed at this hotel in May 2007 as part of a Kuoni holiday after a tour of the island. The hotel is in excellent condition having being refurbished after the Tsunami. The rooms are spacious with all expected conveniences. Shame that only 10 rooms out of 155 were occupied when we visited as it's a fantastic place to relax. The hotel staff were attentive, maybe a bit too much but that is to be expected with so few guests. The food was exceptional, great choice and different meals every night. Ahungalla village is a bit quiet, there are no places to eat and no bars nearby, the nearest restaurant being Kosgoda Beach Hotel. If staying at the hotel gets a bit boring, take a trip on the train. A half hour journey to Bentota costs 5p!",positive
"We had a lovely Honeymoon in this hotel, the staff where friendly and helpful. The food and choices were amazing with everyone catered for. The room was very clean and the towels where changed up to 3 times per day! Don't forget to tip everyone who helps you, it need only be a little 100 ruppess, 500 for a room boy for a week.",positive
"My husband, daughter (6) and I have just returned from a 14 night stay in the Heritance Ahungalla. This was our first visit to Sri Lanka and we can not wait to go back! What a wonderful country. The hotel was set in beautiful surroundings, so peaceful and sits on a gorgeous part of the coast. On arrival we just knew we would be able to relax there. Staff employed in the hotel are a credit to it. They were very professional and always eager to help and to make sure we were enjoying our stay. A number of them were very kind to our daughter and helped make her holiday extremely enjoyable - especially the restaurant staff. We took the ""full board plus"" option and have to say the food was outstanding - even plenty of choice for our 6 year old daughter. Each night the food was very different - Sri Lankan, Oriental, Western, Barbeque etc with chefs cooking some items freshly in the restaurant, to order (Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner). There is also a fine dining restaurant that was highly recommended by other guests (extra charge) but because we were enjoying the inclusive food so much, never felt the need to try the fine dining. The rooms were kept clean to a very high standard. The beds were extremely comfortable and there were shutters on the window to completely black out any early morning light. We initially had a problem because there was no third bed for our daughter - but when we mentioned it, it was sorted within minutes and reception staff went out of their way to make sure we were happy. Bottles of water were left in the room every day and toweling robes were provided. Other previous comments mention being pestered for tips but when you realise how these people are living and how little they have, giving a 100rs (50p) tip for drinks/meal/cleaning room etc is a small price to pay for the gratitude you receive when you do it. The staff go out of their way to do what they can for you. As for the people on the beach - please take previous comments with a pinch of salt. Yes, there are people on the beach and you should be prepared for this, but these are local people who have just as much right to be there as any tourist. All they are doing is trying to earn a living in an environment where employment is extremely hard to come by and many are still suffering the long term effects of the tsumani. We did two, two day tours from the Hotel - one with Kuoni and one with a couple of guys from the beach (Chali & Upul). The Kuoni tour (to Kandy & Elephant Orphanage) was expensive and very much aimed at getting you into places associated with Kuoni where the guide would get his commission on your purchases - even to extent of ushering you away from places you wanted to visit. To be fair, the guide had a very extensive and interesting knowledge of the country. The tour with Chali & Upul from the beach (to Galle and Yala National park & safari) was arranged by them at very short notice, used the same type of vehicle as the Kuoni tour, the driver was great and we were able to visit little tiny villages, go off the beaten track, stop at deserted beaches, markets, fish sellers, cashew sellers etc. They organised the hotel, the safari, and always made sure our daughter was safe. A number of other families in the hotel had also used these guys for day trips out and about. By the end of our holiday we had got to know them so well, we visited one of their houses and also spent our last evening sitting on the beach with them, and we exchanged gifts before going home (the ladies on the beach were very grateful for left over shampoo etc). The hotel is fairly isolated but there is no problem with getting a tuk tuk to Hikkaduwa, Bentota, Turtle Hatcheries, Ayurveda Massage or the fantastic river safari which is very close by (don't miss it!!) - again, the guys on the beach were very reliable for organising all of these. The only criticism of the hotel would be the lack of inventive entertainment. The entertainment was very low key - which in itself isn't too much of a problem, but it was fairly repetitive. Additionally, there was no childrens entertainment at all, either during the day or at night - although this did not stop our daughter from having fun. Overall, we had a fantastic holiday and would not hesitate to return to either Sri Lanka or the Heritance Ahungalla.",positive
"My family stayed here for 5 nights in April 2007, and found the whole experience to be excellent. The staff are helpful, the pools beautiful and clean, the rooms large and stylish and the food excellent and varied. Would reccomend this hotel to anyone wishing to relax in style after travelling around SL.",positive
"My husband and I recently stayed at this hotel, and we had a great time! The service was excellent... the staff is very friendly and courteous. The rooms were very clean and the design and decor of the rooms were very modern with hints of Sri Lankan culture. The food was so great! We got the all-exclusive deal (not inclding alcohol) and it was great that we got to taste a lot of different types of food at the buffets for every meal. There was so much variety of foods that I couldnt even decde what to eat most of the time! Overall, this has climbed to to the top of the list of my favorite hotels for me and I would go back to Heritace Ahungalla on my next visit to Sri lanka. If you are looking for a quiet, peaceful vacation this is the place for you!",positive
"We stayed here for 2 weeks at the end of March and first week of April. Mostly, I would agree the previous writer's review. If you wish to really see Sri Lanka then I would suggest that you stay here at the end of your holiday as it is quite far south and means that travel to places such as Kandy are extremely long and tiresome and the driving is something else to be seen, I would describe it as a 'white knuckle ride'!. The hotel is well designed but I would struggle to place it in the 4-5* bracket (try out hotels in Malaysia and you will really see the difference). There is a so called shop in the hotel which really does not sell any essentials such as shampoo so make sure you take your own hair products. Also, we bought factor 40 sun tan cream which did not work and we were severely burned (another couple had the same experience) so again, make sure you take your own sun tan creams and after sun with you. Regarding the beach terrorists, they do hassle you. We were followed for an hour on the beach by 5 of them who just would not give up, no matter how politely you said you weren't interested. They called and shouted to you if you were sunbathing near the beach and the only thing to do was to completely ignore them. One day we went outside the hotel to go the the pharmacy to buy some after sun lotion (due to the rubbish cream the shop had sold) and found exactly the same hassle, we lasted about 20 minutes before going back to the hotel. Our room smelled damp when we initially entered and the air con never seemed cool, the staff knocked on the door daily, sometimes 4-5 times to check the room was ok. However, I think this had more to do with wanting a tip. One time they completely ignored the 'do not disturb sign' and still persisted. The restaurant did offer a very good selection (buffet style) and quality of food, the only thing that let it down was the length of time it took you to get a drink when requested, especially as the ratio of staff to customers was overwhelming at times. If you don't like being hassled then maybe this isn't the place for you. In terms of the staff, all were very friendly and polite apart from one or two who seemed to have tipping on their agenda as a priority more than genuine customer service. All in all, a good quality hotel but if they really wish to put themselves in the 4-5* bracket, they are missing a lot of extras which you would normally expect.",negative
"Hi, It's a bit late, but we stayed at the Heritance in mid-Feb as part of a Sri Lanka/Maldives vacation. We booked 8 nights at the Heritance (we actually spent 1 of these nights at the Citadel in Kandy as part of an optional tour - which was very nice too). Arrival & check-in:- After a long drive down from Colombo it was nice to arrive at such a fantastic lobby area, which an amazing view across the infinity pool to the ocean. Check-in process was slick and professional, with welcome drinks and cool/refreshing towels etc. Room:- We had a superior suite and were very happy with the decor, space, quality of the beds and the bathroom, with open window from beach, deep bath, and enclosed soaker shower area. There was a welcome basket and also snacks provided. Every day they provided 2 bottles of mineral water and there was a nice turn-down service. Facilities:- The hotel also had a modern air-conditioned gym area with cold towels, cold water, and almost un-used, modern equipment. There were 2 pools (1 was right outside our block and the other nearer the reception). There was also badminton and tennis - although I didn't use these. There were a couple of bars and a ""nightclub"" (late bar with music and small dance-floor area), and of these there was a criminally under-publicised happy hour (2-4-1) which we missed out on for the first couple of night until someone brought it to our attention. Such was the level of service, you could actually order your first drink just before happy hour finished, then go to dinner, and collect the free drink afterwards, or you could just take it to dinner (i.e. no silly rules were applied). Food:- We were half board, and the main restaurant was well equipped, with a diverse mix of meals, that did not get repetitive over the 8 days. You could choose to pay for an a la carte restaurant and fine dining, but there did not seem huge take-up for this. In addition, the staff were extremely attentive, and very chatty/friendly. They did a couple of special nights whilst we were there – some were a little extra if you wanted to do them (e.g. Valentines, and private beach dining), and some were free (for example, a night on the beach on the weekend and a special a la carte evening in the restaurant on a different day) Beach and vicinity:- Wonderful long beach, very clean and picturesque. There are a lot of beach boys and girls selling their wares and their trips, which can be annoying if you just want a little dip in the ocean, but once you get to know them they remember you and your hassled a lot less. There is not really much in walking distance of the hotel in all honesty, but you are not really that far away from Kosgoda turtle hatcheries, and it’s easy to go further south along the coastal road to Hikkaduwa and Galle – which make for quite a nice trip to do in a day. Downsides??:- Due to poor levels of tourism, there are quite a few good offers available, and the hotel themselves had some local special deals on the weekends. The problem with this is that you end up feeling lousy when you know what you’ve paid versus some of the late deals. I would recommend really shopping around, as it really would be a fantastic bargain at some of the prices people managed to get. It’s quite quiet, and dare I say lacks a bit of atmosphere. At the start I really enjoyed the almost private exclusivity of the service and relaxing ambience, but I must admit to yearning for something a bit livelier at least 1 or 2 of the days during the stay. More guests would solve this, plus maybe a better publicised happy hour and some varied entertainment. All in all a great stay – one of the best beach locations, nicely designed hotel, with great staff and good standard of food…it just needs more business to make it a bit livelier, but I think Sri Lanka is still affected across the island in this way.",positive
"I stayed at the Heritance Ahungalla for a 2 week holiday with my Mum in March. We were originally booked to go to the Ramada (Golden Sun) at Kalutara but asked to change by our holiday company Mercury Direct as they had overbooked this hotel. Looking at this website and after a few enquiries we were very pleased to change to the Heritance Ahungalla and looking forward to the trip. Firstly I feel I need to mention that I have never experienced roads or driving quite in the way we did on the journey from the airport to our hotels. I’ve been to quite a few countries where the driving is appalling and the roads are pretty basic but in Sri Lanka the driving is something else! Think it is fair to say that if you get in the slightest bit travel sick on journeys, definitely take your remedies here! After a long journey from the airport it was a delight to see the beautiful entrance to our hotel with an open plan lobby and the view of the pool. Just like the pictures we’d seen. Hotel Overall the hotel is beautifully decorated and nicely spaced out with 2 beautiful pools. There are a few bars and places to eat including a fine dining restaurant. Most meals are in the main restaurant and served buffet style, unless there is a shortage of guests, which we found and then they put on a set menu.(not so great unfortunately) There is an excellent gym that seems to have a lot of new equipment hardly used and a handy library if you read all the books you’ve brought with you and need some more. There appears to be plenty of security around, especially in the beach area. Unfortunately they are unable to stop the beach sellers from staring and shouting at you at every opportunity. Sometimes this was a bit intimidating and you felt like you had to “run the gauntlet” if you want to dip your toes in the ocean. They were very persistent despite all our polite no thankyou’s and at times I felt my patience was tried! Room We were extremely pleased with our very spacious room. Beds were reasonably comfortable with massive pillows. Nice balcony area to sit and watch the sunset. Think the air con could do with being set a little cooler in the rooms but overall we were pleased with our room (probably one of the best we’ve stayed in on our travels). There seemed no end of staff to make sure we were satisfied with our room and happy with the cleaning and we were asked nearly every day if we were happy with our room. There is plenty of tea and coffee making facilities in the room as well as a good size safe to store your valuables. The bathroom was lovely too with a divine shower that was like standing under a waterfall. Bathrobes and slippers provided too! Restaurant We were fortunate to be all inclusive as our booking with the other hotel had to be honoured. There were a few restrictions as to where and when we could eat and drink but it wasn’t unreasonable. The Coffee Shop was good for food but extremely slow for service. We had to go there at least half an hour before we were due to get hungry so that we weren’t starving when the food arrived. When the main restaurant serves buffet, it was fantastic. There is an excellent choice for every taste and I highly recommend the desserts. Due to the lack of guests in the hotel, (37% occupancy) on quite a few occasions they had to resort to a set menu at lunch times and a few times in the evening. Although I completely understood the reasoning for it not being cost effective I felt it was too restrictive and didn’t really allow for people with plainer tastes. At lunch times the set menu could have had salads as a choice rather than two hot courses. Service From the moment we arrived the service was excellent but we did seem to notice this tapered off in the second week for some unknown reason. Drinks weren’t served as promptly and on quite a few occasions we had to ask if there was a problem. In fact our lunch on the last day was such a disaster we had to complain about the service. There was no excuse for it as, as I’ve said there were hardly any guests, and in fact more staff than guests in the restaurant just standing around. The management swiftly resolved the issue when we complained and we were impressed by the improved service during our last evening meal. There was another issue that we, along with some other guests staying at the hotel encountered with a member of staff in the restaurant. I wouldn’t normally mention something like this in a review but I felt fellow travellers should be warned. When we arrived we were told about the damage to the hotel from the tsunami (if you’ve read previous reviews you’ll see that it was quite badly affected) and the hotel staff seemed quite proud that no members of staff or their relatives were lost. A particular waiter in the restaurant approached myself and my mum during dinner and proceeded to tell us that he had lost his wife in the tsunami and he had 2 sons to provide for. We of course expressed our sadness to him. A couple of days later he approached my mum and other guests while they were sunbathing on the beach, stating that a couple of diners had left the restaurant without paying and he was expected to foot the 3000 rupee bill. He also stated his son needed shoes that were 2000 rupees. Alarm bells rang and as a result of this, some of the guests approached the Food and Bar Manager, who confirmed both “stories” were in fact untrue. The waiter and his wife were separated, and at no time did any diners leave without paying. He stated the member of staff would be severely reprimanded. This as you can imagine, left a bit of a nasty tinge to an otherwise lovely stay and I hope that no one in the future will be taken in by his stories especially as it takes advantage of such a horrific event that we witnessed from afar. To balance out the bad I would like to give a special mention to the lovely girls in the restaurant and “J” the food and bar manager as well as the bar staff by the main pool, they provided excellent service and made us feel very welcome. The area surrounding the hotel is pretty quiet and quite isolated and near to the end of the holiday I felt a bit stir crazy. There isn’t anywhere to really walk to and I feel that the hotel could do with a little arcade of shops other than the gem shop that it has. I guess if you truly want to get away from it all and do nothing but lie in the sun and go on the occasional trip it is ideal. We went on a few trips around the middle of the holiday. Good to give yourself sometime to recover from the travelling especially if you go on a trip to Kandy with the driving being horrendous. (But that’s another story) There is a variety of wildlife around the hotel (including fanta-loving chipmunks) and if you are lucky you may get to see the troop of monkeys that come to visit the front of the hotel on a regular basis. Above all a lovely holiday and a very nice hotel although some improvements could be made to make it truly a 5 star plus hotel.",positive
"We stayed here 4 nights in February 2007 after a private tour of Sri Lanka’s cultural sites and it was lovely to just relax at a beautiful location. A wonderful hotel, lovely rooms, delicious gourmet food, especially the lobster and prawns and the attentiveness and service from the staff was truly outstanding. Sadly the planned ‘Six Senses’ spa has been put on hold due to concerns with lack of visitors with the reason troubles in Sri Lanka however the hotel seemed very receptive to my feedback that they need to make massage and treatments available outside overlooking the beach with the waves lapping in the background – that would be pure bliss! We definitely hope to return to this hotel and met others who were on their ninth repeat stay because they loved it so much. R&J aged 49 and 50",positive
"We recently stayed at the Heritance and I can say that it was an absolute delight. From the moment you arrive it takes your breath away -- the drive up to the front of the hotel brings you to the view through the lobby, out over the pool and to the see beyond. The hotel's refurbishment has been sumptuous -- beautiful furniture, stylish decor and very well appointed rooms. The food was excellent. Every day we'd see the restaurant manager who would talk to us by the pool and tell us what the specials were going to be that evening, and on the one occasion we went to the fine dining restaurant we had the most exquisite food. We were brought two extra complimentary courses and had wonderfully attentive service (although I have to say that a very minor downside here was that I don't think the staff realised that the CD they had put on was a Christmas CD, which wasn't too appropriate in late January, but never mind...) It was rather heartbreaking that there were so few tourists around in such a beautiful hotel.",positive
"We honeymooned here for six nights in January 2007. The hotel has been totally redecorated since the tsunami and is absolutely gorgeous. From the moment we came up the driveway to see the open-plan lobby and the stunning infinity pool reaching all the way to the sea, we knew we were on to something good. Our room (two hundred and something - not sure if it was a superior) – fairly large with lovely decor, great bed, beautiful walk-in shower, dressing gowns/slippers, plentiful 'accessories'. Kept spotless. All we could have wanted, really. Hotel - just so beautiful - airy, spacious, lovely water features, two beautiful pools, great beach. Unbelievably relaxing. Restaurants - great and fairly inexpensive food – we ate soooo well. The fine dining room was really very special. One night they had a buffet with a choice of 70-odd courses – incredible! There are also many 'special event' set meals – eg seafood, local fish etc set meals. Lovely afternoon tea. Fantastic service, particularly from Laki – well done he! Staff - faultless really, attentive, sweet and helpful. Area - very quiet indeed with no centre (unlike eg Bentota). Didn't bother us at all as the hotel was so divine and we'd already done a lot of sightseeing and travelling before we arrived. We visited the lovely little turtle sanctuary up the road though - don't miss it, the owner has had to start again since the tsunami. Sadly, the hotel was almost empty despite it being high season. They really want visitors – do not worry about tsunami or the civil war as there really is nothing to worry about – just please, please go and stay there and enjoy everything the country has to offer. It is really, really beautiful. We had an unforgettable time and we'd go back in a flash.",positive
"I stayed here for 1 day in early August. I had previously visited 3 years before that and been impressed. Now, following its post tsunami refurb it is even better. Apparently the refurb was done by a pupil of the original architect, the late Geoffery Bawa, and it is true to his tasteful modernism. The decor is largely monochrome, though the main bar is stunningly mirrored. The rooms are superb. The food wasnt quite as good as I remembered, but there was a superb seafood barbecue at Sunday lunch. Apparently prices have gone up (I was treated by a relative), but it truly is a superb hotel. Well done Aitken Spence Hotels!",positive
"A party of 11 of us travelled to Sri Lanka and stayed at the Triton Hotel all inclusive, food excellent, accomodation excellent. Our wedding was out of this world and the staff were excellent. The wedding ceremony far exceeded our expectations lasting approx 1hr with Kandyan dancers and drummers and singers led by an elephant a truly awesome experience that we will never forget. Fantastic value for money. We look forward to returning in the near future. Very friendly locals make sure you take a look around the village outside the hotel, take some pens, paper, etc for the local kids and see them smile.",positive
"The Triton has been renovated and relaunched at the Heritance Ahungalla (May 2006). Under the management of Aitken Spence, a major Sri Lanken hotel group, they have attempted to move away from their previous 'all inclusive' package approach to become 'Sri Lanka's first 6 star hotel'. To be honest, they have a long way to go to achieve this level. We visited in June, very shortly after they reopened. In fact, building work wasn't completed and the new Spa will not be on line for 6 months or more. It is a bit hard to know how to be fair to this hotel. They've done a great job renovating the public areas of the hotel. Although only one bar & the coffee shop were open when we were there they were very attractive, with attentive service and good (but not outstanding) food. There was also a small libary, well stocked with books for beach reading. However the biggest drawback is the size of the bedrooms. In comparison to other Sri Lankan top end hotels - such as the Galle Lighthouse Hotel or Dambulla Kandalama - the rooms and bathrooms (no bath provided) are very small. Although nicely decorated they lack a feeling of space and light. Plus the layout of the hotel means that many rooms look (indirectly) into other rooms. Staff vary from excellent (thoughtful and friendly) to down right annoying in their continual expectation of tips. The better staff including the restaurant staff were good, but lifeguards and one room boy were very pushy. Plus the internet access is ridiculously expensive ($US15 hour - over 4 times higher than anywhere else we stayed). The beach is long and undeveloped. The two pools are spacious, with plenty of deckchairs (however there were only 15 - 30 people there at the time). All in all a reasonalbly good hotel, but they have some way to go to meet the standards they have set for themselves. I was a bit disappointed and would, if I had my time again, had chosen to stay in longer Galle in preference to moving along the coast.",neutral
"Heritance Ahungalla Hotel Formerly The Triton Hotel Ok, so here we go with a long awaited review of the newly refurbished and renamed Triton Hotel in Ahungalla, Sri Lanka. The new name is as it is above, Heritance Ahungalla, why??, well this is now a very much upmarket hotel, and if I owned it and had spent the amount of time, effort and money on it as the owners have then I too would want it to stand out as an outstanding property, and you have to believe me here when I tell you that this is exactly what they have now made this very popular hotel to be, so hence the new name.. No expense has been spared here, and it is VERY visible from the time your vehicle arrives at the extremely impressive lobby entrance, a sight that will leave you truly mesmerised and enchanted forever!!, ok, so you may say that as a previous guest I have seen it all before, yes, but with a MAJOR change, and that is the welcome you will receive, not only from the doorman, but from all staff that are in that area, be it a bell-boy or a passing manager, trust me, everyone will welcome you with open arms, warm hand shakes, and. genuine smiles. I will continue this review as events unfurled upon my arrival: Arrival at the Lobby entrance, after a drive along the impressive driveway, my car comes to a stop, then without knowing it, the door is opened by the doorman, I am greeted by a very warm good afternoon sir, and welcome to Heritance Ahungalla, by someone who I have actually known for several years, Dudley, but because he cannot be sure, he uses the welcome that everyone receives. I am quickly, and very politely ushered into a very nice and coolly air conditioned place, well, I should have known it really, The Bacchus Bar, and here I am welcomed very warmly indeed by a very nice lady from the guest relations executive, well actually her name to be polite is Warshi, (pronounced Varshi) and I may add a very nice lady too. Oh, I nearly forgot!!, the flowers!!, where else was I going to get a beautiful garland of Orchids draped around my neck??, and by such a lovely lady??, yes you are right, no where else on this earth that is for sure!!, only here at Heritance Ahungalla. So, what’s next?, oh my god!!, another old friend, Don (Head Barman) appears from nowhere, bearing a very cooling white and sweetly smelling face towel, and a menu of fabulous cooling welcome drinks to chose from, after shaking hands with someone I had not seen for around 4 years, I gladly accept his offer of a cooling Passion Fruit cocktail, how very civilised, and of course after the long drive from airport, how VERY welcomed too. Seem too good to be true? Well trust me; that is how it actually happened!! Registration Ok, so the hotel knows who is arriving, so part of the sometimes long and drawn out registration forms are already pre filled, but here I find something a little different from most hotels I have visited, no, not only here in Sri Lanka, but in most parts of the world, the lovely Warshi asks if I have a business card?, and if so, then all I need to do is to sign, and she will fill in all the boring details later, again, how very civilised?, business card parted with, I sign on bottom line, so what was the easiest hotel registration I have ever had, was completed., so far so good?, NO, so far EXCELLENT. Escort to room: After one of the most pleasant registrations to ANY hotel I have stayed in, anywhere in this world of ours, it was time to be shown to my room, NO!!, not just shown to an elevator or stairway, and hopefully pointed in the right direction, I was actually escorted to my room by the lovely Warshi, and to my surprise, when we arrived, all of my luggage was already there!, hmmm, now how did the bellboy know that?, when I did not even know my room number until I arrived at the door??, magic??, or just maybe professionalism?, I suspect the latter here. Upon arrival, I was shown all of the controls, and light switch operations, of which there appeared to be many, but after a while, it is clear that all is quite simple really, even for me!. Ah Ha, I think I have caught them out!!, I quickly notice that the sockets are no good for recharging my quickly failing mobile phone!!, how wrong I was to be proved, within 1 minute, my phone was on charge, courtesy of very rapidly supplied adapter!, incidentally this was left in room for the duration of my stay, very useful too. So, after approximately 20 minutes of arrival, here I am in my new home for the next month or so, with around a couple of hours or so till dinner, and yes I was a little hungry after my long journey from London, I decided to unpack and freshen up a little. From now onwards, I will describe the hotel facilities: Accommodation: Large, airy, and well illuminated rooms. Mine is a first floor deluxe room (202), well actually all of the rooms here are mostly deluxe, and I can only comment on these, as I never ventured into the more luxurious rooms/ suites. Large, no, a VERY large double bed, at least 6 foot square, so plenty big enough for me, and I like lots of room in mine. Room very tastefully furnished with up to date and very modern décor, and fittings and floor coverings, including fitted wardrobe, with plenty of hanging space, and drawer space too. Light comes on when door is opened, off when it is closed. Electronic, and I may add, easy to use safe too, free of charge, nice change here from some hotels. Large flat screen television, with facility to plug in your video camera/player, or kid’s games consoles too, simple but such a nice touch here I think. IDD telephone. Tea/Coffee making facility, complimentary I may add. Mini bar, chargeable though! Working area, consisting of desk, chair, and would you believe 2, yes 2 internet ports, so if you are thinking of bringing a laptop, then you have in room facility for internet, very useful. Bathroom, well, this will take your breath away I think, a bathroom to die for, especially that huge walk in shower with the biggest head I have ever seen on any shower!!, but a word of caution here I think, if you have a ground floor room, then please make sure you pull the blinds, because the walls are all made of toughened glass!!, don’t want to upset the locals do we?. Oh, just in case, an extension telephone by the loo too!!, came in useful for me, you know, how many times does your phone ring when you are in the loo at home??, exactly! Bathroom equipped with hair dryer, shaver adapter, fluffy bathrobe and slippers, and plenty of toiletries too. Easily adjustable and very effective air con and ceiling fan are fitted as standard in all rooms. Rooms kept spotlessly clean by room attendants, towels changed twice daily, bed linen daily. Oh, and a nice large, well furnished balcony too, with pool/ocean view. Pools: 2 Huge pools as before, both now retiled in new colours, main one now lighter shade of blue, old blue pool, now a tasteful shade of green, both pools lovingly keep clean and clear of fallen leaves and other debris by the pool attendants/lifeguards. Watch out for the kingfishers here, beautiful! Lifeguards on duty from 8.00am till 8.00pm. Sunloungers/ Umbrellas: All supplied free of charge dotted around the grounds, on the beach, and under nice shady trees, towels also supplied free of charge and clean each day, so no need to pack yours! Oh, a really nice little extra here, watch out for a waiter strolling around with some really nice goodies!!, yes, some ice cold, fresh fruit kebabs, really refreshing I can tell you in the hot sunshine, and free too!. Beach Extremely large, and very deserted stretch of beach, right in front of the hotel, nothing to your left for what seems miles!!, and to the right, the ancient fishing village of Ahungalla, with a nice little gift shop about 500 meters away owned and run by a nice lady called Melani, yes she is back despite having her original shop and home destroyed by the Tsunami, oh by the way, no visible signs of Tsunami damage along this stretch of beautiful beach. Lifeguards on duty from 8.00am to 8.00 pm in case you fancy a dip in the very warm Indian Ocean. Bars: So, want to keep hydrated and cool in all this hot sunshine?, well now you can have a cooling relaxing drink in your choice of no less than 5 bars, yes 5! Bacchus Bar Premium air conditioned cocktail bar, where any cocktail, yes any! will be professionally prepared for you by some of the best cocktail barmen to be found anywhere, just ask, and it will be yours within a quick shake of the cocktail shaker. Very well furnished, using some of the best materials known, including volcanic lava from Indonesia, exquisite! Light background piped music. Pool Bar/Mirror Lounge Self explanatory really, nice cooling drinks next to the main pool, very comfortably furnished too, snacks/sandwiches, tea and coffee available during the day here. Mirrors on entire ceiling and walls, very pleasant. Wall Bar This is an old favourite by the Green Pool, very nice and airy, and very well thought out and furnished. Apollo Bar Now, this will maybe be the most popular bar in the entire hotel, situated on the first floor, and spreading the entire width of the main building front, it is air conditioned, and has fab views of the pool and the ocean, that will be illuminated during darkness hours. Piano background music 3 times a week. Also on offer here, a fantastic range of international coffees, and cigars for the quiet relaxing period after dinner. Opious Room Doubles as a nightclub/ disco, with live band entertainment and Karaoke several times a week, extremely pleasant, and very professionally decorated too, also air conditioned. All bars are served by waiters, so no queuing for service, with all the most popular international drinks on offer, as well as local favourites too. . A point worth mentioning here I think, cool face towels offered when ordering first drinks, very considerate. Prices are the same, no matter what bar you use. Dining The Triton Hotel always had a great reputation for its food, and now would you believe it is even better than before, no, it is MUCH better. There are 3 main food outlets, and are described as follows: Main Restaurant Open for breakfast, lunch and dinner, this is in the same place as before, but has been totally transformed, and once inside the door this will be immediately apparent to you. It has been split into 2 sections, one is completely air conditioned, the other is part open air, and the only place that smoking is now allowed. Completely new furnishings and the ceiling of main part is covered in very eye catching Batik material, extremely impressive. Food, Breakfast and I suspect lunch is buffet style, with a vast selection on offer. Dinner is mainly of the fixed menu type, with at least one meat, fish and vegetarian dish on offer, as well as starter, soup, dessert, and tea/coffee too. I was extremely impressed by the quality here, and never during my month long stay was the same menu on offer more than once, quite amazing I think. Quality, and presentation is something to be simply amazed at, actually, sometimes I did not know whether I should eat my meals, or take photos of them, quite simply fantastic quality. I have included a photo of one course from a fixed menu dinner with this review. Triton Café (formerly The Coffee Shop) Mainly Ala Carte menus on offer here, with some snacks too and a very good alternative to the main restaurant, open air with lovely views of pool and ocean during daylight hours. Open 24 hours. Upper Room (Fine Dining) Now, where do we start here?, this is simply the BEST fine dining restaurant I have ever come across anywhere on my travels around the world!!, it would be very difficult to describe in words, but it is really fantastic, not only of course for it’s dinner menus but also for it’s stunning views across the pool and ocean, absolutely magnificent. I dined twice here during my stay, and to say I was totally impressed would surely be a big understatement, I challenge any hotel to even match this, let alone better it. Room service is available 24 hours a day. Service Quite simply put, the service that you will receive at this hotel is second to none! In my honest opinion it cannot get any better than this. No matter what you are doing, having a fine dining meal, or simply going to the beach, the service is very professional here. NOTHING is too much trouble. Quite an achievement when you consider that this hotel had been closed for 16 months, and most of the staff had not worked during that period, it was almost as if they had been working all the time. These people will willingly do anything for you at anytime, day or night, and always with a warm smile, and you are welcome madam/ sir, a credit to all of them, no wonder they are very proud of their hotel and jobs. I have seen service that comes a little close to this, but it has always cost a little tip before!!, NOT the case here. Simply put, if this hotel for some reason or other does not get its 6 star rating, it will not be because of the service, this is real professional 6 star service here, and it shows. Other Facilities Other facilities available at this fantastic hotel include the following: Information Centre Where you can get all kinds of information about the hotel, country, tours and trips ect, including where the reps will be holding their welcome meetings. Business Centre High Speed internet access, fax machines ect. Shopping Arcade Although not yet open, there will be a variety of shops, including gifts, jewellery, I believe one will owned and run by Aida, one of Sri Lanka’s finest! Sixth Sense Spa One of the worlds leading Spa chains will be opening here at Heritance, not until November 2006 though, check their website for more details. Critiscms Very hard to find fault here, but I did try to find something, but alas, to no avail, but…maybe one, Niran, the girls uniforms, I know this is a bone of contention at the moment, but for me, and I know the girls think this too, I honestly believe they should be wearing saris, and not the designer ones they currently have!!, just a small consideration here, it simply does not look right for a high class hotel in Sri Lanka. So, there it is, my much waited for review of this brand new hotel, it was always an excellent one in it’s old Triton days, but.., it is now so much more, and it shows, yes, it is a very much upmarket resort hotel, and on one of Sri Lanka’s finest stretches of beach. I am a very much travelled person, who enjoys the little luxuries in life, but this hotel exceeds by a long way what I have become used to in recent times, and yes, that does include The Triton Hotel that I had become so used to in recent years, my advice to anyone wanting a fabulous relaxing holiday, and to be extremely well looked after?, well the answer is simply, you CANNOT get better than this! I had a fabulous month here at Heritance Ahungalla, and will be returning later this year in November, so to Niran Ratwatte, and your fabulous staff, I will see you then, and thank you for your hospitality.",positive
"Me and my girlfriend stayed at the Triton at Christmas 2004 and were there on Boxing Day when it was hit by the Asian tsunami. The hotel was devastated and, I think, a member of the hotel staff was killed by the second wave. This is only a short note to say that the staff at the Triton, from the porters and bar staff right up to the managers, were probably never tested like they were that Christmas - and they came through brilliantly. They never abandoned the guests, even though no one knew if another wave was coming (and the rumours were that another one was coming) and even though they had families of their own elsewhere on the island who may have been affected. They were calm, smart and caring and they were a credit to the hotel and the country. When some people were debating whether to swim for higher ground or bolt once the first wave receded, they told us to stay put, that it was the safest bet and that that way we'd be evacuated before the day was out - and they were right on all counts. In the 2 days we were there before the tsunami hit, the Triton looked like it was in need of an overhaul. I hope the refit works out well. The location is stunning: on Xmas Day I walked along the beach towards Ahungalla village - it was idyllic, the sea was like bathwater and the colours of the locals in bright saris walking up from the village add a little local spice. However, some people might find the attention of the locals on the beach a bit suffocating; bear in mind that this will be even more so given their dire circumstances since Xmas 2005. However, they are sweet people and are only trying to make a living. Anyway, big thanks to the staff at the Triton: they were brilliant in the most trying of times.",positive
We stayed at the Triton Christmas 2001. We did a tour the first week and then had Christmas at the beach. The Staff was great and so was the food. We hope to go back one day.,positive
"I stayed at Triton Hotel in Dec 2004 I had the most wonderful holiday of my life, the people in and around the hotel are fantastic they open your heart. The service within the hotel is exceptional, the food, out of this world go all inc and enjoy. Don't be afraid to look around, meet the locals and experience real culture. Don't miss out. You can have the holiday of a lifetime and the chance to change peoples lives.",positive
"My husband and I got married at The Triton in May 2000. The hotel staff are very friendly and will do anything for you. The food is excellent especially the bar snacks - I got hooked on the mini spring rolls ! We're not big drinkers but I don't remember any complaints from those that were!! We found that nearly everybody staying at this hotel was either getting married or attending a wedding as a guest. This gave all the guests something in common and was a good way of getting to know people. We made some very good friends with a couple who got married the day before us and we still keep in contact with them now. The entertainment was OK but most evenings were spent around the bars chatting and making friends. First impressions of The Triton were excellent. The view from reception is breathtaking. We were greated with fresh drinks and warm face towels to freshen up after the 4 hour transfer (What an experience that was!!) The porters are there on hand to take your cases to your room. They don't expect a tip but they greet you with such genuine smiles, it's hard not to tip them. The rooms were clean and comfortable. Our room was very spacious and came complete with a stocked mini bar. We also had satellite television and constant hot water. No running up for a shower before all the other guests use the water up. We were meant to stay at The Triton for the duration of our holiday but decided to detour to The Maldives on day 7. The staff couldn't have been more accomodating about this. As we were leaving earlier, it meant that we needed our wedding pictures and video sooner than we had thought. Again, this wasn't a problem - they were waiting for us the day before we left. This is a fantastic hotel and we really loved it here. We were actually talking about going back for our anniversary next year and I only hope that all the staff in the hotel and the hotel itself are safe and well after the tragic events of Boxing Day. We've got some fantastic memories of this hotel which we will treasure for many years to come.",positive
"Me and my husband got married in the Triton Hotel Sri Lanka 3 years ago it was excellent they made us feel really special as though we where the only people to ever get married. My friend recently got married in Jamaica it was awful brides where passing each other on the way to get married, it was rushed not very nice at all. when we got married at the Triton. The hotel would not allow more than 2 weddings a day, the staff, the Guests all made us feel very special. We went back to the Triton on holiday earlier this year and although we lost our luggage and had a few problems with the flight the hotel was the same, I have stayed in other hotels in Sri Lanka some of which come a lot higher rated than the Triton but I have to say out of them all the Triton is the best, in fact I have stayed in many 5+ star hotels around the world, but have to put the Triton up at the top of my list I would go back tomorrow",positive
"Have just returned from a two week trip to Sri Lanka (Nov04) where we based ourselves at the Triton Hotel, Ahungalla. I must say although the hotel needs a overhaul ( due to be completed from May05toNov05) we had a wonderfull stay there. The food was excellant at all times. The initial room was also lovely but upon discovery of a small leak we were instantly upgraded to a suite with no questions asked by the hotel. What seemed to set the hotel apart was simply its level of service. All employees from maintenance to guest relations were excellent and couldnt do enough to help. Weddings were also a source of pleasure as the hotel puts a real show on with the dancers, elephant and evening fireworks. The only downside was the beach sellers who are quite persistent and initially put you off visiting the beach. However after a few days they recognise and it becomes far less a hassle. Altogether a lovely hotel experience for the price.",neutral
"We stayed here to have some time on the beach at the end of our holiday in August 2003. The Triton is probably the oldest in the Aitken Spence chain, but don't let that put you off as it is a good four star. On the plus side, the food is excellent and the two swimming pools by the beach are splendid. In particular there is a beautiful blue pool which is partially shaded by an enormous tree, which makes a great place to swim out of the sun. The beach is nice, but a little spoilt by the many tea shirt vendors who can be a real pain and are very persistent. Also check the time of year if you want to swim in the sea as the surf can be really huge. The staff are charming and could not be more helpful. Make sure you give them a small tip every day and you will be even better looked after. We initially had a twin room, but asked to be moved when some work was being done in the room next door and were given a much larger room, which was very nice. Lots of people get married here and the the hotel has an elephant which gets dressed up and otherwise gives free rides along the beach. 'Baby Nanu' was very, very popular with our children and ate a lot of fruit from the various kitchens. For weddings there are 'Kandy dancers' who put on a splendid show. Trips to do include a baby turtle rescue farm at Kosgoda where children can hold baby turtles before they are released in to the sea. Also there is a very good river boat ride where you will see lots of kingfishers, fish eagles, water monitors, monkeys and a Buddist monastery on an island.",positive
"I was immediately at ease, friendly and caring staff. Let’s say that Singalis have this dowry, availability and caring for the guest. So already a point in their favor, then the period is perfect, sun, clouds and one day rain, in short well. Then about the pool, rooms, services all good. As for catering, I would say exaggerated in quantity and types of dishes, for all tastes and all fresh and good. In short, this week I relaxed, rested and ate divinely, I thank the managers and all the staff who made my stay pleasant.",positive
"Spacious and well maintained rooms. The bathroom could be cleaner. The staff in general is more than friendly. Initially confusing because not used to but in the end it is very very nice. The complex is well equipped with 2 swimming pools, tennis courts. The cuisine is good, varied but spicy. I will remember the smiles of the Sri Lankan people for a long time.",positive
"great room for our part is on the sea. Team smiling and always available, Kitchen with a wide choice of Swimming pool on top. Thank you very much for this stay I highly recommend this hotel With family or group. France …..",positive
The staff is very attentive and smiling The huge buffet and for every taste pay attention to spicy dishes not always indicated Rooms are sea view Superb swimming pools I recommend the restaurant a little expensive but really perfect 3 servers for 6 people,positive

"Hello, stayed at your hotel from 06.01.2025 to 16.01.2025. We were happy with everything: 1) delicious variety of food 2) Hotel service at altitude 3) perfect daily room cleaning Many thanks to the hotel staff for responding instantly to any request and friendliness. The very location of the hotel is very successful - a large beach strip with snow-white sand, clear beach and ocean and no large number of tourists, as well as local beggars. Thank you to the hotel for your hospitality!!!",positive
"From the reception to our departure the staff of all the services were very caring. Quality food, including desserts and pastries for breakfast. Two beautiful swimming pools, one facing the sea. Very nice beach. Francophone welcome Fram warm. We enjoyed it. Excursions from the hotel with French-speaking guide insured. However, the price is high. Great vacation.",positive
"The hotel was from January 4-13, despite the high season , it was very comfortable: tables in the dining room and outside and inside are always available, sunbeds too , although we were 10 people. The food is excellent: and national food and the usual standard hotel cuisine(crabs, shrimp , fruit local eaten ). ocean with small waves , but it is only a pleasure to jump on the waves( children also bathed ) hotel is not new , but for Asia is very decent. Yes, everything is slow, but apparently the locals are trying very hard, very friendly. On the beach local merchants, but we found common ground with them, they showed us turtles who went out to lay eggs on the beach , local animals) Went on excursions with local guide Janit +94707219723 (wrote in advance of the trip , chose dates and individual excursion for 2 days in the center of the island , paid in advance upon arrival ) were very pleased , he found a great minibus , speaks Russian , everything was perfectly timed where you could not pass , put us on a tuk tuki , took super photos , all entrances and tickets included in the price . And at the price of course much more profitable than in hotels and on the spot booking. Took so tuks outside the hotel went swimming with turtles and to the beach in bentota (there surfed ), many speak Russian",positive
"Nice hotel with wonderful staff. I have never seen such friendly, kind and sympathetic communication in any country. Jayaru has captured my heart in general, she has always helped with everything. Now, on the turf, everything's fine, I can't even find the downside. We lived in the far wing and we were very quiet. Only black monkeys culturally disturbed our peace twice in 10 days 😅 the warblers behaved modestly and the chipmunks ran merrily around the grounds. The food is also delicious, shrimp, squid, chicken, fish (except beef, here it is best not to take it :))), the fruit has always been in large quantities. Ice cream 👍 Rooms are cleaned well and always smell nice after cleaning.",positive
"Vacationing with your son at this hotel in November. Really enjoyed your holiday! The hotel is wonderful! Very beautiful, clean, cozy territory. Lots of vegetation, cute, funny and harmless animals and birds that constantly delight the look! A separate delight from the monkey family!🫶😊 The hotel staff is very friendly, attentive!👍👍👍 The food is varied, delicious.The room is spacious, with a large balcony and beautiful views of the ocean and the hotel grounds! Comfortable bed! Huge, beautiful beach! Took a tour of the island through an individual guide Janita(+94 70 721 9723). Janit himself was unable to accompany us for health reasons, but found a worthy replacement. Our excursion took place at the appointed time, day, all taking into account our wishes , in a comfortable car!Swept everything that was planned, received a lot of positive emotions and new information!!! Thanks guys!!! All in all, the rest was great! I want to get back to this wonderful island!",positive
"The hotel is a little paradise! The room large and clean with a small balcony from which you could watch the monkeys on the tree opposite. The second, quieter pool with pleasantly warm water and a beautiful green area around it was very welcoming. The food was very varied. We were most pleased that there were so many typical dishes. Special thanks to Jayaru who helped us all the time. But everyone else at the staff was very friendly and always had a smile on their face. The Gala Dinner on New Year's Eve was a mega event!",positive
"In general: Architecturally very generously designed hotel complex with beautiful green areas directly on the Indian Ocean. The hotel definitely stands out from other hotels due to the friendliness and exceptional service of the staff. Thanks for letting me be part of the Heritance family for three weeks. I will definitely come back. Rooms: The rooms are larger than average and have a kettle and refrigerator in addition to the general standard. Recommended is the “laundry service”, fast, clean and inexpensive. The housekeeping was good, thanks for the towel animals or flowers on my bed. In the evening the bed was revealed, the curtains were closed and if necessary the towels were changed again. Restaurant/Bars: In the restaurant, the high level of service is noticeable. You are led to a table set with cloth napkins and bread plates at each meal. Light background music underlines the atmosphere. Thank you Duminda, the good soul of the restaurant, and thank you Jananja for the always professional service. The offer as well as the quality of the food were above average and prepared with a lot of attention to detail. Extra wishes were also gladly fulfilled. Thanks for that, Kavindu. I was lucky enough to be able to take part in the gigantic buffets on Christmas and New Year's Eve. Chapeau Keshan!!! Service: The absolute plus of the hotel is the leadership and exceptional service of the staff. You always feel welcome as a guest. Staff are always friendly. As a solo traveler, I never felt lonely, but rather as part of the hotel family. Danke an Jayaru, Guest Relations Executive. She's helped me with some of my affairs. I'm really looking forward to seeing you again. Location/surroundings. Directly in front of the hotel entrance you can take public transport or tuk tuk to the surrounding towns. Excursions I booked through Sunil. You can find him on the beach. He speaks good German and is very reliable.",positive
"Wonderful hotel, service and service at a premium, friendly and responsive staff. There was a great room, the kitchen in the restaurant is varied and for every taste. I want to thank all the staff and celebrate the girl from Jayaru reception - competent, sympathetic, always prompt and help. Happy New Year... the organization was at the top. Unequivocally, I recommend you to leave the most positive impressions of rest and stay!",positive
"The structure is beautiful, especially for the location. The common areas are from 5-star hotels, even the breakfast buffet and restaurant, international cuisine where you can find just about everything! A note for coffee / tea for breakfast that is unfortunately not buffet style and you have to wait for it to be served, often without a teaspoon... The rooms should be modernized, they remained in the 80s/90s of dark wood. In the three-bed room the third bed should be a real bed in a 5-star hotel, not a folding bed with uncomfortable mattress. Also because the third person, if he is not a child, is still paying in all respects. The staff is very kind and helpful to any request, a special thanks to Dasuni 😀",positive
"The worst hotel. I do not recommend his visit to anyone 🤦🏻‍’️ Cheating and spinning accounts. Without a statement, 20% tax is included. Why???? The manager has no plans to deal with the problems adequately, instead of explaining or at least apologizing for the negative situation , and due to the incompetence of the workers, yelling at the guests The worst hotel ever. Dirty towels, bathrobes. Old interior",negative
"At the Heritance Ahungalla you will be offered everything you want from a perfect holiday. I can only confirm the other 5 star reviews. In addition, this hotel is a good base for many interesting getaways in Sri Lanka. A great tour guide is Sunil. Please ask for Sunil on the beach. He's honest, speaks perfect German, not a vampire.",positive
"I'm in a hotel right now. Today is the fifth day. The staff are very friendly and always available to help. They communicate in English. If there's a misunderstanding, Google gets the translator. The room is cleaned perfectly every day. Save some for a tip and it'll be nice to get back to your room. The area is large, green, running chipmunks 🐿️ and with luck , you can meet a waran. I'm lucky. It's delicious and varied. The ocean is turbulent, swimming is impossible, but breathing sea air and wetting feet is a must. Special thanks to sun fun guide Anjan. A very responsible, decent man.",positive
"We rested a couple from 23.11 to 02.12, we're going home today while we wait for the bus to write a review. The hotel recommends, do not expect the delights of cuisine as in Turkey all inclusive, but always fresh. Seafood was oysters, crab, shrimp, squid. Diverse cuisine with local flavor, you won't stay hungry, sharp but delicious. Desserts are delicious. Good responsive staff who try their best to make the holiday memorable. Particular mention should be made of the manager of Kavindu and the specialist in the work with guests Jayaru, all the issues that arose were solved quickly and with quality. Thank you very much to everyone else as well, very well done, so keep going! It's great! Before you go, I recommend reading about Sri Lanka, its way of life and customs, the service is underdeveloped, but try very hard. Come, relax, admire the ocean and the wonderful nature, pay no attention or pick on the little things, do not compare your holidays here with other countries and you will be satisfied.",positive
"In some places would need to be renovated in the area of the bathroom. Pool area. Staff are friendly. At checkout at noon, the all-inclusive is cancelled. If you are picked up at night . Bad luck, we were offered a lynx package, which I had declined. Even then alone I would have given inadequately.",neutral
"great hotel!!! staff is very polite and the grounds are very beautiful ) live music in the bar, fed very delicious, we really enjoyed it. many different activities in the hotel,the exit leads directly to the ocean. Generally very nice hotel , we liked)",positive
"Very happy with the hotel! Diverse, delicious food, attentive, responsive staff! I saw the splinters in the reviews the opinion that the interior is ""tired"" - it seems there was a renovation, as in general the hotel is neat, well maintained! Perfect location - the ocean is fascinating! Yes, there are local vendors on the beach, dogs, drive to the hotel 3 hours from the airport - but! It's so small compared to the ocean experience and the pleasure of the hotel! In the evening, a varied program - more often live music!",positive
"Were there a family of four at this hotel. We booked two rooms with two people each. Since Mom had a birthday during our stay, the hotel proactively upgraded the parents' room. Instead of garden views, they had views of the main pool and the ocean. The hotel is quite remote from Colombo Airport, so it takes about 2.5 hours to get there. The location is picturesque, the area is vast. The garden is closely watched, as is the whole area. During our stay, we were gracious to the swift chipmunks, the birds of paradise, slightly afraid of the varan. No monkeys have been seen. I've even had some disappointment about it, but it's a joke. We were delighted by the abundance of dishes and all sorts of options for dinner. Fish are presented in different variations. Squid, shrimp, tuna and whitefish sashimi, crab claws and even oysters have occurred. Desserts were a particular delight. They differed from the typical desserts often seen in hotels on the buffet table. All kinds of cakes - biscuit and mousse, donuts, cookies, desserts in jars - in general, for all tastes and colors. Each breakfast has a wide range of delicious pastries and breads. Croissants are just a song. Juicy ripe fruit (especially pineapples, papayas and mini bananas, fresh greens. It's hard to stay hungry. Kitchen's an A. Cleaned up every day and did it well. If you leave a small tip, every day you will be greeted in your room by a funny arrangement of towels. Toothpaste is best taken with you, as there is not much in the set. The hotel has a gym. It's not big, the machines aren't the most modern, but there are treadmills. Among the holidaymakers are numerous represented Russians, Germans, French, Italians, Chinese. The environment is calm, not particularly noisy - good for family holidays. There is no separate animation for children as such. There was live music in the lobby every night. If you leave the hotel and walk 300 meters to the left, you can buy something from a small supermarket. Turn right - 200 meters and there's an alcohol store. Keep in mind that the price tags aren't there, so you should be brave enough to lower the price. We have determined that there is an overstatement of about Rs. 1,100-1,600 from the market value. What killed me was the constant obsessive attention and escort from the beach to the fights (from the ocean side) and the tuk-tuks as I left the hotel. Well, I'm not used to it. It's like you're being followed by paparazzi. On the ocean, he can stand with you, talk, and you can want to sit alone and see the ocean. Oh, yes, there were always waves. The difference was strength and height. But the water is warm! We fought the elements bravely. When leaving the hotel, there are individuals among the local mafia who will follow you all the way. No reason. One followed us to the store, waited for us to leave, tried to talk and drove us back to the hotel. Also, when we were buying alcohol, another comrade came with us. We took it the salesman was unbuttoning something, so we came. It kind of pissed me off. We told them to leave us alone, but it's not working. The hotel is the only point of attraction in this settlement. Apparently, this is where they expect to make money. White people are a bag of millions. But these are minor nuances that did not mar the overall positive impression. Just be prepared. The hotel our whole family recommends.",positive
"Very great hotel, me great food..highly recommended!The only downer was that the postcards that were dropped off in the hotel's own shop did not arrive. You can buy tickets there,but no stamps to it.I was then told in the shop that n. Paying the postage costs the cards are sent...unfortunately I think that's just a ploy to earn extra money .So don't fall for it too!",positive
"Great hotel. Service is high. The staff is friendly. You are greeted with sweets and freshly squeezed juices upon arrival. Clean rooms, clean grounds, clean beach. The food is delicious and varied. Warm ocean. There are monkeys running on the property.",positive
"The hotel at 5* doesn't pull at all. It needs a good repair. Rooms are good, cleaning is good. But there are nuances like a broken kettle, the doors to the balcony don't close. Strange scenery on the walls. The linens are not exactly white. There are two pools. Beautiful ocean view. People are kind, sympathetic. The food isn't very varied. A lot of it's spicy, the beef's really tough. Delicious pineapple and papaya. There was no fish variety. Amateur salads. Ice cream liked it. They gave oysters once. The shrimp is delicious. The restaurant's not big. Wifi is weak. There are no TV channels in Russian. For all the faults, you can rest here well. In food find your own, the population is very positive and simple, nature is beautiful. Just whoever is coming here will tune in to another level of service 😊 Special thanks to the hotel, for your help and special attention to us!!! Not the hotel's indifference to tourists and quick response to the issue, for that thank you so much! Thank you very much to the staff! We wish the hotel prosperity and development!",negative

"Sri Lanka is my love! Family vacation hotel. Ocean fire, pools of pure water. The rooms are super, cleaned every day. Service at the highest level. The food is varied and delicious, but peculiar. Live music every night. Jayaru is very friendly and polite at reception. She speaks Russian and understands us Russian.",positive
"The hotel is nice but the most happy thing was our friend who used to give us gifts every day. Very good staff attitude, lots of all kinds of presentations for all inclusive. We've had a good rest in this place and we'll be back sometime.",positive
"How and where should I start!? We were on Sri Lanka for the first time. the country the island, a green paradise. The hotel was paradise, all wishes were fulfilled. The food that was available to you all day was a force. The pools and gardens were well maintained and the rooms were restored to order 100% daily by angel hands. The staff really knows how to sweeten the stay. All in all, 150% recommended!!!!",positive
"The hotel is nice, especiallywm in a quiet location. Rooms are nice and always very clean. Many thanks to everyone here, whether nursery, roomboys, poolboys, ladies from the spa or the many staff! You always have a smile for your guests, that's what I wish for in Germany! The only thing I could complain about is no make-up mirror in the bathroom and too many mixing at the bar,as every drink tastes different,although it should be the same.why can't 2 solid bar mixers always mix to make it the same. You also make a lot of effort to create a nice ambience on the beach, with bar, dinner and fire, but unfortunately, there is no rush to go as you have to pay for it. They'd rather sit at the AI Bar. Maybe you should make it free to make the effort worthwhile. One more note, please play other songs. We have now 14 days always heard the same songs every night!!",positive
"Were at this hotel from October 30 to November 9. Traveling with Anex, very lucky to have a hotel representative - Nina. Thank her very much! The hotel is wonderful, the staff is very friendly and responsive. Every day there are different activities: aqua aerobics, volleyball, yoga, etc. In the evenings live music. The food is delicious and varied. Every day there are fish, seafood, fruit (watermelons, bananas, pineapples, etc.) The hotel is on the first line, but since it is an ocean, there is always a wave and a green flag.",positive
"We've had nine nights off since November 1. The weather was happy, the ocean is warming!! The hotel is quiet and peaceful. Not party!! The food is good, there's always choice, and spicy and ordinary food. All in all, clean, cozy, but didn't notice much chic either. Staff are polite and considerate, everyone smiles all the time!)",positive
"Been alone with his wife for two weeks. Overall, the impression is good. The hotel is large, the food is quality, but you have to get used to it, the staff is smiley, the linen is clean and fresh, the towels are changed frequently and everything is very neat. Cleaning is quick and thorough. Beach loungers with mattresses and clean towels give out every morning. The local population is a little obsessive, but staff and security are not allowed in. The beach is large and clean although sometimes there are difficulties entering the water because you must not forget that it is the ocean, high waves. The holiday was brightened by a local boy, Nalim, a very responsible and pleasant young man. It offers tourist activity by the hotel on the beach. Accompanied us throughout our 13 days of rest. On the first day they told him about our holiday wishes and he planned everything and arranged all transfers, be it travel in a comfortable car or local travel by knock knock. Organised quality trips to local attractions for which he is very grateful. Every day I enjoyed coconuts and a good mood.",positive
"Heritance Ahungalla offers a fantastic experience with excellent service and luxurious facilities. The staff is friendly and helpful, the rooms are spacious and clean, and the food is really top notch. The pool is beautiful, and the restaurant offers delicious, varied cuisine. Perfect for those looking for relaxation and luxury!",positive
"We encountered very friendly and attentive staff during our stay. The hallways, pool's and rooms were always very clean. Room service did a meticulous job and delighted us daily with new funny towel figures. The large pools were cleaned daily and were always clean even without chlorine. Unfortunately, during our stay, due to the strong surf, we could not use the hotel's own beach. The staff will provide friendly and authentic information on all questions. The beautiful country and the warmth of the Sinhalese will remain in our fond memories for a long time to come. Claudia, Tessa and Olaf",positive
"The hotel is located directly on the beach and offers all the amenities you wish for. Particularly noteworthy is the friendliness of the entire staff . The food was rich and varied. No matter what meal we had, we were always more than full. We all booked our excursions with Sunil and also spent with him. He speaks good German and tries to fulfill all the wishes of the guests. Just ask the locals about him on the beach - definitely worth it.",positive
"14 days spent in a beautiful country, in a hotel that is absolutely typical of the country. No luxury, but Clean u the friendliest staff you can imagine 💝 I was traveling alone u never had to be afraid at any time. At least not in the hotel... Once I tried to go across the street to a kiosk, this should not be done alone! At least not as a woman 🫣 Unfortunately, it is not common in the hotel to sit outside on a terrace at meals. After a friendly request to the staff, however, this was made possible! We (I had met a married couple) had a table outside every morning and night. A very special thanks, goes here to Navidu 🙏 My room was not the newest but always tip top clean 🧽👌🤩 Thanks to Rukmal🙏 Suggestions for improvement... The food is unfortunately usually only lukewarm... Again, after two days you have got used to it, it is just different from Europe. All around one of my most beautiful places I have visited, I will definitely come back.",positive
"Highly recommended. Very friendly, warm and courteous staff. Greetings to Chamuditha and Manduranga. You have enriched our vacation. Great beach location and two large pools with ample space. Great choice at every meal with delicious food. Rooms are clean and very spacious. Delicious cocktails at the pool bar to take full advantage of the all inclusive package:) All in all a very nice place, we will gladly come back.",positive
"We enjoyed a welcome drink after arrival until it was time to check in, had lunch and then checked in at 2pm. I am very comfortable with the room being upgraded. Samka, a tour company introduced by the hotel, took us to the finish line and picked us up from the airport. He was a very nice person and I asked him to drop us off and pick us up safely. full board During my stay, I ate breakfast, lunch and dinner at the hotel buffet and many staff members such as Nuwan cared about me and I enjoyed eating too. If you ask for something, it will come out very slowly, so you should ask for anything early, because it will be Sri Lanka time.",positive
We spent 17 days at this hotel. The extraordinarily lovable helpful staff made our stay very embellished. We would particularly like to thank Executive Sous Chef Lakmal Chathuranga and Pastry Chef Cavinda Heshan and team for the excellent cuisine. The bar manager Kalinga Jayasekava and his team have always cared for the guests lovingly. The room cleaning and facilities were very good. Trilishiya received us warmly at the hotel and always had an open ear with concerns.,positive
"Overnight on tour. They said it was five stars, but there was no toothbrush or slippers. Shampoo is contained in a ceramic container, making it difficult to use. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, the location is great! The food buffet is not so different from other hotels. The staff are kind. Finally, after I went on a hotel tour, they took my phone away from me because it was a survey. I logged into Google without permission and the hotel staff ticked all the good ratings. The receptionist female staff had asked us to only include comments, but the male staff were surprised when they closed the box and returned without comment after checking all the good boxes. It was an incident that made me think you didn't know what you were doing or you were mocking me.",negative
"An excellent hotel for relaxation, family, reboot. Beautiful views, green area, 2 clean swimming pools, sun loungers. Friendly, smiling staff. Even if you don’t understand English, they will translate, help, and advise. Your request will not go unnoticed. Thank you very much to the administrator Dulaj - a kind, sympathetic guy who resolved all organizational issues regarding accommodation throughout the entire vacation. Excellent restaurant, the food is varied and tasty, there is always fresh fruit. The waiters are caring and attentive. No swimming on the beach - big waves. But it is possible to use tuk tuk services, which are located next to the hotel, to get to the nearest lagoon. We accidentally met Ira, who speaks Russian. He took us for a ride along the nearby coast, showed us lagoons, a beach with turtles, interesting shops where you can buy jewelry, textiles, spices, tea. It turned out to be a good mini excursion. We exchanged phone numbers, wrote in advance when and where needed, and he drove up to the hotel. If you decide to take a ride in a tuk tuk, you won't regret calling one. I’ll leave the number, maybe someone will find it useful +94 77 664 1538. In the evening there is live music, there were fire performances and national dances. At 23:00 everything stops and you can go to bed. Everything here is amazing - colorful nature, Buddha statues, wildlife, differently organized traffic, crazy buses, water flushing counterclockwise :)",positive
"A wonderful hotel for a family holiday! It’s very safe with a child) delicious food, clean and comfortable rooms, clean pool, well-groomed beach by the ocean, incredibly nice staff!!!! It was a great 10 days!!! We will definitely come back again and again!)",positive
"Another lovely holiday. The room with a sea view is highly recommended. The beds are unique and a good night's sleep is guaranteed. The food in the coffee shop is very good and fresh. The pool is unique with a view of the sea. Unfortunately the music at the bar in the evening was very loud, a little quieter would have been more pleasant. All the staff are very friendly and they have once again contributed to an unforgettable holiday. Thank you very much for that. Api obava naevata dann balaporuttu venavata.",positive
"The hotel was booked by Russians, the young generation behaved suspiciously, the employees have an internal tipping mafia, in September you can't swim in the sea, it's impossible to walk out of the hotel - you'll be harassed by the locals, excursions are expensive and the tour guide takes the customer to shops that rip you off, I don't understand why some people go on holiday there three times",negative
"We felt totally at home from the first minute. Warm welcome, our rooms were ready shortly after we arrived (early). We had a spacious and very nice room. The pools were clean, one pool was shallower and more suitable for children and the other was more for those who like peace and quiet. Unfortunately the waves were very strong and you could only go into the sea to a limited extent. The beach is a dream! The food was always delicious and varied. All the staff were nice and always in a good mood. The hotel is very suitable for children! The spa area is also very nicely decorated and highly recommended, the girls do a great job. We'll be back! Ayubowan",positive
"Wonderful hotel! Excellent cuisine, lots of fruit, breakfast is quite standard and tasty, dinner is great, something new every time!! The rooms are very clean, cleaned every day, every day we were greeted from the beach by various figures - thanks to Rukmal!) The beach area is wide, the beach itself is clean, the sunset is long, but just right for big waves)",positive
"Good hotel. No frills, like most hotels in Sri Lanka, but here we must take into account the general situation with hotels on the island. Beautiful in architecture, green, safe, the staff tries very hard to make guests feel comfortable. For guides for individual excursions with a good car, I recommend Janita (+94 70 721 9723)",positive
"The hotel is very tired. Everything in my room worked, but everything was a little shabby and shabby - both the furniture and the plumbing. And even the ponds with lotuses and carp behind the hotel - if they were at least cleaned, it would be a completely different feeling. The food is beyond praise. There wasn’t much to eat around anyway, but in the hotel - if you take national cuisine - huge portions and very tasty. The staff tries to solve your problems, but not quickly. The cleaning is lousy, whether you leave a tip or not, it doesn’t affect the amount of sand on the floor. The hotel always had free sun loungers, which the staff will put where you need them upon request. There are a lot of different animals on the territory - monitor lizards, palm squirrels, funny birds. And also a skinny cat and two very cute dogs (the latter, however, were chased by the staff). Monkeys walk on the roofs, but they are also chased, it is not so easy to see them. The beach is public, but given the location it is mostly deserted. At the exit from the hotel to the beach there are annoying merchants, and you feel like you are alone on the coast. The entrance to the water is perfect fine sand. There were always waves, occasionally strong, so not everyone could swim. There are nuances, but overall it’s a good hotel, although of course it barely reaches 4.",neutral
"We vacationed with friends from 02/12/24 to 02/19/2024. The hotel is super, I don’t know who writes angry reviews. You need to understand that this is Asia. The hotel is very clean, they cleaned and changed towels every day. There are only 2 bars, one is always empty, unfortunately, the second bar always has delicious cocktails and beer (beer is so-so, like lemonade), but whiskey and cola is super. The waiters are very attentive; in general, Sri Lankans themselves are very kind. When it comes to food, you won’t be left hungry; be sure to try the oysters, incredibly tasty. There are many Russians, 70-80 percent, the rest are Europeans, but everyone is very cultured, no one bothers anyone. There was a lot of security; once I was going to the beach to visit friends at night, the security escorted me to make sure I was not alone. The ocean is gentle, the waves are just super, I don’t know who needs a lagoon, the ocean without waves is a lake😁 on excursions: here they are trying to deceive our brother everywhere. Valuables just speak from their heads. We went to Kandy with Kamal, I’ve attached the number. He speaks Russian and charged us for an individual session, less than what we were charged for a group session. +940776085334. Lobster at the hotel was expensive. He even offered to buy it and fry it for free in a cafe from his friends.",positive
"Good afternoon. I’m not a fan of leaving reviews and, in principle, too lazy to do this, however, after certain nuances, I still decided to write. I have been vacationing with my wife since the beginning of August in this hotel through the tour operator Anex Tour. After reading positive reviews and looking at beautiful photos on booking, we decided to go to this hotel without hesitation, it didn’t even bother us that it was not the season and that there were big waves on the side where the hotel is located at that time. In general, I'll start with the positives. Namely: the hotel is located among palm trees and many trees on which small chipmunks jump and beautiful birds fly, the beach is very large and wide, the length is about 3.5 km, but it is cleaned only directly in front of the hotel in the morning from among local vigilantes. which are photographed by a local police officer upon completion of work. The 5-star Heritance Hotel has: 2 swimming pools, one small gym, restaurant, one bar. That's basically all the advantages.) I don’t want to be a boring person in your eyes, so that you don’t think: “Well, there are people who always don’t like something.” Because I thought so myself when I read several similar reviews before buying the tour. Arriving at the hotel, we were greeted by girls with white smiles. I was very pleased with the positive mood of the staff, always smiling. Always. But, as it turned out, from fulfilling my professional tasks of maintaining a comfortable client accommodation, this was the only well-developed skill. Simply put, in addition to the fact that the hotel is over 60 years old, its technical condition leaves much to be desired. Apart from the smell of “grandmother’s sofa in the country,” no one plans to refresh the hotel and monitor its cleanliness, order in the premises, rooms, glass washing and sanitary disinfection! On the first day we arrived and entered the room, I noticed that the drain in the shower was clogged and the flush in the toilet did not work well enough to fulfill its function. Going down to the restaurant, I am not a squeamish and meticulous person, I was not pleasantly surprised that the tables were simply sticky, like in a dumpling shop! The window glass is incredibly dirty and there are flies flying around the room and landing on your plate. My wife cried when she saw it all... she was in a terrible mood. Not once, not once during all the time were there paper napkins on the table. pepper shakers and salt shakers were very rarely found on tables. But what struck me and other visitors from Europe most of all was that 95% of the dishes were incredibly spicy! A couple of days before departure, I couldn’t resist and asked to see salads and hot dishes without “curry” and “black pepper”. I would NEVER call the restaurant a restaurant. They greet you beautifully, open the doors, smile, BUT the food and service are below par! After eating, you need to wait until the receipt is closed, and sign the zero receipt, indicating that you do not owe any money for the drinks. Yes, yes, even if you have “all inclusive”, even if you drank cola or local arak is free. The check takes a very long time. I left a lot of tips, but they still don’t want to work. On the opposite side of the so-called “restaurant” with flies, sticky tables, dirty glass, there is a bar. Where can you buy alcohol, fries and a burger. Most of the time we ate there, there is no spicy food at all! The all-inclusive option includes the above items and local alcoholic drinks. Everything else is paid. He works a couple of hours before lunch and an hour after for cooking. By the way, after 24.00 it is impossible to drink cola, whiskey or smoke a pack of cigarettes. Everything in the hotel is closed. Outside the hotel, shops are closed after zero hours. For leisure, near the bar with paid drinks there is an area where a local musician plays until 23.00. Near the exit to the ocean, local traders and beggars are constantly on duty. Security guards do not allow them into the territory, but they watch you through a mesh fence when you go swimming at the beach. It looks funny, because you are 7-10 meters away on the sun loungers by the pool towards the ocean, you see them, and they look at you) they look at you, and you look at them) like in a zoo, it’s not clear just who the animal is. The staff is very very lazy, no matter what anyone writes that they are trying. It is not true. While you give me a tip, they pretend. Sooo slow, very, very slow. And, of course, I couldn’t help but pay attention to the staff’s manicure and pedicure; this is a separate topic. There was a great desire to give nail scissors. My appeal and review was sent not to criticize, but so that the management would take note and work on the mistakes. Because if you oppose yourself as 5 stars, then correspond, be so kind! But the bosses only taught me to smile and bow. P.S. On the day of departure, our flight was postponed several times. From early morning the hotel staff saw us sitting and waiting for our bus, but at 12.00 when we handed over our bracelets, we became a different kind of people. At 12.10, the wife asked the hostess for 2 free bottles of water to take with her to the airport, which they usually bring to the room, to which she replied with a smile: “and now it’s paid!” I was so amazed that I thought it was a joke, since I only didn’t tip chipmunks. In general, thanks to the ocean and the cool chipmunks, they did not disappoint us.",positive
"Great hotel, polite staff, convenient location. Pleasant and warm sea within walking distance. The cleaner in the room was very attentive and always listened to our wishes and brought everything we asked for. During our vacation we saw monkeys, monitor lizards, many birds, squirrels and chipmunks, and all this without leaving the hotel",positive
"Hello . The hotel left a mixed impression, we stayed here from 02/03/24 to 02/12/24 Ocean 5+ (if you are afraid of waves like me, then 35 minutes along the beach and you are in a dream lagoon without waves) Kitchen 5+ Live music every evening 5+ The restaurant also has music for weekend dinners 5+ Cleaning 5+ cleaner Rukmal best every day did really masterpieces! Pool 5+, service 5+, atmosphere 5+ the hotel is really very good, the monkeys running on the balconies are just super. The worst ROOM 🤦‍♀️ 1+ or 2+ I think you can’t move into such rooms by any means. I'll attach a photo. Everything is falling apart, electrical wires are sticking out, the socket is barely there, everything is old and terrible, number 230 is terrible 🤦 ♀️ A 3 star hostel is better. We tried not to make the room creepy 🤪 Take the better room category and you will be happy 🙌🏼",negative
"All liked it ! We rested for 10 days from 01/30/24 We took breakfast, but it’s better to take it with dinner, because there are 1-2 restaurants within walking distance. We always had dinner at a restaurant on the beach (right: white villa). The average price for a dish is 2500 rupees. Delicious, large portions The advantages of the hotel: Beautiful pool The ocean always has waves, but you can swim Breakfast is good, there is a lot to choose from They clean the room and change towels every day There are monitor lizards and monkeys on the territory Of the minuses: The reception itself is not very friendly and customer-oriented The location of the hotel is both a plus and a minus, everything is very quiet and clean, but there is nothing nearby. You need to take a bus / tuk tuk / taxi to Hikkaduwa (20 minutes) / to Bentota (20 minutes) One liquor store nearby, prices higher than in Hikkaduwa.",positive
"We spent a pleasant holiday as a family with a one-year-old baby. Service and attention at a high level. The hotel staff pays attention to every guest, especially the little ones. For kids, you can ask for special food: they prepared vegetables and crushed potatoes for us. The menu is very varied: meat, fish, fried, grilled, boiled seafood; local food, European food - for every taste and spiciness. Many thanks to supervisor Chamuditha - an attentive manager who helped organize special meals for the baby and in general feel very comfortable and surrounded by care 😊 The hotel area is small, neatly decorated and filled with different animals: monkeys, monitor lizards, chipmunks, birds - it’s interesting to watch them. There are 2 swimming pools on the territory - one is noisier and one is quieter. The rooms are a bit old, but clean. Every day they clean and change towels. Overall nice. The ocean is not calm - but the best thing is to ride the waves - they are not bigger and not small. There was never a calm ocean during our stay; you only need to drive about 10 minutes to the nearest bay if you want to swim. They organize excursions to suit every taste, but the main attractions are a bit far away. Hotel guests are mainly from Europe and Kazakhstan. Cool place for a relaxing family holiday 🔥",positive
"The hotel was built in the early 1980s in the Sri Lankan style. Helpful and nice service, trouble-free contact in English. Rooms clean and spacious. A good base for trips to the most important attractions of the region. The swimming pool is clean and well-kept. No problems with sunbeds in January/February. There is a wide beach next to the hotel with a flat entrance to the ocean. I would highly recommend!",positive
"The hotel is terrible!!! How can you like the ruined rooms, old dirty towels, sun loungers that are falling apart!!! The service is terrible, they try to cheat at every step!!!! At the bar we ordered Black rum Bacardi, they brought it local for the price of Bacardi and also included service for what????????? Because they tried to sell local alcohol at the price of imported alcohol!!!! They also added 18% tax to the price indicated in the price list. It's not worth the money, it won't spoil your holiday by staying in this hotel!!!!",negative
"We have been to some places in Italy, Greece, Spain… But this place… we fell in love. The best food, the best staff. Especially Mr. Chamuditha!!! Professional, clean, nice. Full help! Time slows down here and your heart burns. I definitely love this place and the people here. 11/10.",positive
"I had a great holiday with my parents at Heritance Ahungalla. This hotel was built by the famous architect G.Bawa and it has its own unique charm and charm. It is ideal for a relaxing holiday; for those who go on vacation to swim, enjoy nature, and read books. Beach: amazingly beautiful beach with sand as soft as flour. It was very fun to jump on the waves in the Indian Ocean. You must understand that almost all beaches in Sri Lanka are municipal, so they are not equipped, and local residents will approach you to offer excursions, etc. but they are friendly and not particularly pestering. The beach is clean and the lack of infrastructure in the form of sun loungers makes it worse. Pools: The hotel has two very large and beautiful swimming pools. The weather and water temperature allow you not to get out of them at all. There are plenty of sun loungers by the pool and in the garden. There's always room. Room: we lived in room 303, a very large, beautiful room, there was a shower and a bathroom. Everything in the room works. The furniture is beautiful. Upon check-in, I received a compliment from the hotel - fruits and sweets. Cleanliness: everything is very clean, the room is cleaned every day. I liked the towel elephant (pictured) Animation: every evening there was live music or a show in the bar. I really enjoyed the fire show and the traditional Sri Lankan dance show. There is not much animation during the day Language: I speak English fluently, so I could easily communicate with the staff. For those who don’t know English at all, it may be a little difficult, since few people speak Russian. Food: delicious and varied food. There is Indian and local food (spicy), as well as European options - grilled chicken, pork, etc. There is fish and seafood - crabs, shrimp, squid, etc. The only note is this: my parents and I mostly like to drink wine. Here it is served only for lunch and dinner (in unlimited quantities). The rest of the time, beer, cocktails and strong alcohol are available at the bar. Location: There is practically nothing within walking distance from the hotel. But we didn’t want to go anywhere. The weather was gorgeous and we enjoyed swimming all day long. I recommend going on the Bentota River Safari. It's a 30-minute tuk-tuk ride from the hotel, and the excursion itself lasts 2 hours by boat. Very beautiful mangroves, small crocodiles, monkeys, various birds. The excursion was organized for us by Nimal, whom we met on the beach. Honest and polite guide. I can confidently recommend him. His number is +94779118912. Territory: the territory is very beautiful and well-groomed. I really liked the lotuses. A whole family of cool monkeys live here, and we also saw an iguana, a lot of chipmunks and beautiful birds.",positive

"Wonderful hotel: proximity to the ocean, caring staff, delicious and varied food, availability of a gym. In terms of service, I am most grateful to Rukmal for the cleanliness of the room and wonderful surprises in the form of fresh flowers, cute notes and gorgeous animals made from towels.",positive
"I wanted to express my gratitude to Rukmal for the purity that he creates. For incredible towel figures that lift your spirits and make you smile. I have only seen such a variety of figures here. And thank you for the delicious treats for breakfast, lunch and dinner. And the greatest admiration was caused by the oysters. Here I ate them in abundance. Prosperity to you and deep gratitude.",positive
"Pros: 1. Nice staff, ready to help in all matters (if you give them a tip, and they expect it). 2. Beautiful area with many animals (monkeys, palm squirrels, monkeys) 3. Nice pools Minuses: 1. All rooms located around the lobby are forced to listen to VERY loud music until 11-12 pm (our beds literally almost vibrated). We had to move further away because it was impossible to rest. 2. The choice of food only seems large, the spiciness is not indicated anywhere, so you had to take it at random. There is nothing at all for children. If you have stomach problems, you will have nothing to choose from. In fact, the only fruits were papaya, pineapple and unleavened watermelons. Sometimes I have bananas for breakfast. 3. The staff in the dining room is very slow - drinks were sometimes brought by the end of the meal 4. You should not take excursions from the guys on the beach - they will charge you twice as much and will try to take you to every place where they have a kickback. It's better to leave the hotel and negotiate with the tuk-tukers there. 5. To get to the ocean you need to break through a crowd of very intrusive locals who are trying to push everything on you - by the end of your vacation it’s already starting to irritate you. Not a minus of the hotel itself, but you won’t be able to swim in the ocean - the waves are quite shallow. No one has change, so count on it and change it for small money right away, otherwise you will also overpay.",neutral
The food is delicious and the staff is very helpful. The surroundings are beautiful. The rooms are very clean and are cleaned well. The holiday was simply wonderful all around and we didn't miss anything.,positive
"I really liked the hotel: quiet, calm, comfortable. Actually, that's what we wanted. Attentive staff, made you feel very welcome. The room was cleaned every day. The rooms are not super new, but everything is there and everything works. Apart from the hotel and along the ocean coast there is nowhere to walk - the village, but in fact we were warned and we were ready for this. There are always free sun loungers. You can't really swim in the ocean - waves. You can jump on the waves)). You can swim in the lagoon, but you have to walk 3 km along the beach or take a tuk tuk for 100 rubles with our money. The food is great. Every day seafood: crabs, shrimp, fish, and regular food for every taste. Be careful - a lot of spicy food! Fruit daily: pineapples. passion fruit. bananas, watermelon, papaya, carambola. Overall I recommend it, I liked everything.",positive
"An excellent hotel for a relaxing holiday with the whole family. Excellent service, excellent service, very varied food. A large selection of dishes for both children and lovers of European or local cuisine. A lot of seafood, fruits, a wide variety of hot dishes and salads. At Christmas the organization exceeded all our expectations. 3 huge halls with an incredibly wide variety of dishes and drinks! The animation and service are simply top notch! Beautiful beach with a clean, gentle entrance. The ocean has no competition! Lots of different animals in the garden. Monkeys, chipmunks, monitor lizards. Exotic in a word. Special thanks to waiters Dilusha and Bakhtiya. Super customer oriented. I would also like to mention the guide Pawar, who speaks excellent Russian and excursions with him are simply incredibly interesting. Will always help with solving any questions.

"I vacationed in Sri Lanka for the first time, at the Heritage Ahungalla hotel from December 6 to 17, 2023, in room 234 overlooking the ocean and pool. And I’m very glad that I ended up in this cozy hotel. If you are very tired, I recommend coming here to recover. Because there will be a feeling of care and comfort. You can constantly hear the sound of the ocean, it helps to calm frayed nerves, warm sun, colorful nature, beautiful weather. The restaurant has delicious and varied food (seafood, local exotics with curry, and European). The room has a comfortable bed and pillows, high-quality bed linen, which was constantly changed. Good WI-FI signal throughout the hotel, it’s very convenient!!! Warm ocean, sandy entrance, no urchins, no jellyfish, no fish, no stones and other things. But throughout the entire vacation there were constantly waves in the ocean that tried to drag you away, so you have to be very careful and don’t forget about safety!!! The hotel has 2 swimming pools, a garden with flowers and chipmunks, stunning sunsets, silence and tranquility. Local and Indian cuisine is a table with familiar dishes such as soups and pasta, there is always fish, seafood, and meat. Ripe fruits: pineapple, watermelon, passion fruit, papaya, bananas, other local seasonal ones. Chef and kitchen team, all the waiters, I sincerely thank you for your great contribution to my vacation 😘 Thanks to all the room boys for the clean room, the twisted figures made from towels made me laugh a lot)) it was nice, thank you. I went on 2 individual excursions (2-day excursion: Kandy + Nuwara city + Ambuluwawa Tower + Ella city + Waterfall and 1 day excursion: Galle city + Wijaya Beach) with a wonderful Russian-speaking guide Janit (Tel.: +94 70 721 97 23) who turned out to be not only a professional in his field, but also a wonderful person. The car for the trip was clean and comfortable. Recommendation: if you get motion sickness on mountain serpentine roads, take anti-nausea pills!!! I would like to express my sincere gratitude and appreciation for the perfectly organized tour, educational and interesting stories about the culture and history of Sri Lanka. Janit was very attentive to questions and wishes, and was always ready to offer alternative route options. Janit took wonderful photos and videos to remember. Overall, I am very pleased with how our excursions in Sri Lanka went and I think that this is largely due to the guide. I can confidently recommend Janit to anyone who wants to get vivid impressions and unforgettable emotions from traveling around Sri Lanka.",positive

"I have never written reviews about my travels, but I would like to leave a review about our recent trip with words of gratitude to a very good person. At the end of November this year, my wife and I vacationed in Ahungalla, the southern province of Sri Lanka, at the Heritance Ahungalla hotel, where Anjana Maduranga (Fun&Sun Tour Operator) works as a hotel guide. We liked Anjana immediately upon our first meeting: he is a pleasant and friendly person, he is attentive to tourists, he provides all the information in great detail and intelligibly, he talks about excursions very professionally, you can always contact us with any question at any time. I ask management to pay attention to this guide and note his excellent work and knowledge! More such employees. There were only positive impressions left. Thank you for a wonderful holiday.",positive
"We rested in this hotel in November 2023, we really liked the hotel, the food was varied, in the restaurant we were periodically entertained with music, there were various seafood products, I really liked the oysters in this hotel) the rooms were large, they were cleaned every day. people are very nice. We took all inclusive and were not disappointed, because it was very convenient. We couldn’t find anywhere to eat outside the hotel, or we didn’t look well. It would probably be necessary to go somewhere by tuk-tuk. The ocean was exciting in November. The beach in Sri Lanka is public, so there are sellers of beachwear on the beach, they try to get you to buy something from them, but they react to refusal without offense, then they offer again) there is a guy on the beach who offers trips on a tut-tuk There are several of them out there, but Siri was recommended to us by the guys and somehow he inspired us the most confidence. A nice nice guy, he took us to Bentota and bought some tea. He offered it on turtles and in shops and in the park and anywhere and everywhere he waited for $10. He can help organize excursions, my husband and I were thinking of going to Kandy village and the Temple of the Tooth Relic, with stops at various places along the way with this Siri in a Toyota car for $250, but I got sick and the trip was unfortunately canceled for us. A one-day excursion from the tour operator seemed to cost $90, but I think it’s not easy to take a bus and wait for everyone there. In general, I really liked the Hotel.",positive
"The shortcomings that the hotel now has are more than compensated for by the service staff! The entire staff is always very nice and helpful. You are a happy guest here and are very well looked after. A special thank you to Dilsha, the good soul of the house 😊👍 PS: Many rooms are currently being renovated. Unfortunately, unrenovated rooms are only 3* standard 😕",positive
"Good afternoon We wanted to share our impressions of our stay at the Heritance Ahungalla 5* hotel (Sri Lanka) We really liked the hotel. Rooms: The rooms are very large. Comfortable. Cleaning is done every day and very efficiently. The room has a kettle, tea, coffee, sugar, milk powder, water, refrigerator, hair dryer, shampoo, shower gel, body lotion, toothbrushes, slippers, bathrobes. Hotel: the hotel area is very clean and well maintained. The hotel is located right on the ocean. Very quiet and peaceful. Very long coastline. Meals: we only had breakfast. The food is good. We had lunch and dinner at the hotel's Alya Carte restaurant. The only negative of the restaurant is the small selection of dishes. But everything we didn’t try was very tasty. The waiters were always attentive, polite, and neat. Animation: every evening there was live music in the lobby. Artists came, danced, and put on a fire show. During the day there was water aerobics. Water polo and some other games) Beach: the hotel is located right on the ocean. There were huge waves during our holiday. But we really liked it. We spent all our time in the water) if you walk along the beach to the left, there will be a lagoon. There were no waves there at all. Infrastructure outside the hotel: there is nowhere to go. There is the only store in Sri Lanka with prices - food city. You can also buy fruits and alcohol. There is a clothing store and a jewelry store. We took a tuk here and went to the beach club restaurant. It's right on the ocean. Menu in Russian. Everything is very delicious. And the staff is just wonderful. There is also a restaurant if you walk along the beach to the left. Jungle beach. We are very glad that we chose this hotel. A very quiet and cozy place where you can relax from the hustle and bustle",positive
"An excellent hotel for a quiet holiday. Located in the village of Ahungalla. The infrastructure around is not very developed, you have to drive, but there won’t be any problems with that either, there are plenty of tuk-tuks. for a small fee - anywhere. Near the hotel, a gang of local taxi drivers and “outsiders” are lynched on the spot. With some disadvantages of the location, all are compensated by the gorgeous ocean views. As for food: it’s impossible to eat local food, but the hotel has plenty of European food, although the guys who were traveling with us occasionally couldn’t find non-spicy food (I didn’t have such problems), on weekends the food is super chic due to the fact that a lot of people come there local. Excursions: I highly recommend not taking group excursions from a hotel guide; we went on a one-day trip and it was not far in distance, but it was hell. Everything is set up to sell you something, to push a packed bus to the limit, and stuff like that. But by chance, we were recommended a local Russian-speaking (surprisingly good) guide - he arranges individual excursions. Name is Janit, (+94 70 7219723). This is what I can recommend without any pitfalls. In terms of cost, it turned out to be the same as a group excursion, but there is no comparison. It's just a delight. We took a one-day excursion - Yala National Park, Ravana Falls, Little Adam's Peak, tea plantations, nine-arch bridge and train (how can you not ride the most Instagrammable train in Sri Lanka). And at every moment Janit organized everything in such a way that it was like fire. For example, the train was 2.5 hours late, and all the tourists were waiting (almost no one waited), and Janit contacted someone in advance, found out, while we were calmly driving to the waterfall, Adam's Peak, had lunch and arrived 10 minutes before the train arrived. The tourists were all spat on and almost no one waited. We were traveling on an empty train and no one stopped us from taking photos/videos. Again, we got into the station earlier and got off 2 later, where the driver was already waiting. In general, if you want to get high on an excursion and not get stressed out among a crowd of people for the same money, I recommend it. By the way, he has an Instagram (@sri_lanka_unawatuna_tours). About the flight: the Red Wings were flying... this is of course not quite the bottom, but still. The Boeing 777 was old, but it didn’t create a particularly negative feeling (positive either), they arrived and thank God. They are trying to compensate with service. In general, ok. Mattala Airport is a gdp and a barn, in a nutshell. Sooooo long at passport control. Among the useful life hacks - be sure to buy a SIM card at the airport. 4$ and for the entire duration of the trip there are no problems with communication and the Internet. Social networks and instant messengers traffic is not taken into account, the rest is 30GB/month. It’s also convenient to change money into local tugriks at the airport, good exchange rate. There’s nothing obvious to highlight, we didn’t have any special expectations, the ocean was super warm and restless, it almost always rained at night, which in general wasn’t particularly annoying. Recommended overall.",positive
Good hotel and service. The staff is friendly and willing to help with any questions. We went on holiday with friends - we really enjoyed it. An excellent hotel for a relaxing holiday. Special menus and live entertainment are offered on Fridays and weekends. Live music at dinner),positive
"We stayed at this hotel for the first time in 40 years. We were surprised that it was just as clean as when we first visited. The rooms are very clean and the air conditioning works very well and is easy to regulate. What particularly struck us was the extremely friendly service in all areas. Starting with the helpful receptionist Mintha, all the restaurant staff, especially Rukmal, and our room attendant Duminda, who also worked very well and excellently. The food was sometimes very good (at weekends) to good. Only the cold breakfast buffet was meager, with almost no sausage or cheese. There was never an a la carte option. Instead, there were stations for every meal where you could get freshly prepared lamb, pork or chicken. The sauces were excellent. The only downside was that the Heritance Ahungalla has become a Russian hotspot, which is why I would think twice about going there again despite the good hotel.",positive
"My family and I vacationed in Sri Lanka in November in this luxurious hotel. It is wonderful and has a gorgeous view of the ocean. We could call a taxi from the hotel and we decided to go to the shopping center which was located in Colombo. Thanks to fate that we came across such a luxurious a driver named Sampa, with whom we spoke in English and visited a lot of beautiful places: turtle beach, Little Adam's Peak, nine-arch bridge and even a Safari Park with many interesting animals. Sampa was always interested in whether we liked everything and whether everything was fine with us. The most pleasant thing awaited my family and me at the end, Sampa gave us a large box of mangoes that flew a long distance from Sri Lanka to Samara. Thank you very much Sampa for what you did our vacation is even better. You became not just a guide and driver for us, but also a very good friend. We will definitely return to climb the big Adam’s Peak)",positive
"The first time was in Sri Lanka with my husband and daughter. We really enjoyed . Everything is fine. Excellent hotel, food, very friendly staff. gorgeous ocean. We also somehow called a taxi to the hotel, we wanted to go to Colombo to the shopping center and were lucky enough to meet a great guy named Sampa after this trip, he practically became our guide and tour guide around the island. He showed us the Nine Arches Bridge, Galle Fort, Adam's Peak, Yala Safari Park, swings, waterfall. In short, it was wonderful. I wholeheartedly recommend this hotel and the private transfer and tour guide Sampa.",positive
"Very good hotel! The lobby is designed as a hall. The hotel is located on the seaside and has its own beach. At dusk, the sunset over the Indian Ocean is a highlight. However, how could there be salesmen mixed in on the beach? This is a disadvantage. The room is large in size, as is the bathroom, with complete equipment. One week after arriving in Sri Lanka, this is the first hotel to provide indoor slippers. There are many TV channels to choose from. There are channels in major languages in the world, which should be able to meet the needs of travelers from different countries. This time, we had all three meals at the hotel. There were quite a few choices of food and beverages, and the quality was also of a certain level. However, it seems that there are many newbies in the outfield, and some tasks are not in place, or the standard operating procedures are lacking. The staff encountered were very friendly and would greet the guests. It was obvious that the hotel's request was successful. Overall, the hotel has good qualities and is worth recommending.",positive
I liked everything very much. There was great room service. The maid Rukmsn did his job efficiently and responsibly and every day after cleaning he left a beautiful figure made of towels. I always made sure that there was water and a comfortable temperature in the room. Near the beach and ocean. I will definitely come to you again. Thank you very much.,positive
"Hello dear travelers! My husband and I rested at the Heritance Hotel (Heritance 5*) in the town of Ahungalla, from 6.11.23. Very cozy hotel, clean, cleaning every day. Amazing location on the ocean, we got great photos for a long memory. The food at the hotel is a little spicy for me, but there were always dishes that were not spicy. I especially want to mention a very responsive person whom we were lucky enough to meet. His name is Sampa. He can lead any excursion with great pleasure. Phone number +94 765402575. It so happened that on vacation my phone broke and I found myself without communication. Sampa helped me solve this problem. He took us in a comfortable car to the service center, helped with translation while the phone was being repaired, and gave us a short excursion along the coast, where we watched moray eels and sharks and fed turtles. We also visited the monument to those killed in the tsunami in 2004. Sampa is very sociable, speaks English very well, we understood him and were able to communicate. Always friendly and constantly interested in whether we were happy or not)). Thank him very much. Holidays in Sri Lanka were wonderful. We will definitely come here again!",positive
"We were greeted very friendly. We asked for a room with an ocean view and were told that it was possible, but almost all of the rooms have an ocean view, all are cozy and have a balcony. We asked to change to another one because there was a smell from the restaurant and they changed it for us, a chic room, you can see the ocean, a swimming pool, next to a tree where a family of monkeys once came and posed for a photo. The staff was polite, gave a bouquet of flowers, made figures out of towels on the bed, brought a coconut. The area was green, many trees, eucalyptus and palm trees with coconuts, we sunbathed in the shade of the trees, we liked it better than under umbrellas. Two swimming pools, one has more action, animation, water polo, volleyball in the pool and on the sand, etc., the other has relaxation, silence, jacuzzi, drinks are served upon request. We saw a monitor lizard, he passed by, posing peacefully, small chipmunks and birds on thin legs were running around. It rained almost every day from 16 to late evening. Sometimes only at night, which gave freshness and the opportunity not to burn and take a break from the sun. It was fun to swim in the pool when it was already dark, the pool was illuminated, very beautiful, tree branches above the water, warm rain falling, it was a thrill. There is a gym, we went once, everything you need is there, everything is in good condition. For entertainment, there is also billiards, snooker, a separate room on the second floor, friends whom we met enjoyed spending time there, table football, although the handles are no longer spinning well. I saw how they played ping pong tennis, the table is on the ground floor at the end of the hotel. Renovation work is underway on several rooms, it was far from us. We took breakfast and dinner. For lunch we ate fruit or went to a restaurant. The choice is large, there are seafood, shrimp and fish always, oysters on weekends. Fruits - papaya, pineapples, watermelon, carambola, passion fruit. I eat everything else at home, so the emphasis was on that. Wine and beer are available for an additional fee if you do not have an all-inclusive package. Live music in the restaurant on weekends, at the bar every evening. The ocean always had waves, which everyone liked and everyone swam and frolicked in the waves. The water is warm, the sand is pleasant. You can buy fruits nearby in a supermarket or you need to go to Bentota. You can also buy alcohol; we bought it from the Balapitya store. I recommend local calypse rum, you can buy it in the store, price 4700 rubles, course 1d = 325 rubles. We went by tuktuk, price 5d. We chose two excursions, the first is Elle, Edam Peak, bridge, train, plantations, everything is fine, but the road is long. The second is fishing, we had an economy tour for 150d for four, Summy water sport. the boat was normal, with a cabin and a roof, equipped, we caught about 20 Spanish mackerel and 5 sea bream by trolling. We didn’t catch any baracuda or tuna, but we saw the locals catch a large baracuda. Then the organizers prepared fish for us, everyone liked it. The restaurants we visited were Amal and Beach club. it is near the beach on the ocean. We went to Bentota for souvenirs. Everywhere they like to bargain, the prices are inflated, so feel free to cut the price in half, and you can, oddly enough, compare the price with WB. To summarize, I would go back there again.",positive
"When we bought a tour to this hotel, we didn’t know that it was undergoing a complete restoration, so we arrived and ended up just at a construction site, all sorts of work is being done everywhere, sanding the walls, you breathe dust, or painting some kind of stinking paint, the rooms are shaky, it’s extremely uncomfortable, I’ll attach photos to you now If you want to go on vacation at a construction site, I ask you to go to this hotel. Now I am in hotel number 262. The next day after my arrival, having met our respected guide in quotes from Anex, I asked to move us to another hotel, no action was taken on the part of Anex, after 4 days of correspondence, hotel representatives tried to move us to other rooms exactly like this stinky. Informative for those who want to spoil their holiday, the end of the hotel renovation is scheduled for spring!",negative
"Great stay at the hotel! Liked everything ! Very attentive staff! All requests were fulfilled instantly! The food is delicious, varied, the desserts are absolutely mind blowing! The ocean is very close. In the evening there is live music. There was a magic show for the children! There was a master class on making fish curry! I definitely recommend the hotel!

"The worst hotel I've ever seen. Traveled a lot. I don’t know where the positive reviews came from here, but it’s terrible. Dirty, the hotel is under construction (dirty construction workers eat with you at the next table, the dishes are dirty, the service is disgusting. During your vacation you listen not to the ocean, but to the sound of a jackhammer. The all-inclusive system is zero, you won’t wait for your cocktail (small choice). Bar from in the seventies. We got poisoned there (in response to our complaint, they said it was an allergy to curry), then other guys in this hotel got poisoned. The food was not tasty, the choice was small. After what I saw on the 4th day of our stay, I already had a showdown with the agent. , who sent us there with a tour operator and reached Colombo and Moscow, we were moved to another hotel in Rio (located nearby, the Heaven and Earth hotel is barely worthy of 2-3 stars, no more, very old with lazy staff,). the general lack of modern life, animation, etc. There are not enough sun loungers for everyone, there are 4 sun umbrellas for the entire hotel.",negative
"An absolutely deserted beach, a very calm and quiet place, but shops, entertainment and restaurants are also quite far away. The area is beautiful: monkeys, chipmunks, monitor lizards, a lot of greenery. We only took breakfast - there were seafood, meat, and fruits. The staff is helpful and polite, speaks English, Rukmal cleaned our room - always clean, fresh towels and water.",positive
"Once at Heritance, always again! From the very first moment you feel looked after. This applies to everyone from the general manager to the gardener, who surprises you with fresh flowers. The location right on the beautiful sandy beach is great. You can take wonderful walks there. Be careful when swimming, the current is strong and should not be underestimated. The beach boys keep a watchful eye! The food is simply great, the entire restaurant staff deserves an A. I hope that, despite being 90 years old, I can still be looked after often at Heritance. THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING!",positive
"We just returned from this hotel and can confidently recommend it. Polite and attentive staff, good all-inclusive meals, cozy rooms. The only negative is probably the distance from the airport (2.5 hours from Matala airport). Regarding excursions, we can recommend a local Russian-speaking guide - Dzhanita. Phone +94 70 7219723, Instagram @sri_lanka_unawatuna_tours. You can choose any convenient program for a day, two or another period. In terms of organization, everything is very cool; unlike a tour operator, the excursion is individual in a personal car and you can stay anywhere as long as you want. A good mood and great photos will be guaranteed.",positive

There were lots of dogs around that followed you to your room - I am afraid of dogs so it made me very nervous when I was walking around on my own. They could have some simple gates at the entrance to the stairs and this would stop the dogs getting to corridors with rooms. Booking.com advertised a few restaurants but only one restaurant and one pool bar were available to us. All inclusive guests were invited to a second restaurant but we were not allowed.

"In terms of service, this is the worst experience we've had so far :D. I travelled through over 40 countries, and nowhere did I see the personnel so chilled - but not in a good way :) Restaurant & bar team easily forgets your order, and even when they don't, you can wait for a simple coffee in a bar with 2 tables occupied for over 0.5 hour. They graciously add someone else's drinks to your bill (8 glasses of wine instead of actual 2? easy!) Moreover, some of them literally beg for tips, and when you tip them, it doesn't mean the service becomes any better. I had a birthday on the first night of our stay, but the reception forgot to inform the restaurant, so we went to ask for a candle. On the same evening we asked for refill of water, coffee and tea in the room (we didn't get a refill on that day, so we called the reception to ask for it as they themselves advised us to do), but instead a boy came with a brewed coffee charged extra... The room keys didn't work on one day, so we had to go all the way back to the reception to then be escorted back to the room by the maintenance guy who spent quite some time fixing the issue. Oh, and as for maintenance, you simply can't be left in peace here - e.g., laundry man barbarically opens your door even with the DND sign on... Last but not least, on arrival, my bank card didn't work, while on the check-out it did. Quite strange. Luckily we had another card. Will I recommend this hotel? Not really. Maybe only for 1-night stay to enjoy the beauty of nature. But if you want nice service and a proper care you would expect for this price, avoid this place. :)",negative

Had to carry my own bags to the room. The front office manager was the worst employee I've ever dealt with and was extremely rude. Tried to over charge me for meals and came up with some nonsense explanation which has nothing to do with the guest blaiming the head office. when i made a noise regarding it so other guests could hear he asked me what i want just to shut me up.

"As mentioned above the hotels seems to have changed its profile. The first thing that meets you after the majestic entry, that took my breath away the first time I came, is a large Russian banner. The hotel seems to accommodate huge groups of tourists from this country and many of them behave badly, bringing glass bottles into the pool, (drinking a lot in general) ignoring the personnel, treating the personnel like lesser beings (we saw this several times) and not greeting, making eye contact, or even acknowledging fellow hotel guests. I can understand that the world situation makes this awkward for them, but if you choose to travel out, you should make the effort- not expect to take over a beautiful tropical destination and ignore and cancel all others just by outnumbering them. I will not return to Heritance Ahungalla (the Triton to me) until this has changed. It was very expensive too, which is such a shame when the experience is so negative. I can understand the need to make money, but ruining such a beautiful hotel and experience along the way can hardly be worth it in the long run .

"1. The hotel did not reply my inquiries I sent via booking.com. Unlike other hotels I booked via booking.com, they always replied within 24 hours. 2. In contrast, they charged the room fee one day before I arrived based on the credit card info left here. My experience is the credit card is used for guarantee while other (5 stars) hotels will check with me my payment preferences when I check in. They can charge me via credit card if I didn’t show up in the end. 3. I asked if I can have late check-out at 12:30 one night before checkout date. Hotel staff just told me she can’t confirm it right now and asked me to check again the next day morning. My feeling is they don’t care customer satisfaction but care more abt their occupancy rate as this is 5 star hotel, which they probably think they can always get sufficient tourists to stay. 4. Lastly, some staff i.e breakfast time is less patient.",negative

Десятки людей мельтешат туда - сюда, но толково помочь с конкретным вопросом они не могут. На ресепшне нас регистрировало 8 человек (!). Между ними был бардак и неразбериха. В итоге мы ждали 40 мин, чтобы отсунировали наши паспорта и дали оплатить комнаты. Нет оборудованной зоны на пляже. Отель стоит на первой линии и имеет прямой выход к океану, но территория для отдыха не оборудована. Нет лежаков, зонтиков, урн, охраны. Просто сеточный забор заканчивается и дальше иди себе сам на песок. Может кому-то такой дикий вариант и по душе, но я не смогла сидеть спокойно и читать на песке, потому что ко мне приставали все проходящие мимо мутные личности. Пяти минут не давали спокойно посидеть. Кто-то все время что-то продавал, предлагал, хотел поболтать и тд. Если бы отель огородил свою территорию, такого не было бы. Так что на дикий пляж по сути ходить не очень нужен комфортно. К тому же отель не чистит его. И песок завален пластиком и мусором, принесенным волнами.",negative

"Das Hotel ist schon sehr in die Jahre gekommen. Ich weiß nicht, warum das hier keiner bisher geschrieben hat. Die Fotos, die das Hotel eingestellt hat, geben nicht den Zustand des Hotels wieder, -->Hochglanzfotos. Ich hatte Wasserflecken an der Decke und auch sonst ist das Zimmer an der ein oder anderen Stelle nicht mehr ansehnlich gewesen. Es benötigt, meiner Ansicht nach, dringend einer Renovierung. Das Essensangebot bzw. die Auswahl, in Büfett-Form, schwankte sehr je nachdem wie voll das Hotel war. Das gilt auch für das Frühstück. Sprich, je weniger Gäste, desto weniger Angebot. Das ist eigentlich kein Problem, jedoch fand ich zum Teil die Auswahl wirklich sehr spärlich, vor allem da ich wusste, was an anderen Tagen angeboten wurde.",neutral

Pretul de 250 de dolari pe noapte este exagerat pentru o camera cu tavanul plin de mucegai. Mancarea nu este chiar buna. Peste pretul din meniu se va adauga: 10% servicii, 3% alte taxe si peste toate astea (pretul de baza + 10% + 3%) se adauga tva de 18% la toata suma. Hotelul este plin de rusi, ceea ce nu este placut pentru noi cei din lumea civilizata. Se trezesc de dimineata, isi pun prosoapele pe sezlong pentru a le rezerva si se duc inapoi la somn.

"Pointless in requesting any type of room beforehand. It didn&#39;t happen for us! As soon as we entered our room, there was a terrible smell of damp. On our balcony there was a white powder. I cleaned this up, and there it was again. It turned out they were decorating the room upstairs, and the &quot;powder&quot; was paint being rubbed down. You couldn&#39;t sit on the balcony without it getting on your clothes, and the stench in the room was really bad. In fairness, they said we could change room. I went to check and there was no smell or powder, and the room was prepared apart from bed and bathroom linen, but still they said it would not be ready for 24 hours. We then went for dinner around 9.00 pm. Unfortunately, the food had obviously been there since there since the start, and was either &quot;scrapings&quot; or what no one else wanted. Good nights sleep, then we both became I&#39;ll. I just had moderate sickness and diahorrea. My partner had diahorrea , but really, really bad vomiting. It lasted 15 hours, before he finally settled. Towards the end of this we were advised our new room was ready. I said how we sick we were. Probably, a language problem, but they offered us room service!!! The last thing we needed was food - we couldn&#39;t keep anything down. We couldn&#39;t move room - we were in bed, intermittently, using the bathroom.. By the following day, the powder has stopped appearing (later found out they had stopped rubbing down) and we kind of got used to the stench, and couldn&#39;t face packing up again and moving for 3 nights. _x000D_ The beach location is beautiful. The gardens are lovely. Our balcony view was lovely. _x000D_ The rooms are smelly and need updating(maybe why we got the powder). . I didn&#39;t enjoy the food, probably because we were ill, but it was varied, and maybe our sickness had nothing to do with it, who knows. But I would suggest you eat early, rather than later, when the food has been kept around for a couple of hours rather than replaced._x000D_ The food in the cafe is lovely, hot and freshly cooked. The staff are really good.",negative

"Taking an HSBC offer for lunch dinner and breakfast at a discounted price at Heritance Hotel, Ahungalla our visit to this hotel last weekend was to serve a purpose. We were looking for good hotel for my son, his wife and the two kids (my grand children) coming to Sri Lanka end of July this year for a week’s holiday from Germany._x000D_ _x000D_ For my daughter in law and my grand children it would be their first visit to this Island. So it was very natural we wanted the best available resorts in Sri Lanka. Having seen and been in many hotels around the island, Heritance Ahungalla vast space, a centrally located large pool, and the entire complex so close to the sea left us little to desire._x000D_ _x000D_ Being very health conscious I found the salad bar was more than average to keep my hunger at bay. There was a variety of hot and cold food to choose from and the restaurant staffs were very friendly serving with smiles too._x000D_ _x000D_ I would not exaggerate a rare feature absent at most tourist hotels: Meeting helpful personnel. However, a pleasant young lady- Vishmie de Silva- made it her second nature to disprove this common notion, by answering all our questions patiently. _x000D_ She took time to show the different kinds of rooms and all other the facilities available at this complex untiringly with a smiling face. She promoted and convinced us this hotel is exactly what we are looking for single handedly._x000D_ _x000D_ When she finally leaves this hotel to migrate to different country end of Feb 2013 this hotel loses a valuable asset. I also know that no one is indispensable but there are special people who leave lasting impressions on the sands of time and Vishmie does exactly this._x000D_ _x000D_ I am certain my grand children and daughter in law would not be disappointed with their stay here at Heritance Ahungalla shortly.",positive
