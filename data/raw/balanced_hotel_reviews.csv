In my view this is the equivalent of a 3 star hotel in the UK (not 5 star) as positioned. Having waited over 2 hours to be shown to our rooms we opted not to stay. 1. Old food was left outside rooms. 2. the main pool in all the photos is public ( paying a lot of money for this) 3. it would appear that an entire wing of the hotel is being held up by scaffolding 4. our rooms smelt of drains. 5. they got the lunch order wrong!,neutral
"After a week of touring around Sri Lanka for the first part of our honeymoon we were looking forward to spending a week by the sea in a 5 star resort. Unfotunately we were very disappointed with this hotel. The good points about the hotel are the large swimming pools and the view of the sea from most parts of the hotel. The bad points are numerous: -During our stay the weather was very windy and it rained heavily. The hotel is not designed to cope heavy rainfall as it is designed in a very modern, open minimalist way. All the corridors, a bar and the cafe are completely open to the elements. This meant that rain was constantly pouring in and the floors were several centimetres deep in some places. This made the floors very slippy and we found we were unable to get around the hotel much and it made sitting in the front bar and cafe impossible as the bar does not have any front covers to keep the rain out. The staff are constantly sweeping the water away and moving furniture around out of the rain which was very irritating. The overall cleanliness of the hotel is not that great either and the hotel is starting to look rundown. The bathroom in our room had lots of mould in the shower(picture attached), and there was no bath option, you have to pay for a premium top floor room to get a bath! Having stayed in many 5 star and 4 star hotels all over Europe and Asia, I would say this is a 3 star at best, the other 3 star hotels we stayed in during our holiday were in fact much better. -The food is boring and pricey by Sri Lankan standards although you would expect that in a 5 star hotel. We went to the fine dining restaurant one night which was pretty good, although very run-of-the-mill options such as steak and mash. The desserts were interesting but after waiting over half an hour, when they arrived they were poorly executed and my dessert was not even what I ordered. Being the only other couple in the restaurant this was certainly not what we expected. The breakfast is also disappointing, the only positive being the traditional Sri Lankan curries offered. The omelette queue was impressive every morning and that only left under-cooked waffles, anaemic chicken sausages and fatty bacon cooked to order. The rest of the buffet was luke-warm at best. The fresh fruit offered however was fesh and ripe and there was lots of choice. -The beach is not for swimming or being on for any length of time. There are local people constantly waiting on the edge of the hotel and the beach trying to sell you things aggressively and stray dogs wandering about do not make you feel safe. The security guards do nothing about the sellers and leave them to shout at you whilst you are lying on sunbeds within the hotel grounds. -Another point to make is that there is nothing to do in the local area- we went to the 'turtle hatchery' before going to the hotel and it took us 10min to look at the 2 ponds in which 2 poor adult turtles are kept, and a small area of sand where the eggs are buried before they hatch. We ended up leaving early as we were fed up with the food, not being able to go on to the beach and the inefficient staff. Wish we had gone to the Maldives!",negative
"The location is good right on the beach but that's about it. The sprawling property has no charm, no grace, it's actually disgraceful. The service is pathetic. There is only one elevator servicing each wing and reaching your room is nothing short of a long uninteresting walk. The lobby lights are off at night and we literally had to walk in the torch light of the mobile phone when we had to leave at dawn for the whale watching tour. The spa treatments are an eye wash. The food is so lousy there is no sense of any combinations also the main course is served in a bright white light area if chef fin dishes that are broken and it feels like eating at a very low budget wedding or a college canteen. The last night was my husband's birthday and I had even offered to pay for a good cake, but my agent assured that it had been arranged free. It was one of the worst cakes that looked like it had been bought from the cheapest bakery in town. The common area toilets were so filthy I dreaded going there more than once. The key card that was issued to me was in someone else's name. Just about everything was bad about this property. I wonder how they have procured a licence to operate as a 5 Star. I do not recommend it to anybody at all! When the staff came to know that we were upset, they wouldn't leave us alone at breakfast and created an unnatural fuss. I found that extremely unprofessional. One of the staff members asked me what the problem was and after I shared all the grievances with her at the end of the conversation she actually said ""wish you a good stay Ms. Natu "" what should I call that? Deliberate or really dumb? If they don't get their act together soon, I guarantee that they will have to close down in the next couple of years!",negative
"Pros- Relaxed beach location with spacious rooms. Good choice of bars and restaurants. Excellent breakfast buffet. Friendly staff, especially in the restaurants and around the pool. Very nice, big pools. Lots of interesting wildlife. Laundry service was excellent and good value. Cons- There were some hawkers on the property around the pool area selling sarongs and tours. An annoyance when trying to relax. The air con in our room was not very effective. By contrast it was excellent in our kids room. There was black mold in the shower. When it rains, the communal corridors are prone to flooding. The room attendants are very pushy about tips. Our attendant Ranil visited our room a day before we left to tell us he wouldn’t be there the following day. We tipped him well, but the next day, the day of our checkout, a new room attendant who we didn’t know came into the room twice on the pretext of checking the minibar and hung around clearly also expecting to be tipped. We are always happy to tip for service, but this pushy experience made us quite uncomfortable and left a bad final impression of our stay. The day before leaving we asked for a late checkout on one of our two rooms and were told that would be possible for an extra $50 US. We happily agreed to this, but the following morning we were told neither room was available. This seems unlikely as the hotel was not at all busy (it was five days after the terrorist attacks). So we had a few hours hanging around the hot hotel common areas before our airport pickup. Not the best way to end what was otherwise a very enjoyable and relaxed stay.",neutral

"We were a family of ten having booked five rooms in Heritance Ahungalla and were really looking forward to our stay after a long drive of Six hours from Nuwara Eliya. But right from check in it was a big disappointment, as check in itself took more than one hour. The rooms were not as expected of this property, the key didn’t work for one room, lights didn’t work in another room, the wash rooms were ancient looking with flush making scary sound in another room. The pass word for wife was outdated and had to be changed. The duty manager was not apologetic but showing his helplessness , arrogant and argumentative.The rooms were of different sizes and badly done up, never expected from Heritage Ahungalla.Instead of king size beds we were given single beds joined . It was a terrible experience stay and the worst of our trip of seven days in Sri Lanka. We will never recommend this hotel to any one. J P Alex and family.",negative
"The hospitality starts from the 1st step into the hotel; warm welcome with traditional variety of fresh juices. Front desk was very helpful and friendly. Once they saw the kids, they were informing the parents about the events organized for the kids on that day. They had magic show and chef programs for kids during our stay. The room was clean. Food was amazing at the restaurant and all staff were very helpful. In the night, they had local live music. This hotel has 2 pools; The green pool with Jacuzzi and trees around is my choice and it is the best. They also have plenty of indoor and outdoor sports.",positive
"We stayed one night in February 2022 at Heritance Ahungalla. The room was very spacious and clean. We requested a quiet room and the hotel gave us a room which is far from the central pool area, facing the second pool. It was indeed very quiet. The welcome fruit was nice touch. The staff there are very nice and you can ask all kinds of questions. Buffet for dinner and breakfast had both good selection. You can taste authentic Sri Lankan food there although there are many western dishes. We sat in the garden at the dinner as it was quieter. The beach is wonderful and great place to watch sunset. The pool in the center was bit clouded but the second pool was not soo bad. If you want to experience Bawa hotel, this is another wonderful resort.",positive

"We hosted an International Conference on Assisted Reproductive Technologies for a group of 90 doctors from around the world. We have been hosting such meetings annually in destinations like Nepal, Goa, Khajuraho, Seychelles, Singapore & more. This was one of our best experiences with a Hotel that taught us what Sri Lankan hospitality is all about. The front office staff, the back-end staff, the F & B staff and the event management team were all excellent and helpful and set new bench-marks fro us for future meetings. The property is visually stunning and the open lobby takes your breath away with the majestic ocean view on entering the Hotel. Attention to small details like the design of the trolley that brings welcome drinks to a guest checking in and the smiling faces of the front desk staff go a long way in first impressions. Although the property is 35 years old, it is very well maintained with huge trees planted in the stair-wells. The architecture and design and the room interiors all blend for an exotic asian experience. The meals are wonderful, the four bars in the hotel are superlative and the three swimming pools take your breath away. The conference was running two halls simultaneously and the meeting went off without a glitch. Three nights we had music concerts in the main hall and cocktails being served. This was a global gathering and the unanimous opinion was ""this was one of the best experiences we have had!"" Since I was the President of the meeting, I did not have time to relax and want to go back for a short break only to take in the same sights and smells again. This was like Heaven.",positive

"this is the 3rd time I have been to Ahungalla, sorry to say I found it pretty ordinary, definitely not 5-star anymore. Good: Friendly staff. Bad: Terrible buffet and food offering, pretty ordinary food repeated again and again. Not worth it. Though it is costly, hard even to believe aitkense runs this place. Cleanliness in toilets and bathrooms is not up to the standard. Pretty an ordinary set-up, not the hotel it used to be.",negative

"Came here for a couple of nights on our family trip to Sri Lanka. Rooms were clean and comfortable and service was overall very good. The main breakfast / dinner restaurant was always smoky (from preparing food) and it seemed there was no air con or exhaust fan to remove the smoke. Selection of food at the buffet was good. Cocktails were poorly made and extremely strong! Pool was not as clean as expected and it didn't seem that it was cleaned everyday. Jacuzzi was full of sand. The shower glass in our bathroom had soap scum which looked like it hadn't been cleaned for a month. Security around the perimeter of the hotel especially on the beach side needs to be beefed up. There were a few people around the beach who were hassling the patrons. The positives were that there was a live band at the bar every night and amazing views of the beach from the rooms. Overall, average especially for a resort that is meant to be 5 star.",neutral

"I planned a day out two weeks ago and requested details from the Hotel. I got the confirmation on 10 Feb with the reservation number. Representative from the hotel called me and confirmed my booking also. When We went to the hotel, the front office said they could not give us a room since hotel is fully occupied and they give the rooms for the day use on availability basis(not informed at the time of booking). However, they agreed to give us a changing room (B Grade room as per the front office) on FOC basis and we said ok since we traveled 2 hours from Colombo to Ahungalla. However, we didn't get the changing room also which was agreed to give within 10 minutes. We were there for about 1 hour and we cancelled our day out and came back to Colombo. At that time the front office staff asked the confirmation number and he said the booking was in the system. :( I don't about the process of Heritance Ahungalla, but this was my experience with this Hotel.",negative
"It's not like it used to be when they used to call it Triton, The staff at some points are friendly, the food was not up to standard compared to what we use to have, you could have counted the number of dishes on the buffet and it was 70% Sri Lankan, we requested for a set of pillows at around 10.30 p.m which we did not receive when we called the phone was diverted to someone who abruptly told us that the hotel is closed after 10.30 so the housekeeping is not available and therefore they cannot do anything, once asked who is speaking did he say he is the security, and hung up abruptly, we called again and then the reception adhered to our request.",negative

"I had read so many great reviews about this hotel and was really looking forward to staying here, and I somehow feel like I have stayed on another planet compared to the other people who reviewed here. I will comment that the Chef Sarun was fantastic and made the best meal we had in Sri Lanka, the gentleman who was serving us was very good. Now, the hotel is getting very tired and could use a renovation, I was first taken to a room with 2 single beds, being a couple this wasn't good enough, but also laying on the bed it was comfy, the second room had a double bed but was uncomfortable, so we left it to the young man who took us to the room to try and sort out something else - either putting blankets under or a pillow top, anything, we gave them 2hrs and nothing happened. I went to reception, spoke with the executive gentleman, who apologized and said we could look at other rooms, apparently they only have 1 type of mattress which I don't believe. In the meantime I had ordered food from the restaurant and was told it would still be another 15mins away, we proceeded to the next room, same, next room same, so I said I would settle just for the twin singles as we were only staying one night. He then said he would get a new room sorted out and have our luggage moved. When I got back, my food was waiting and it was cold, less than 15mins. I advised the waiter and he said thanks- what for ????? We waited 1hr for no key, went to reception and collected our new room key. Went to the room, located at the end of the hotel, and our luggage was not there yet. Next thing I'm looking at the table and there is ANTS EVERYWHERE, now I'm talking about 1000+ all having a little party on the ground and under the table, walking down the walls etc. I have plenty of photos which I will put up when I have better Internet at home. I rang front desk and we got moved again 2 doors down, we went for a swim for 1hr again, come back and there was more ANTS in the room. We didn't get offered another room, but got dinner which is the only reason this gets a 2 star and not 1. We didn't sleep very well and the band / music was playing very loud well into the night. We had to check out at 7am, I had ordered a breakfast, but when I went to check out, I was hauled to the cashier office, and they kept me there for 10mins arguing about the meal from the afternoon which was cold and I was told would be taken off the room, and, they also tried to charge me for a phone call from my room, which was the executive ringing the manager about the ANTS. The lady who apparently was guest relations needs to be sacked, the cashier needs to be sacked for trying to rip me off. This left the worst taste in my opinion of Sri Lanka and I cannot believe this hotels staff would act like this to customers. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone, hopefully management looks at this and takes action.",negative
"We booked our holiday in aid of 2 special events, our wedding anniversary and our friends wanted to renew their vows celebrating 25 years of marriage. In the run up to the holiday we contacted their Guest Relations Executive a Shanika Jayasekara who really was fantastic. Shanika went above and beyond to make sure both events were very special, we had room upgrades and these were right by the green pool which was our preferred room location, our rooms were made available for an early check in and this was quick and hassle free with a welcoming drink and cold face towels. On the day of our anniversary we were made to feel very special and given a cake in the evening and our table was decorated beautifully with flowers. As a surprise for our friends renewing their vows we had arranged for their grown up children to fly out for the ceremony and to join us for the rest of the holiday, Shanika was able to allocate them a room next to ours and help hide them until the ceremony. The vow renewal was a very special event indeed with drummers, dancers and an elephant, the way the hotel and especially Shanika organise these events is perfect, they really do think of everything which means we were able to just sit back and enjoy every minute of their special day. The package price was very reasonable and included a 5 course meal on the beach in the evening, with a cake. The hotel itself has the friendliest staff who really want to ensure you have a fantastic time, we are still here at the moment but felt we had to write a review sooner rather than later to let everyone know what a fantastic hotel this is. The food is very good and always something to choose to meet our tastes and if not the chef will happily cook something especially for you, we chose to eat outside in the garden area which was quieter than the main restaurant and lit beautifully with lanterns. The pool attendants made sure we had 7 sunbeds in the gardens right between our rooms and the green pool which was beautifully quiet with rarely more than 5 people in it at any one time. The beach sellers are not pushy if you are firm with them, we were able to relax on the beach without much disturbance. There are other members of staff who deserve mentioning but unfortunately while writing this I do not have their names at hand, however I will endeavour to write an addition review to this at the end of the holiday when I have their names and can give a final update.",positive

"Unless your dream holiday is to sit by a pool all day with staff continually at beck and call this isn't for you. There is very little to do around the hotel unless you have a car or a driver. we found ourselves getting rather bored of it, quite quickly. The hotel is on a stunning sandy beach but you cannot swim in the sea, and the areas round the two pools are full of Russians with money to burn. I don't like customers being rude to staff but saw plenty of this. However staff accepted it due to massive tips and pretty much ignored everyone else. Food in the hotel was good and rooms were clean but wouldn't go back. The whole hotel was pretty impersonal with massive long white corridors which reminded me of Victorian hospitals. This hotel was the final one on our trip so we only stayed two nights, which for us was one night too many. As I said in my intro the hotel was perfect if you want to spend all day on a sun lounger but it didn't suit us.",negative

Arrived at the Heritance Ahungalla at 2.00am in the morning after a 10.5 hour flight from Gatwick and a 2 hour coach transfer from airport. Absolutely tired out. We had booked 2 double rooms and 2 single rooms through Thomson's I had had problems regarding the wrong names in the wrong rooms and couldn't get it sorted through their call centre. When we went to check in they had only three rooms with a little bit of stern talk they sorted it. I believe the problem lies with Thomson's Their airport Rep was with us but did absolutely nothing to help. After that the Holiday was superb. The Hotel has the most friendly of staff Especially Himasha. The Buffet food is excellent with a vast variety of cuisines from English through Italian to Chinese and Asian. One tip! every one advises not to swim in the sea. as there are strong under currents safe enough to paddle but even then you can feel the under current drawing you out. However the 2 Hotel pools are beautiful and so swimming is no problem. I should give this hotel a rating of 5 but the problem at check in forces me to drop a star sorry.,negative

"Okay it's one of the best hotel is Sri Lanka, it has won the award of best leisure hotel by the minister of tourism. Sure, the two pools are outstanding, the rooms are nice, the area is quiet and the beach is nice but... staying there we kept asking ourselves: is it how one should experience Sri Lanka beaches? Just before we stayed at Mirissa, a lovely beach with a lot of atmosphere, a couple small hotels and guest houses, a few waterfront bars and a great laid back atmosphere. The Heritance is the opposite. Big resort where you pay over-priced drink and food served by stylish staff. The hotel probably owns the beach, because there is nothing else around. Would advice to go there if you don't mind missing the charm of more ""informal places"". Compare to other places, we found the contact with the locals to be biased. It's either hotel staff or very insisting beach sellers. The later can be quite annoying especially when the seat in group of 8-10 just in front of your chair and stay all day long. The food was not exceptional, certainly not in line with the price they ask for it (in Sri Lankan terms of course!).",neutral
"My friend and I stayed at this hotel for the last 4 days of our sri lankan tour. We stopped off at the turtle sanctuary beforehand which was very cute (15 mins ish from hotel) we had a lovely greeting at the hotel- staff very pleasant. Our room was sweet, we got a complimentary upgrade. Spacious room, lovely sea view. Room a little old, could do with a bit of a spruce up. Poolside and beach were very quiet, got a sun bed every day. The ""beach boys"" were quite annoying and pushy but on the last day we bought something from the ladies and gave them some of our stuff, they are poor so appreciated it. Weather in late April Was ok, very very very hot, slightly cloudy, a little rain. Beach was beautiful but didn't venture into the rough sea. Stayed on the hotel complex as it's a little out. Food was ok, nothing special but staff really helpful. 4 days was perfect wouldn't do anymore. All in all a lovely stay just could do with an update.",neutral
"Approach to hotel uninviting, but then through the gates a lovely setting and warm welcome, but irritation factor from incessant beach vendors and loud guests and even the street dogs make it into the hotel too because of its open design. Felt sorry for the staff dealing with inconsiderate drunks day and night. The service was hit and miss, food varied and well presented, but not the best I had in Sri Lanka, though signature spiced ice cream was wonderful. Some very nice staff, but suspect some unsavoury ones in league with beach vendors and tuk tuk drivers. Beach immediately in front of hotel fine, but elsewhere litter and no peace if walking cos of beach boys. Found lack of chains and double locks on room doors unnerving. Pillows gave best night's sleep in SL. Spa has a great range of treatments and lovely staff and one of the nicest I have ever been to and worth every penny. Would not choose to return here unfortunately. Prefer Heritance Kandalama.",neutral
"Overall we were disappointed with this hotel compared to others we stayed in during our trip to Sri Lanka. The room was tired and badly needing updated, things like seeing the same room service plates still outside the same room door hours later was unhygienic and attracted bugs. The food, we were half board so ate at the buffet breakfast and dinner. I really struggled as at dinner there was only a variety of curries available and being pregnant and adverse to certain smells I couldn’t even go up to see what was available. However the staff were fantastic at dealing with this for me and I honestly couldn’t have been in better hands. I really did appreciate their efforts in ensuring I ate a proper meal once they realised I was struggling. The pools were easily the best pools we had access to during our trip, we spent a lot more time using these facilities than we did anywhere else. One of the things I disliked was being shouted at from behind the chain link fence to come and see what the locals were selling but they’re not on hotel property so I understand there isn’t anything staff can do about them. We were on our honeymoon and our tour operator had told us in our itinerary to bring our marriage certificate in order to receive honeymoon benefits. However when we checked in staff said it wasn’t needed and didn’t acknowledge it was our honeymoon at all.",neutral
We just stayed one day full board basis and it was really worth the drive and the money we spent. Booked the hotel with an offer but the comforts and facilities were just the same like before. Staff was extra ordinary going out of the way to help us. Really enjoyed. Food was delicious.,positive
"Having stayed at this hotel around 8 or 9 times over the last 20 years, we returned with high expectations. I am pleased to be able to say that the actual experience exceeded our expectations. We were given a large room on the top floor, well away from the restaurants and other potential sources of noise. The room was furnished beautifully and the bed was very comfortable. Everything was squeaky-clean and kept that way by our room boy, who also replenished our fruit bowl regularly. The hotel has a superb location at the end of a long beach and we were pleased to find that you can still stroll along its full extent without meeting more than a handful of people. There are two pools and plenty of sunbeds in the extensive garden area, where you can watch the many birds and chipmunks as well as the occasional monitor lizard passing through. We enjoyed the food, particularly the excellent dinner arranged for us by the head chef. The weather during our stay was pretty mixed, but we managed a few dinners at the seafood station by the side of the pool. I would recommend both the food and the relaxed atmosphere there.There is also a small covered 'open-air' restaurant area, where we had some good curries. Breakfast is a sumptuous affair with a wide range of choices, including hoppers and curries as well as the more traditional European-style offerings. There is also a splendid selection of fruit and juices. Whilst the hotel and its facilities are very good indeed, it was the friendliness and efficiency of the staff which really made our stay memorable. We were constantly surprised by the way in which people anticipated our wishes/preferences and provided what we were looking for - and much more - without ever having to ask for it. Truly exceptional service and hospitality! There were many familiar faces amongst the staff and we were also pleased to find that Eranda, our favourite tuk-tuk driver, was still offering his services by the gate. We have used him on many occasions and have found him very accommodating and utterly reliable. Resort areas such as Bentota and Hikkaduwa are within easy reach by tuk-tuk. We even went as far as Unawatuna this time - and enjoyed a 'roti lunch' with Eranda in Galle on the way. (Without him we would have struggled to order anything.) As the title above suggests, we have no complaints whatsoever. We only regretted not being able to stay longer. However, we will certainly try to come back.",positive

"Property: Whole Hotel is situated in a calm and quiet property... Though secluded from the city of colombo... you can manage to get all necessities if you travel in very short distance... Service: Service within hotel is not good... They need to stick to basics... * There was lint on the bed sheets from the cushions and the comforter... * There was no shampoo in the bath, on asking i was informed shampoo and bath gel is one and the same... When asked whether the person claiming so was sure about it... he returned with shampoo... * You are given seat in restaurant however you are not served water until you ask for it... You have to remind the attendants to refill water more than once... * Language is a problem, however all the people try their best to communicate... Thumbs Up: GEMS and Jewel Shop is pretty good...",neutral
"Plus: Rooms: nicely maintained, well serviced. Animation team: friendly and engaging Restaurant: staff are friendly and food is good and varied Beach and swing pool: attractive, but also some minuses. Minus: Price of drinks (e.g. wine, cappuccino, cocktails) too expensive compared with similar category hotels in Sri Lanka Cleanliness of premises: with a little more effort would this place be cleaner and thus more attractive. Windy weather conditions are not an excuse to leave things on the ground. Hotels in Sri Lanka clearly do an effort to group Chinese visitors together in the restaurant. This is not just a detail as the habits of these people was often experienced as plain impolite: noisy, jumping to front of queue ....",neutral

"We stayed at this hotel for a week at the end of a touring holiday in Sri Lanka. It is claimed to be the only five-star hotel on this coast, which is not entirely accurate. In some aspects the hotel is very good - the two huge swimming pools, large public areas, well spread-out accommodation & nicely-appointed rooms - and deserves its five stars. However, there are some aspects which are not five-star and were a source of irritation during our stay. For example, on the whole, the food was very good but tended to be served not very hot, and is rather expensive for what it is. We tried the buffet, which is OK, but very expensive. We had several meals in the Coffee Shop, which is more reasonable in price but, despite being a la carte, we twice had to send food back because it was virtually cold. Getting things like that fixed, which would happen promptly in a real 5-star hotel, seemed to take an age. Service is helpful & charming, but inept and inefficient at times. There often seems to be no-one on duty with sufficient authority to make a decision about things. Complaints are handled by constantly referring them to some-one else, who often is not in a position to actually do anything, other than telling someone else. The staff are not very quick to clear up after the rain sweeps into the public areas (which are tiled) leaving very slippery surfaces around for too long. Overall we enjoyed our stay at the hotel, but I think they could try harder to merit their 5-star tag.",neutral

"I booked three rooms at half-board and came with my wife, 20 month old daughter and wife's relatives for two nights in September 2013. I was keen to experience a Geoffrey Bawa architected hotel and was impressed by the thoughtfulness of his design. The hotel aims to merge with nature, and allow for breezes to flow throughout the compound, providing a natural cooling. There were two pools, which we well maintained and a great place to lounge through during the day. I was very keen to experience the food at the hotel - as I had heard that it was rated as one of the best dining resorts in Sri Lanka and I was not disappointed. I was struck by the thoughtfulness of the dishes in the Jute restaurant - and also couldn't recall any dish tasting bad. All the food was balanced and tasty. Even the Sri Lankan food was unbelievably good. The staff were helpful and always with a smile. Also enjoyed the gym, badmington court and table tennis facility in the venue. The only negative for me was the reasonable isolation of the resort. As I tend to always like to explore the surroundings, I was a bit disappointed when leaving the resort by the lack of facilities around walking distance of the hotel. Again that was my preference, but if you wish to travel and only stay in a resort to rest and relax it is a great place.",positive

"Having spent many holidays along the beautiful west coast of Sri Lanka, trying out the various hotels over the years, I can honestly say that Heritance Ahungalla is my favourite. Convenient to get to from Colombo on the new Expressway, it is situated about 90 kilometers from Colombo. From the moment I drive up to the entrance with the fantastic view right up to the sea, I feel at home. There is such a feeling of peace and serenity with the warm yet gentle welcome from the staff. I have requested sea view rooms and have never been disappointed. Room 305 is my favourite. If you like tasty food and lots of it, Heritance Ahungalla is the place to be. I think their chefs are about the best in Sri Lanka. The buffet has a huge selection of dishes to please the western and local palate. The salads varied and desserts yummy. Heritance has two attractive large swimming pools, and also a very attractive beach. The seas around Sri Lanka can be dangerous around monsoon time, but if you love messing around in the shallow water, going for long walks or just sun bathing it is wonderful. I strongly recommend Heritance Ahungalla, if you want a relaxing holiday. I always come away feeling rested and energized wishing I could stay longer! Elizabeth Gunewardene",positive
"Comparing this hotel to other Heritance properties it falls well below. The facilities are good and the hotel is ok. In every area of the hotel, staff seemed a little directionless. When we arrived the checkin process was disorganised. Everyone was quite pleasant but just not efficient. At the pool bar we had 3 waiters just walk straight past us. The person who seemed to be the head waiter was standing there checking his mobile phone. Eventually we had to ask to be served. On the pool deck no one was offering service. We had to go hunt it down. Some people were staying here on an ""all inclusive"" package which may explain the poor service. The buffet was ""unloved"". I'd often open a closh to find it empty underneath - eg no sausages or bacon at 8.30am during breakfast. The staff at this hotel had poor English skills and it was often difficult to be understood. I appreciate that English is a second language but it's essential in a five star hotel. This hotel needs a sharp eyed management team to set high standards and coach staff effectively. On a positive note - Heritance Hotels have the best toilet paper of any hotel group in the world!!",neutral

"The rooms were very clean. The pool of the hotel was huge and was maintained very well. However, when we checked in, the staff took ages to give us a room because it was not ready at that time. Even they took another half hour to bring out luggage into the room. We came to the hotel at about 7pm, and their normal check in time is 2pm, so they had ample time to prepare the room for us. We wanted an extra bed and so told the reception at the time of check in, but they brought the extra bed at around 10 in the night. At lunch on the second day, their was a live insect in the passion fruit dessert and when we told the staff they just took it away and didn't bother to apologize. Then at check out, they manipulated us to give 5 stars and write a good review on trip advisor. No wonder it has a rating of 4.5 on trip advisor. Overall the service was poor and not to our satisfaction.",negative

"We have just returned from a most wonderful stay at this hotel, and can recommend it in every way. The situation, right on a beautiful beach, and the architecture blends perfectly in to the environment and makes the most of the cooling breezes. It is conveniently placed for visits to near by Galle, and we especially enjoyed cycling through the lanes of local villages. What makes this hotel stand out, though , is the staff. Although we only stayed for a week, they made us feel like members of the family, and we were totally at home there. Every member of staff went out of their way to anticipate and meet our needs, and it is almost impossible to single out particular individuals who made our stay so special. KK, the restaurant manager and his assistant Anushka, ensured we had all we needed for every meal, and even arranged a delicious picnic for us to enjoy on our trip home. The food was absolutely delicious, catering for every taste, and Praveen Fernando found us a shady table outside for breakfast every morning. Mr de Silva, the general manager, was always on hand, and we felt cosseted and cherished throughout our stay. The swimming pools are amazing, and the shady garden a delight to relax in. The rooms are comfortable and spotless , again, with wonderful service. The local people of Sri Lanka , offering such warm and genuine a hospitality, are what makes a visit to this country so very special, this can be experienced in full at the Heritance Hotel. We had the most wonderful holiday , and will be recommending it to family and friends. We can't wait to return. Many thanks to all the members of staff who contributed to our delightful stay.",positive

"We stayed 5 nights as an add-on to our two week island tour when the hotel was busy mainly with German, Russian and Ukrainian guests many of who were in large groups and are on all inclusive packages. Its is a quiet location on a beautiful beach with no other hotels nearby. Whilst we were there the sea was quite rough with a strong undercurrent. There is a well designed and maintained infinity pool, just off the lobby, that blends in with the sea giving the impression that you are actually in the sea. There is also another large pool elsewhere in the grounds. We were disappointed with the deluxe room that we were offered and so paid considerably more (although discounted) for a luxury suite upgrade which was very nice though was somewhat more than we needed though nothing else appeared to be available. The main restaurant (Jute) serves an excellent buffet as it offers a large choice of good quality international food though with probably less Asian dishes than we had at other hotels elsewhere. The groups sit at large tables in middle of this restaurant and can be quite noisy at dinner times. Our room hotel guide stated that attire for dinner was ‘smart casual’ though this was largely ignored by many guests and especially by some men who wore jeans, shorts, T shirts and football shirts. Beach fine dining was excellent with a good choice of dishes from an a la carte menu including some wonderful seafood. Attentive and friendly service made this a truly memorable occasion. There was a lack of sun beds and umbrellas around the pools and grounds. Also, the sun beds and towels were old and many of the beds were broken or had wheels missing so there was the daily early morning rush to get towels on good beds with umbrellas. The hotel needs to invest money in buying new furniture and towels to ensure there are enough for all guests. Lunchtime food at the pool bar was limited to burgers, sandwiches and half a dozen other snacks which really should be supplemented by some salads and some more Asian snacks. Service in the grounds Service away from the two pools was infrequent and we usually had to walk to the bar to buy drinks. We have discussed our views with a representative of the hotels management (Dinusha Kularatne) who says he will be writing a report detailing our comments. It's a good hotel but it didn't live up to our expectations of the luxury hotel we wanted at the end of our holiday.",neutral
"We went here purely for relaxation The hotel is a dream, the staff is friendly and the food was fantastic. Plenty of live food counters in the buffet they were entertained our special request on food . We were able to see the kitchen & we had nice cooking class with chefs. Rooms were good and has a great antique out fit. Two pools were great option for us. We loved the place and we had a great experience for the spent and waiting to go back to the heritance ahungalla soon.",positive
"Stayed for 9 nights in January (wish it had been more). This is not a Caribbean 5* resort so don't compare as such. It is half the price and in a way better, in that it has a rustic charm and a really chilled out atmosphere. It is more than ok and we thought the food, location and the people were brilliant. The two pools are lovely the beach beautiful and the Spa excellent. Yes some of the complex could do with an upgrade but that is just being picky. Thank you to all who made our holiday special we would have no second thoughts about returning. A special mention to the chefs who gave us a tour of the kitchen and offered to cook me (as part of my all inclusive) a special dish and cooked me the best curry I have ever eaten in my life. That's how personal this place is.",neutral

"This hotel was the first destination of our honeymoon. The cool and calm environment that one encounters as you drive through the gates up to the reception is certainly inviting and to say that reflects the hotel's outlook would be an understatement. The check in was breezy with a warm welcoming service by the front office staff - now that's what I call hospitality. Although the room we got was located in the far corner, the room condition and facilities were simply breathtaking. The snacks provided were somewhat overwhelming but they tasted so well, that one would be stupid to resist. The Jacuzzi was a mind-blowing experience. As for the hotel service, I simply don't know how they do it, but they will be there at your doorstep literally seconds after you keep the phone. The restaurant and its management have won many accolades which they proudly display at the entrance. It was not before long that we realised why they receive them. The food is simply amazing with an endless spread. To walk around and have a look alone can fill you up. The flavours blend so well and they know how to exert the correct balance of tastes especially in local cuisines. The action stations were constantly full of action with a variety from prawns, sausages, bacon and waffles steaming continuously. Despite serious time restrictions and a house full of guests, the staff will go the extra mile just to see that smile on your face. The weekend extravaganza is something that one should not miss. On Fridays and Saturdays, the hotel features a cultural extravaganza with traditional and contemporary performances including the occasional fire limbo. Simply worth the time. The locality of the area features picteresque river boat rides to which the hotel also has some arrangements at additional cost. We could not make this journey, but previous experiences suggest that this cannot fail. The only option for improvement that I could think for the hotel is that it shows no signage for anyone plying from the South towards it. Whilst motorists from Colombo along the Galle Road (A2) would not miss the hotel sign, we travelled along the expressway (E1) to come up from south. Nearly missed the turn but managed not to overshoot it too much thanks to some roadside assistance. All in all, this was the first destination upon entering matrimony, and the warm service and comfortable outing at Heritance Ahungalla will be etched in our memories forever. A surefire revisiting option for us.",positive
"Reception staff were quite rude and took 2 hours to check us in. We were part of a large party and bookings were made some 6 months in advance of our arrival. One family of 4 were made wait in reception for over 3 hours before their room was available. Having said that the service staff, room attendants, waiters and bar staff were extremely accommodating and nothing was too much trouble. Rooms were not up to 5 star cleanliness and linen was worse than 1 star standard. Mini Bar was only refilled on request. The only thing 5 star about the hotel is the price and possibly the location, but be prepared to be pestered by hawkers as soon as you set foot on the beach.",negative

They live just across the way from the hotel in Station Road Ahungalla, everyone in the town knows them so they are easy to track down. We loved the place and can't wait to go back.",positive

"So much to say. The rooms were great, try for 3rd floor oceanview. The service was excellent. So many people to thank for our stay Klarathna, thushara, nerosh, varuna.. too many. Most particularly the front desk staff.. we toured sri lanka from Columbo to kandy to Penwalla to Nuwary Eliya to the hikkaduwa/batouna/Galle area. We had reservations with airbnb, and several hotels. When we arrived at the coast area we found none of the houses or hotels were anything like the websites depicted. All were filthy and trash strewn and very small. We came upon Heritance and were stunned . The hotel grounds are lush and clean, the pools were immaculate and the beach was clean large and perfect! There were multiple restaurants and bars on the grounds. There was entertainment . We stayed 4 days three nights and did not regret it. It should be said unless you a very comfortable with local foods and living conditions, this is the only hotel resort that offered a respite from the congestion and sanitary problems you may not be accustomed to. The hotel is also ideally centered between Columbo and Galle . We looked at almost every resort from Botouna to Galle, physically , while scrambling to find a place after being disgusted by our original ""resort"" this is far and away the best, by leaps and bounds . It is a five start resort at economy prices. ( we booked online in the lobby for a significantly reduced rate ) We also did half board which gave us breakfast and dinner. (We found this to be essential and we'll worth the little extra it cost) You will find the food choices were great and varied and the staff would accommodate any and all special requests. I wanted chicken noodle soup one night as opposed to the two choices and they made me a batch",negative
all though the hotel and people were very good we found that being only bed and breakfast we liked to go out to different restaurants in the evening which was a 20 minute ride away as there was not really anything closer.We felt that on the beach you were never left alone and if you went out of the complex you ran the gauntlet of the locals,neutral

The hotel staff are very hungry for tips (one waiter told me within a minute of meeting that he was the sole breadwinner for his family and he only earned 4,000 rupees a month). It gets oppressive. The cleaners come into your room (both sets, am and pm) and tell you they are the only person responsible for cleaning your room (and can I have a tip please! ). We were given only one mug, and there were a lot of mosquitos in the room. The toiletries are in refillable china containers and its impossible to get anything out of them. Food is very good but lunches and drinks very expensive. Gave us a lovely christmas eve meal and went to great efforts (ice sculptures and father christmas arriving in a boat.) Waited for ever for coffee in the morning. Not much to do when it rains and the water was too rough to go in the sea, plus you get hassled and followed on the beach. Could be so much better.",neutral

"Sadly, a disappointment",negative
"Though it's described as a five-star resort, my parents and I were sorely disappointed by this hotel and will not be returning. The cons: 1. The receptionist offered us the opportunity to upgrade to full-board or half-board at a discount (USD30 instead of USD25 per meal). When we asked which restaurants this was applicable for, they said that it was only for the main restaurant, but failed to mention that it was ONLY valid for the buffet. If we had known, we wouldn't have signed up for two days of buffet-only meals. We found out because the waiter told us we couldn't have ala carte, and all of this happened after we'd paid for half-board for two days. In addition to not being told exactly what we were paying for, we discovered that the buffer cost LKR3,700 (USD24.2). So you're telling me that I didn't receive a discount--I'm actually paying the full cost of the buffet AND I'm locked in for a two-day commitment. This was dishonest on the hotel's part, and according to our travel agent, they shouldn't be directly giving us discounts--they're supposed to go through the agent. All in all, very poor form on the hotel's part. 2. On the morning of our check-out date, my bathroom didn't have water. I couldn't use the sink, I couldn't shower; it's a good thing I didn't have to flush anything. I checked my dad's room next door - also no water. It took two calls for housekeeping for the water to come back. How is this acceptable? 3. Our room had an odd smell that came from the bathroom drain. When we told the GRO, she said housekeeping would be around shortly to attend to it. They arrived 18 hours later. 4. When we first arrived, there was no porter to be found and we waited a solid few minutes before the receptionist noticed that we wanted to check in with our bags. He then rushed out and seemed very frazzled. Out of the 7 hotels we stayed in Sri Lanka, this was by far the poorest reception we'd received. The pros: 1. The restaurant staff were lovely, warm and attentive. My mum had a broken arm on this trip and the chef himself came out and helped her take food for the buffet and then walked her to her table. 2. They provide comfortable flip flops for guests to use on the beach and around the property. 3. The food was delicious. Every dish we had was delicious--both Sri Lankan and international fare.",negative

It was quite small and old and definitely wasn't maintained properly. Cleanliness of the room was not up to par for the price I paid especially during the peak holiday season. From table tops to curtains to the wash room, here was dust all over as if it was not cleaned in months. I had to clean the blow dryer with a wet tissue to get the dirt out before using it! There was also a very old TV in the room. Food was okay, not great but the staff was very friendly and very helpful. It makes your stay a worthy one against all odds. There are two great pools and a garden with a lot of trees. Well maintained and the pool staff was very friendly and helpful.

"4 of us stayed here from the 7th to the 18th of January. We had originally booked the Turyya Hotel , also 5 STAR , but had a call from our tour operator MERCURY to see if we wanted to change to the Heritance because the Turyya had been downgraded to a 4 Star Hotel due to a lot of complaints. We were happy to book into the Heritance . But did not have the good experience that we had expected. Our rooms were quite dirty . So much so that my daughter cleaned her room with a packet of Babywipes. My Husband did some cleaning with a towel . I refused to do so . I do not think that this should be part of my Holiday. Then we checked our pillows and duvet and had a big shock. We took our bedding to the lobby and were quickly ushered in to a back room . After complaining we were offered an , as the Manager called it , an upgraded room. We were taken to have a look at the room and were happy to move in to it . It was actually exactly the same room as the dirty one but newly decorated with a new shower etc. Before we moved in to the new room the manager asked would it be Ok if he would go and check the bedding . Of course we agreed . At around 11 o'clock I heard loud voices from my daughters room . I went to see what was going on and again the bedding was dirty . Duvet cover had a big brown stain on it and one of the pillows had mould all over it. The manager told us "" that is why we put 2 pillow cases on it "" OH DEAR !!!!!! But after that , I must praise the boys who cleaned our room , everything was spotless. The next day at mealtimes we were surprised that the restaurant staff seemed to be totally confused . It was a bit like FAULY TOWERS . There were other issues but it would take to long to mention them all . Would we come back to this Hotel . absolutely not , never ever .",negative

"When we entered the room, we complained about the smell of mould - the hotel did nothing. We had paid for this hotel nine months previously and we were now trapped. At dinner that night - we were asked how our soup was - and we honestly advised there was too much salt (another freshly made batch was produced). Twenty-four hours later, I was screaming at a lady from Guest Relations, the Food and Beverage Manager and the Housekeeping Manager, all standing in our room, (yes at this stage they were willing to change rooms - why I cried, you did nothing 24 hrs ago when I complained.) So they said we were being upgraded to Fine Dining - oh really, we had already paid for an evening meal, So we went for a snack, then slept. (The night before there had been a graduation - that's where the blood came from - and our future leaders had a wonderful noisy night). Upon checkout I was asked if I would like to complete a feedback form - oh dear, you really want me to write about our experience and state that we had to pay for our food. To her credit, she ran and my husband was given back the money he had just paid - and I received two bottles of water. The photos speak for themselves. Five star accommodation - I don't think so.",negative
"Working in the Hotel Industry myself, this is an experience I havent made before. I contacted the Hotel over 2 months ago, asking for an offer for a Family of 4 and myself for 4 days, Half Board. - used the Website mail: no answer - used the contact form: no answer - sent a mail to the Reservation department: no answer - Called the Hotel: was given another mail address: no answer - called again, persisted on the Reservation department directly: Reservation Agent (Trevin von Gunster) confirmed that he saw my mails from 10 days before, but was ´´too busy´´ to answer. - received an offer for 3 people, not 5, as requested - asked for a Change, over a week: no answer - called again: same person, apologies again, promised a new offer - receive a new confirmation, again for 3 adults, Kids missing - asked for a Change: since the 29th of November: no answer. I am trying since roughly 6 weeks to make a 2.500 Dollar booking, have spend hours and significant amounts on phone calls to Sri Lanka, have been kicked out of line repeatedly by the reception, have sent dozens of mails by now, and the result is: Zero. Absolutely astonishing.",negative

"Driven by excellent previous experiences we had at Heritance Kandalama, we booked a 3 nights’ half-board stay at Ahungalla with similar expectations: that we will receive a service in accordance to a 5 stars hotel, customer oriented and with attention to detail. But unfortunately this was not the case. With the exception of the reception staff who was very friendly and efficient, the rest was below the average, especially at the main restaurant. On more than one occasion had to make exaggerated gestures to catch the waiters’ attention and had to repeat our order of water and or coffee during breakfast and dinner. The used plates were often not removed, so we either had to again make exaggerated gestures to get the assistance of a waiter or make room ourselves. On top of that, getting the food from the buffet was quite a stressful experience by having to dodge tables, chairs and people (it was way too crowded!). Likewise, we faced a similar situation at the infinity pool bar. Given that the waiter was taking too long to come –we opted for standing up and going to the bar too make our order. Then we had to do a similar thing to get the bill as well. It was also quite unfortunate that the bar from the guests’ pool was not operative and no equipment was provided to get a better use of the lovely beach (lounge chairs and sunshades). A real pity, we expected much more from what it used to be such an iconic hotel.",negative
"I have been to Heritance Ahungalla many many times. It is a second home to my family and my first choice for a family holiday, for an office trip or for a corporate training event. The difference at Heritance Ahungalla is the consistency in service and the courtesy and assistance extended by all, from the GM to a steward or housekeeping staff. Very innovative in everything they do, excellent rooms and delightful cuisine. I will never forget the 'ice-cream sandwich' served after an outdoor training session I had Heritance. The welcome and the departure is equally warm, which is not common - Gihan Talgodapitiya",positive
rooms on the bottom floor are a good deal but not the ones on the furthest from the reception. It&#39;s creepy walking all the way at night :-(,neutral
"We stayed here for 2 weeks at the end of March and first week of April. Mostly, I would agree the previous writer's review. If you wish to really see Sri Lanka then I would suggest that you stay here at the end of your holiday as it is quite far south and means that travel to places such as Kandy are extremely long and tiresome and the driving is something else to be seen, I would describe it as a 'white knuckle ride'!. The hotel is well designed but I would struggle to place it in the 4-5* bracket (try out hotels in Malaysia and you will really see the difference). There is a so called shop in the hotel which really does not sell any essentials such as shampoo so make sure you take your own hair products. Also, we bought factor 40 sun tan cream which did not work and we were severely burned (another couple had the same experience) so again, make sure you take your own sun tan creams and after sun with you. Regarding the beach terrorists, they do hassle you. We were followed for an hour on the beach by 5 of them who just would not give up, no matter how politely you said you weren't interested. They called and shouted to you if you were sunbathing near the beach and the only thing to do was to completely ignore them. One day we went outside the hotel to go the the pharmacy to buy some after sun lotion (due to the rubbish cream the shop had sold) and found exactly the same hassle, we lasted about 20 minutes before going back to the hotel. Our room smelled damp when we initially entered and the air con never seemed cool, the staff knocked on the door daily, sometimes 4-5 times to check the room was ok. However, I think this had more to do with wanting a tip. One time they completely ignored the 'do not disturb sign' and still persisted. The restaurant did offer a very good selection (buffet style) and quality of food, the only thing that let it down was the length of time it took you to get a drink when requested, especially as the ratio of staff to customers was overwhelming at times. If you don't like being hassled then maybe this isn't the place for you. In terms of the staff, all were very friendly and polite apart from one or two who seemed to have tipping on their agenda as a priority more than genuine customer service. All in all, a good quality hotel but if they really wish to put themselves in the 4-5* bracket, they are missing a lot of extras which you would normally expect.",negative
Fantastic beach but they do not allow sun loungers and shades on the sand. I have been told the hotel does not encourage you to use the beach in case locals come along trying to sell items. This to date is our only complaint.,neutral

"We ended our tour around Sri Lanka with a couple of nights at the Heritance Ahungalla. The hotel is well situated by the beach and we enjoyed walking along the shore watching the ocean roll in. We arrived with high expectations given all the five star reviews, but our experience did not live up to this. The bathroom in our room was disappointing for a 5 star hotel - small, bare plaster (not sure whether the room was being redecorated or this was the intended 'vibe') and the door wedged on the floor every time you tried to open it. The handle came off a drawer in the bedroom as the staff showed us the room when we checked in. On a positive note, breakfasts were buffet style with a very wide selection. Rather than accept the 'special offer' to upgrade to half board on arrival, we ate a la carte for dinners which meant we could choose what we wanted and this turned out to be much more cost effective than the half board offer/buffet. When we ate at the Mustard the place was very quiet, but we were rushed by the waiting staff - main courses arriving when we were half through our starters and left on the table, and dessert offered and our plates whipped away as we enjoyed the last mouthful of main course. Why the experience had to be rushed when the place was far from busy I don't know, perhaps the service could be most generously described as 'over eager'. This is a good hotel in a nice location. Staff were friendly. Just a few things which meant that our experience was not 5 star.",neutral
"We were staying there at the New Year 2012/2013. In real, we didnt choose this hotel, it had choosen us)) of the mistake in booking of our touroperator. Some persons of staff were very polient and helpful. Breakfast could be more various and tasteful, I think. Prices for dinners were too high and we didnt take it. Nice beach, but there are a lot of local people, who always wanted you to buy something. Somebody of them could be really crazy, so please, dont walking alone by yourself at the beach. Rooms are nice, but it needed renovation in parts. There are not directly view at the ocean, but in the garden there are a lot of funny animals. Probably for somebody it is nice place, but I am nor sure that we would like to return there again.",neutral

"We came to this hotel for a couple of days of rest and sun at the end of a two week tour of Sri Lanka. I have to admit it was my least favourite hotel. Yes there was lots of opportunity for sunbathing around the pool. The men were very attentive with keeping the grounds immaculate and bringing mattresses and towels. Also the bars were located around the grounds so drink was easy to obtain. But despite this being a hotel designed to blend with nature, I found the stark long corridors austere and unfriendly, and very noisy. In fact they echoed any noise particularly in the early mornings. In the restaurant there were far fewer waiters than previously and those that were in attendance were much less attentive. And the entertainment was a mixed bag. We saw a delightful cultural show followed by a very amateurish fire show. Positives? Lovely large rooms. The quietest air con ever. Great range of food. Lovely location on a pristine beach.",negative
"We stayed at this hotel for twelve days and expected more from a hotel with a deluxe reputation. The greatest asset this hotel has are its staff. They were simply excellent, so very friendly, exceptionally eager to please and polite and courteous at all times. You would find it difficult to find a better hotel staff anywhere. The food in the buffet restaurant was of a high standard and a perfect mix of Sri Lankan and International dishes. The food in the fine dining restaurant was even better and probably better than manyy top restaurants in London. The hotel is located right on the beach andmost of the rooms have a great sea view. There are many beach venders, but we did not find this too much a problem as they quickly learnt not to bother you once you made it clear you were not interested. Yes, there are many positives to this hotel, but unfortunately it does not deserve a deluxe rating. First impression are so important and this hotel is let down by being in need of care and attention. For example the furnishings in the public areas were stained and needed replacing and much of the woodwork needed attention. The tablecloths in the dining room were frequently filthy (unacceptable and easily rectified) and all the linen needed to be renewed. Many of the sunbeds were broken and needed replacing and wer covered with dirty matresses. However, the pool attendents were excellent and helped to make up for these problems. Our overall impression of this hotel was that it required significant investment to bring it up to an acceptable standard for a deluxe hotel. The hotel is saved by its excellent staff and fabulous food; two of the most impotant factors for a successful hotel. Would we return, possibly, but only if standards were improved. There are many boutique hotels opening in Sri Lanka and the Heritance needs to be able to match the very high standard that these hotels set.",negative
"One of four Heritance hotels we stayed in during a ten day tour. Large and has good architecture and enviable position on the beach this Hotel does lack the attention to detail that others had. No welcome drinks or towels which though not a deal breaker was noticeable because when we mentioned it the promised drinks later did not appear. The dining room was large but you were left to find out for yourself that half the breakfast buffet was in the quieter other room. Beach beds were placed by someone who seemed to feel the tired faded towels were far too precious to distribute. We had a good time but did not feel the staff overall were well motivated.We would return again to any of the others ie Kandalama, Earls Regency, and theTea Factory but would probably give this one a miss next time. Amazingly the A la Carte restaurant was not able to secure many or any takers on Valentines evening. We never felt the hotel was geared up to making guests feel special.The rooms were fine but some public areas do need a makeover. If you have a Mirror Lounge its probably a good idea to replace the rusting mirrored ceiling which detracts from the ambience.",neutral

"I have just returned form 10 days at the Heritance with my girlfriend and can honestly say there wasnt any aspect fo the hotel that was disappointing. I work for a top tour operator in england and have travelled around the world staying at many top hotels. The service at the Heritance matched, if not exceeded many of these. The pools were fantastic...clean, great suze and we had one of the two at leat to ourselves on many occasions..it was great!! Below are some further comments: Room - was brilliant. It was a great size, really nicely furnished, clean with a great bathroom. Great views to pool and ocean. Cleaned daily. Food - amazing! we were on ahalf board basis and te food was superb. Great choice, different them every day, fresh, beautiful curries! Service - amazing. The staff were so attentive it was incredible. They were polite and friendly all the time. They alwas say hello and and make a real rapport with you throughout the time we were there. Beach - lovely but you do get hounded a bit by the touts when you walk on it. Just ignore them if you want them to leave you alone. Theyre firendly though. The sea is a bit rough so you cant really swim in it. Touts - if you want to get a taxi just ask one of the touts for a tuk tuk Its so much cheaper than the hotel taxis. We had the same driver for the whole 10 days and he was great. He took us to lots of places cheaply and was a safe driver. Dont be scared to use one..youll probably be a bit nervous the first time you get in one but then you can get their number and as soon as you want to go somewheer give them a call and theyll come and pick you up. Overall..couldnt fault our time at the heritance in any way. Ive read some of the negative reviews on this site and cant really understand what theyre on about. One said this hotel was dated which is complete rubbish! Feel free to email me if you have any questinos or want to know more. Nick",negative

"Checked into the hotel on the Christmas Day. The hotel has a very nice feel but just don't carried away with the ambience. Our first couple of in room dining orders were very disappointing.

The hotel looks stunning offers great views.We had booked the premium rooms sea facing. We found the service lacking in all aspects.From the rooms check in to the restaurant service. We were quite displeased with the hotel. I had planned a surprise for my husband and had requested the hotel for a cake and for the room to be decorated and offered to pay extra for the same. I had called and re-confirmed this more than three times. I had called in even three hours before check-in to ensure this is done. I was assured it would be done before we arrived. We came to the hotel and the front desk staff intimated that they never received any such request. Since it was a surprise it turned out to be quite a spoiler. Though the room was nice. We were given one with twin mattresses. We had to repeatedly request for a change in room with at least a queen mattress.(So much for an anniversary). We were told the hotel was running full.So we would be given a room change the next day.It never happened.Quite disappointing. Even the service in the restaurant was appalling none of the waiters bother to even keep the cutlery on the table after we have taken out plates or serve us even drinking water we had to repeatedly request for it.Being a 5-star hotel we were surprised at the dismal service. I might not consider the property again solely for the lack of service. Also the restaurants lack a choice of vegetarian food. especially the fine dinning restaurants does not serve any vegetarian food. even on request.We we forced to use the buffet every time.Which also has limited options.Disappointed again. We would not recommend this to others.,negative

This is my 2nd time at the hotel. We were allocated a spacious room. The hotel was at full capacity. The F& B managers were very good and helpful. The rooms were clean but I felt the housekeeping service lacked quite a bit. There was a cultural show and many kids activities. On the downside I was a little annoyed when the hotel had left a letter under my door reminding me about our check out for the next day. I had paid in full for both days and I feel such a reminder was not required. A family friendly hotel overall.,positive

"We booked for 2 nights unexpectedly as the election curfew messed with our original plans. The resort was mostly empty. It's not a full all-inclusive, meaning some guests pay a la carte. For the all-inclusive, the selection is OK - local spirits and a short list of cocktails. Wine is only served in the restaurant at lunch and dinner, which is weird. Food was good, but couldn't help the feeling that because it was not fully occupied the choice wasn't all there. The pool is nice, the beach is nearby (but not really a great beach, some serious surf). Rooms were OK, very clean, wifi was fast and the overall experience positive. Staff were extremely friendly and welcoming, which helped a lot. The gym was also a welcome addition - nothing big or fancy but there to be used, which is always a nice touch.",neutral

We were at heritance ahugalla for Two days on the 21st and 22nd of June 2014. While the other aspects of our stay was satisfatory the food was HORRIBLE and maybe even nearing on Atrocious!! In all meals the food was actually flavor less... the worst part is that most of us had to suffer from food poisoning and purging the same day! I will definitely never visit this hotel again and will definitely advise all of my friends and family to never go there even if it was the last place on earth!! solely because there was something that was seriously wrong with the food in that hotel So please if anyone of you are thinking of going there... Think again,negative
"First the good bits: pool and beach here are gorgeous. Staff are all excellent and try very hard. That's it for the good bits This hotel is on desperate need of an upgrade to claim its 5 star rating. 5 star this is not. Tired rooms, leaking shower, bath that did not drain , mouldy screens etc. Lobby bathrooms - 2 out if 3 cubicles no lighting, doors did not lick and paint chipping off the doors. The food here is ok. If you are looking for a good 3.5 star hotel then this is fine but we have stayed in many other so called luxury hotels on this trip and they were all way above this hotel in terms of fit out and upkeep . They do many things really well here but 5 star lodgings it is not.",negative
"Heritance Ahungalla would be a great location for a couples retreat, provided they make a few improvements. The hotel is situated in a slightly secluded area (15-20 minutes away from Galle city), is a heart-warming relic of colonial era architecture, and has a marvelous private beach and other relevant amenities. However, it can become even better if the service quality is improved. I had a bitter experience checking in as I waited for almost half an hour before anyone attended me, and even then it took the staff forever to complete the formalities. One would generally expect the staff of a 5-star hotel to be more competent and efficient. Moreover, the staff seemed confused when I asked them for advice on travelling around Galle. I stayed in a twin sharing room (I was there on a conference). While the room was nice, the bathroom seemed a little worn down and I felt needed to be revamped.",neutral

"My husband and I are seasoned travellers to Sri Lanka and the Indian sub-continent. We are just finishing a 4 week trip to probably one of the best hotels on the Island if you are looking for a beach holiday. Without exception all the staff are absolutely wonderful - if only we could 'bottle' their smile before returning to the UK? The management readily admit that they need to update the bedrooms and public areas of the hotel but this in no way detracts from the amazing stay you will have from the minute you arrive until the very last minute before you leave. All staff are worthy of mention but as we do not have room to name them all, 3 in particular will ensure your stay remains not just an experience but a long lasting memory (KK Restaurant Manager; Nihal Restaurant Supervisor and Saman (our houseboy for Room 102). The lifeguards at the poolside also deserve a mention; not all guests are easy to deal with but they remain polite and cheerful whatever the guest request! The hotel, originally designed by Geoffrey Bauer has pride of place on a wide, long stretch of sandy and 'sun bed free' beach. Part of me doesn't want to write this review and to share my holiday with you - the only reason being we don't want lots of people to spoil it!! So enjoy - you will not be disappointed and if you are wondering if we will return - of course!",positive

"The hotel looked amazing when we arrived and we were upgraded to a fantastic suite which we were very happy with. The beach was long and wide however the sea is rough so don't expect to do too much swimming in there. Having stayed in a few other Heritance hotels during our visit to Sri Lanka we were pretty expectant when it came to the food at Heritance Ahungalla if nothing else, but we were let down here. There was not enough to choose from which was our main issue. Another bug bear was how the hotel allowed women in niqabs to swim in the hotel pools, not the type designed to be worn for swimming which of course I have no issue with. Despite these relatively small complaints we had a very relaxing stay and would recommend the hotel.",neutral
"Am avut upgrade de camera gratuit, obtinut prin booking, insa pentru ei asta insemna sa ne dea aceeai camera, doar ca la un etaj superior. Dupa ce am stat 3 ore in receptie am reusit sa obtinem camera conform rezervarii, insa nu are legatura cu pozele. Mucegai in camera. Pretul de 250 de dolari pe noapte este exagerat pentru o camera cu tavanul plin de mucegai. Mancarea nu este chiar buna. Peste pretul din meniu se va adauga: 10% servicii, 3% alte taxe si peste toate astea (pretul de baza + 10% + 3%) se adauga tva de 18% la toata suma.

"This is meant to be a 5 star hotel, but is lacking in so many areas. The positives first. The restaurant staff and room cleaning staff were excellent. The rooms are very nice, spacious and beds are extremely comfortable. Unfortunately the reception staff and management were extremely unhelpful and didn’t address issues when highlighted. We visited during Sri Lankan new year and we knew shops and restaurants would be closed, we asked the reception staff and were advised Fri and sat (which is what we expected) I also asked if they knew if restaurants in Galle would be open on the Sunday and was advised they would all be closed as still new year so better to stay at the hotel. This was incorrect as a discovered through a Facebook forum and visited Galle on the Sunday were all restaurants were open. This felt like an attempt to keep you in the hotel spending money. The prices at the hotel were also questionable. The hotel we stayed in the week before had clear pricing on there menu eg Nani goreng 1800 Sri Lankan rupees. The heritance menu do 10% state service charge to be added, but also to be added is 18% vat meaning the prices stated which were already at least 20% higher than the previous 5star rated hotel we had stayed in were much more costly than other similarly rated hotels and more concerningly this isn’t clear. The pools open at 8am which is fine as they need to clean them, but the bed cover and towels aren’t available until 8am and as I am an early riser and like to get up and spend some time in the sun before breakfast and the sun gets too hot this was disappointing. Also out of the 5 nights we stayed here I had to trek around the resort on 3 separate days to find a pool attendant as you can’t get the mattress and towels yourself, having gone to reception on 2 occasions it took until 9 am on 2 of the days to get the towels and mattresses, and all the manager Clive could do was apologise, which given it happened again the following morning was very poor. The issue clearly hadn’t been addressed. Also around the pool, wasn’t cleaned with cigarette ends (dissapointing that’s scruffy guests leave this is the first place) plastic bottles and beer caps left on the grass for the last 4 days we were there. I would not recommend this hotel to stay at and instead would highly recommend the 5 star Taj Bentota which is only 20 minutes away and is excellent with much more around the hotel as well which if you want to explore is great.",negative

"Heritance Ahungalla is always our first choice when I and my partner visit Sri Lanka. I have stayed in this hotel more than 20 times over the last few years and, there is nothing else in Sri Lanka to beat its architectural beauty, tranquility, beautiful sandy beaches, friendly staff and their hospitality, and great food choices. All our work stresses and worries just disappear into the thin air as soon as we walk into the lobby of the hotel for the first time. Friendly welcome from the staff and the glance of the hotel environment with the infinity pool and the sound of the sea waves set the tone for the rest of our holiday. We love to come to Herritance to celebrate Christmas and the New Year since they organise a fabulous dinner with amazing food buffet with ice sculptures and food decorations which is out of this world, dance shows, fireworks and music by a great band. This experience is heavenly under the stars with the sound of the sea. What is unbeatable in this hotel, compared to other hotels in Sri Lanka, is the friendliness and the quality of the staff who works their. This goes from the General Manager to all the managers, to the waiters who serve at the restaurant, to the cleaning staff, and to the pool staff. They are always their to do their best to make our stay a memorable experience. I would like to give a special mention to Duminda and Waruna at the restaurant who always made sure we have an amazing dinning experience. Rukmal, the towel artist, make fabulous animal figures with towels and surprise us every morning as we come back to our room after breakfast. Pool attendants are always there to prepare our sun-beds every morning. We love walking along the sandy beach in front of the hotel in the morning and also in the evening and enjoy the evening sunset and then dive into the pool for a final swim before getting ready for the dinner. One day we wanted to organise a special dinner on the beach for a friend and his family to celebrate his retirement. The staff went out of their way to organise this dinner with fabulous food and assigned dedicated staff to serve the food. It was an unforgettable experience. I recommend this for couples if you are interested in organising a romantic dinner or for any special events to mark the occasion. I hope to be back again in the summer to re-live this beautiful experience.",positive

Two nights at Heritance was definitely not enough. great food comfortable accommodation and just great location. The hotel was full due the been so close to christmas.

Construction=some new parts and some dilapidated parts,neutral
"Room was average considering we had told them it was our honeymoon. Food was not up to par when comparing with other hotels in Sri Lanka until we spoke to one of the chefs who made us a traditional Sri Lankan curry and brought it to our table. Think they try to cater for far too many people instead of sticking to traditional dishes. We were told that it would be good for snorkelling but the sea is too rough all year round. Better snorkelling a few miles down the coast. Staff were useless at bringing drinks. Could take an awful long time waiting. We got bored with the bar and mundane entertainment and walked along the beach to a ramshackle hut called The Sunset Bar where we were given a warm welcome by the locals who run this place. Ending up dancing on the sand. Soooooooooooooooo much better than listening to polite, elevator music back at the hotel!! Wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone and wouldn't go back. There are much better hotels around.",negative

I visited this hotel few months ago. Foods really good and love the rooms as well.but hotel staff only care about foreign customers .they don’t think about Sri Lankan customers . I don’t know why they are doing this for Sri Lankan but management should think about this otherwise you will lose Sri Lankan customers because of your staff . But hotel is very clean and rooms also.

If you want to taste Sri Lankan cuisine in a big hotel, this is lovely place to go. Plus they have really coffee which is a big yes to me.",positive
As the heading the meals were above five star and the variety was excellent. We reserved a Suite thinking that there will be a DVD Player which is very comman nowadays. But it was not available.

Die Fotos, die das Hotel eingestellt hat, geben nicht den Zustand des Hotels wieder, -->Hochglanzfotos. Ich hatte Wasserflecken an der Decke und auch sonst ist das Zimmer an der ein oder anderen Stelle nicht mehr ansehnlich gewesen. Es benötigt, meiner Ansicht nach, dringend einer Renovierung. Das Essensangebot bzw. die Auswahl, in Büfett-Form, schwankte sehr je nachdem wie voll das Hotel war. Das gilt auch für das Frühstück. Sprich, je weniger Gäste, desto weniger Angebot.

"Our room at the hotel was very impressive but sadly quite noisy. You could hear everything from the corridors and in the room above. The hotel itself was a bit tired. The green swimming pool was amazing and usually quite quiet but the main pool was very busy all the time and with lots of children playing games so it was not very peaceful. The setting is lovely and the beach is really very beautiful, we enjoyed spending time on it. The staff were well meaning and friendly however we did have a few issues. I think perhaps not all of what we said/asked was understood but instead of asking to clarify they said yes and just said of course, no problem. This meant that we had a couple of situations which left us with problems. We booked a PCR test and expressly asked if the cost could be charged to our room. We were told that this was fine and no problem, then when we came to do the test we were told we needed to pay in cash which we did not have. The hotel did. It do anything to help and we found ourselves roaming the streets in the midday heat desperately trying to find a cash machine and very stressed. We also arranged a late check out which we had to pay for. We agreed this and then confirmed it the next day. Despite this on the day of check out we got a call saying we needed to vacate the room. We queried this and confirmed what we had arranged previously and were told they didn’t have anything on their system and we would need to clear our room straight away but they could put us in another room. We were not packed or prepared for this and the whole thing turned out last day into a really stressful and ruined day.",negative
Same as kandalama heritance also have poor hospitality. They don't care about customers. They act like we came to stay and eat there for free. 😂.

Place with direct access to the beach, the ocean is rights next to the hotel. Fantastic, colonial style hotel. I give high marks to this place. Sincerely recommend!",positive

"Well, if you like a large noisy hotel with shabby rooms and indifferent food, then this is the place for you. On the plus side the beach is pristine, and the inexperienced staff try their best. BUT it is a very large hotel which opens its doors to day trippers at the weekend, so the pool is full of screaming children. In the morning you cannot sit by the main pool because of the noise from speakers accompanying aerobics - ugh. The rooms are decorated in the bare plaster look which does not stand up to wear and tear. The food is average if you like buffets at specific times. A la carte is mainly burger and chips with variations. The prices for food are higher than the Hilton in Colombo, and what really annoyed me the most was that the hotel write up proports to show this as a 5* establishment, with prices to match when in fact I have stayed in many rest houses with better facilities.",neutral
"We checked into the hotel the day before a public holiday. Following day while chatting to a waiter he said there is going to be a huge crowd for lunch hence come by 12:30. Apparently they were going to have about 350 day visitors when the restaurant can accommodate only 175. We had breakfast around 9:00, and no way we could eat again at 12:30. We had no choice but to cut short the holiday and go home. How can a hotel treat its in house guests like this? Instead they should have arranged lunch for day visitors in a separate hall. Everything else was ok.",negative

"Arrived after an amazing tour to be greeted with a poor reception by hotel staff.Not shown to the room ,two green pools full of algae unable to see bottom of pool.room was sufficient but superficially cleaned, no welcome fruit staff rude , lazy as this is an all inclusive for other countries paying guests are ignored but they stillcharge service charge. Lack of sunbeds but pool staff reserve for tipping guests. Children allowed to run wild everywhere even in the restaurants. Covid restrictions dismal and guests not challenged despite Sri Lanka still insisting on mask wearing. Only one bar open despite advertising all facilities available…. Avoid this hotel as a well travelled guest this deserves at best a 3 star rating.",neutral
The dinner options were almost the same as the lunch options. This might be due to the fact that it was Sunday and there were only few guests,neutral
"Our problem started upon our arrival when we were told that we had been upgraded to a luxury room, but it turned out to be an isolated one (at the very end of the hotel) with a view on tennis courts. In addition, the room contained only 2 beds (One queen-sized and another “Extra” bed). As we had explicitly requested (and confirmed twice with our travel agent) a room with 3 beds and a sea view, we made this clear to the staff member who showed us the room. After she spent some time on the phone, she referred us to the manager on duty( Srinath A ). This manager was beyond rude and impatient, immediately telling us that there were no other rooms available for us to change, because apparently we had checked in late (6 pm). Brushing aside this unprofessionalism, we peacefully requested a refund, in order to be available to switch hotels and find what we are looking for elsewhere. At this point, the manager refused and defiantly told us: “We don’t have money at the hotel. Talk to your travel agent to get money, and go''. After spending 3 hours in the lobby and threatening to escalate if we were not refunded our money right away, suddenly and magically, a suite became available for us to move into, which uncovered the lies that were being told before about the hotel being fully-booked. Such dishonesty and disrespect is not worthy of a 5-star hotel.",negative
"Have just returned from 2 weeks at the Heritance and overall it was a disappointing experience, primarily because the service was so mixed, ranging from good, to indifferent, to frankly poor. My wife and I travelled with our 13 year old son, and we stayed in 2 adjacent luxury rooms, which were slightly tired, but extremely spacious, and thoroughly cleaned every day. A word of warning to anyone travelling with younger children, we had made 3 advance requests via our Tour Operator ""Kuoni"", for inter connecting rooms. We received no reply, and were only advised on arrival that the hotel has no interconnecting rooms. The 2 hotel pools are large and well maintained, one offering some limited organised activities and the other residents' pool offering a quieter option. The hotel and grounds are spacious, and even though the hotel was fully occupied for part of our stay, it never felt over crowded. We had opted for bed and breakfast, so didn't experience the buffet, all inclusive option. However a few of our fellow guests did and commented that the food was good quality, but repetitive if staying for 2 weeks. We mainly ate in the Coffee Shop restaurant where the food was good, and given a supposed 5 star hotel, we thought the prices were reasonable. Dining out options in the village of Ahungalla are non existent. If you walk out of the hotel complex, you are quickly surrounded by several locals, offering TukTuk rides, boat safaris, and numerous trips. They are persistent but never threatening, and several firm "" no thank you"" will usually see them retreat. The village does have a pharmacy and a bank. If you are cashing travellers cheques, it is worth the 5 minute stroll to the bank as it offers a significantly better exchange rate than the hotel. For dining out you need to get a taxi or a TukTuk to Bentota or else to HIkkaduwa. Bentota has several hotels and is 20 minutes in a taxi or about 25/30 minutes in a TukTuk. The drivers will wait for you and negotiate a return trip price. A hotel taxi was about £20 for a return trip, with the tuktuks costing about half of that. The best restaurant we found was the Golden Grill, good for curries and seafood. Dinner for 3 people with beer and soft drinks was typically £30 to £40 in total. Main frustration came with the inconsistent service in the hotel. At breakfast, there was a great range of food, and all well presented, and plenty of staff on hand. Unfortunately it wasn't unusual for 3 different waiters to approach you to ask whether we wanted tea or coffee, but then none of them would get round to serving it. The pool attendants are helpful but want tipping continually and the room cleaners changed several times and all made subtle overtures for tips. Reception staff were always smiling, but poorly trained and inefficient with simple requests having to be made several times before anything got done. After the first week we found a great guy working reception and just made sure we dealt with him. Some lovely staff serving drinks around the pool, always friendly and helpful. Wandering onto the beach is spoilt because the locals will lie in wait and then follow you round trying to sell you gouges or trips. They will ask your name and if you give it, they will stand at the edge of the hotel property calling to you while you try and relax on your sun bed. Again they aren't threatening in any way, just persistent and something of a pain. Just keep saying ""no thank you"" and they will eventually give up ! Overall, the Heritance is nice but dated hotel, but represents pretty reasonable value for what it is. The location is isolated but the grounds and pools are good, and the rooms are fine. It has the potential to offer a relaxed, get away from it all style resort, IF the management could get their act together and get the service to a consistently efficient level.",negative

I stayed at this hotel a few years ago and the food was amazing then but this time the food was very average. I got a rotten taste in one of the meat items. The jacuzzis in the pool area were not working also. Overall it was a bad experience because we had high expectations compared to the last stay. Nevertheless, we liked the rooms very much. It was very clean.",neutral
Take your chances.,positive
We stayed here for 4 nights following a tour of the national parks of Sri Lanka. The hotel was of a good standard and the food in the restaurants was excellent. The pool was good and the welcome from the staff was great. The only negative point is that the beach attached to the hotel is public and as such has a lot of hawkers on it who will not leave you alone although this is the same on a lot of Sri Lanka's beeches. Even in the monsoon season when we went (could not swim in sea due to its roughness) it was a good break after a tour and i would recommend it to anyone for a short break. Any longer than 5 days however may get boring as there is nothing in the local village.,positive

"I visited this property for a destination family wedding and while the rooms, all beach facing and the property was great with the really nice swimming pools, the service levels expected for this category of hotel was severely lacking. We were 3 of us staying in a suite and we were categorically declined to be given another cinamon gel soap (they only give one for your entire stay) and we had to fight for extra drinking water, considering there was an extra person in the room. We had a housekeeping guy who was downright rude and hellbent on proving us wrong. Apart from this even refusal for giving us food from the buffet since we were late or allowing us to sit in the restaurant and eat. The point is that the staff blindly followed rules and did not care about customer service at all. Not once have they gone out of their way to help us feel comfortable.",negative

And the shower gel, conditioner and Shampoo had no labels so we had trial and test to see what was what. So frustrating!! Nevertheless they made up with the amazing location absolutely amazing service and great spread for both breakfast and lunch as that's what we had. Ordered room service for dinner which was apt but they overkilled on the French fries!! I'd recommend you guys to go for the ambiance and location and hopefully if they correct these small issues you have a killer deal!! Cheers!",negative

"More recently, we had a rest with a group of friends at the Heritance Ahungalla hotel on the island of Sri Lanka. The impressions were the most pleasant. The hotel is very comfortable, clean, tidy and beautiful. The window offers a stunning view of the ocean, there are many vegetation and animals around. In the morning you wake up to a variety of singing amazing, exotic birds. And when you leave your room for breakfast, you can see a family of monkeys, which is located on the branches of the nearest trees. A very funny sight. There were no problems with food, as there are dishes of both local and more familiar cuisine for us. Another pleasant feature of the hotel is that the beach is located some 100 meters from the hotel. Since during our trip there was quarantine in the country, nevertheless, we did not feel any inconvenience, because the ocean was within walking distance. I would also like to mention the staff of the pool bar and in particular Mr. Darshana. Very nice person, brilliant employee and very friendly guy. Always ready to serve and help. In general, I liked the rest very much. I hope I will come here at least one more time.",positive

"We have just returned from a three week stay at the Heritance Hotel. Hotel was basically good, everything worked, including the staff who, if anything, could be overly attentive. Rooms were stylish, had plenty of storage space and were serviced twice daily. Balconies had views across the beach to the setting sun. Some guests complained of minor faults, e.g. our fridge broke down but was repaired the same morning. Food was a good as could be expected with Buffet Service and we were never bored, although the dining room could be noisy. The hotel is proud of its swimming pools and rightly so. Attentive pool boys and life guards ensure there is not the usual scramble for beds and towels. We actually preferred the second (residents) pool to that shown in all the literature. The beach was regularly cleaned and patrolled. Constant slight surf, no problems for even moderate swimmers but small children should be supervised. The hotel’s main drawback is its isolation. Locally, there is simply nowhere to go and little to do. Ahungalla village consists of some 70 yards of dilapidated shacks selling local produce and a few basics at blatantly ’tourist’ and local prices. There is also a passable bakery, a pharmacy, a bank with no ATM and a railway station at which few trains actually stop. There are two bus services and two qualities of bus i.e. Air Conditioned and Local. It is difficult to ascertain what is a public bus, as opposed to touring or private hire and even more difficult to have them stop. Heritance guests are not expected to want to walk anywhere, let alone get on a bus. The weather was good. It rained frequently but usually in late evening and accompanied by spectacular lightning. Mosquitoes are in evidence and, despite a wall plug device and sprays we were both bitten frequently. Guests attempting to leave the hotel by the main entrance have to run the gauntlet of a persistent group of motorised tricycle (Tuk Tuk) taxi drivers who will resort to any device to have you hire them. In addition, the driver will insist on waiting for you and interfere with your activities. Their constant attentions became oppressive, more so than had we stayed in Bentota or Hikkaduwa where there are more hotels, more activities, thereby more tourists to go around. Beach vendors were a nuisance but were not permitted onto hotel premises. A fellow female guests was accosted on the beach some 200yds from the hotel and robbed of her hat and wrap. This was however an isolated incident and we found the local people welcoming and keen to promote their countries new found stability. Expeditions were possible, 400 yards North along the beach to a fish restaurant shack is worthwhile. I ordered Lobster and drank a local beer whist two young men went out with snorkels and a net to retrieve one. 800yds south along the Galle road, on the left, is the Lucky Lanka Spice Garden and Ayurvidic Centre run by a charming young man. Full body massage for £10 and a large selection of herbal potions to buy at ‘local’ prices. Other worthwhile excursions are a tour of lagoon at Balapitaya (or Bentota) with a visit to one island to see cinnamon being hand rolled by a wonderful old man and his elfin grand daughter. A morning’s snorkelling by Some at International Dive Centre, located at Coral Sands Hotel in Hikkaduwa is good value where there is an excellent parade of fish, including Octopus. The coral was badly damaged in the Tsunami but hopefully showing signs of a return. If Temples and/or elephants are your thing, then there are further trips afield, e.g Kandy, Yala National Park and Burwela Bird Sanctuary. However, from Ahungalla, both entail an expenditure of over £110 pp, an overnight stay and between 5-7 hours in a minivan, each way. In summary; great hotel but we chose the wrong location for the type of holiday we enjoy. To get the best from Sri Lanka we would recommend dividing time between the Highlands, forests, wildlife parks and beaches. If however, you want a hotel based beach stay for a few days, you would be pushed to find better. Sri Lanka has great potential, stunning scenery, culture, a vibrant history and the most glorious beaches I have seen.",neutral
"We stayed for two weeks at the end of September after the hotel was highly recommended to us by a friend. From the moment we arrived we were treated to a true five star experience. Our room was a deluxe room overlooking the Green Pool with a view of the sea and we couldn't have asked for better. The bathroom had double sinks and the bed was better than our one at home. The buffet food was always fresh and inspiring and the chefs would always cook some plain chicken for my fussy 6 year old daughter. The restaurant staff, even when really busy, were always smiling and attentive. We were especially impressed by KK (Kumara) who went out of his way to make our family holiday incredible. He is a credit to the hotel as well as his colleague Thusara, who also looked after us. The bar staff were great, as were the canapés served with our delicious arrack. The pools were lovely to swim in, especially the Green Pool. We would thoroughly recommend this hotel, even though it's large it has the personal feel of a smaller hotel. It's also worth mentioning that we booked the hotel with Imthiyaz at Sun City Travels in Colombo and he got us a very good rate for our stay. We would like to thank all the staff for their fantastic efforts in making our holiday so amazing. My daughter says she would give the hotel 10 stars if she was allowed. We look forward to returning in 2014. Hector, Maria and Kandy Baker.",neutral

People dont like to stay like that. My bithroom comed not enough pressure to flush need to do 5 times to flush it. Please fix it. Because you change the people. Give them a good service. This is rhe 2nd time i came to stay.. Thanks.",negative
"We booked a double room and from the time of our arrival it felt like we were in a quarantine facility. For a beach hotel that should exude a relaxed vibe, the entire entry was roped off!! We were taken over by a hostess from the time of arrival and directed like school children - ""stay here, do that, etc"". Walked through an xray scanner which is quite okay but which was the only entry. Ordered to sit down, ordered to wear masks etc. It is a really open space and we are all triple vaccinated. The elevators were not working. The room was good but was definitely overrun with moisture issues. ""Double"" meant two single beds pushed together!! Tried to order a cocktail in the bar but was told that because of ""supply issues"" only Arrack cocktails were available. Had dinner in the coffee shop and were served french fries cooked in rancid Coconut Oil!! When asked why, was told ""supply issues"". I was offered a replacement but wondered how was I going to receive a replacement if there was indeed a supply issue?? Was a victim of overt racism at breakfast. As a Sri Lankan, I was singled out and ordered to wear a mask!! At a buffet!! All the other non Sri Lankan guests were exempted including my partner. I did complain to the restaurant manager who was very receptive and apologetic. Tried walking on the beach - impossible. All the vendors and touts just follow you around and obviously there is no control from the hotel. Overall a disappointing experience",negative

"This mu first visit of down south hotels vacation but the second time of Aitken Spence hotels. (i stay at Hiltop)Seems the hotel location fantastic and environment was good. Reception was not very good as we had to wait more at the the front on my vehicle because less of your drivers which is cause a vehicle ques. Reception ladies good and they are pleasant to visitors. Swimming pool good but they are not providing mat and swimming towels when we went there. I inquired but the workers not provided specially for locals seems they are more focusing on foreigners. Food - Not quite goods/taste may be your staff forcussing on foreigners. Direction not clear - Restaurants, Spa Rooms, Gym etc. Not path direction given when coming out form rooms. Rooms - I stayed Deluxe room seems the private balcony was dirty, chairs, table and chair mats not cleaned. Water bottle provided for room are not enough because they are small ones. Restaurant Service also not quite goods as we have to move our palates beside to have next meal according to your course menu. They more focusing on foreigners not locals. Spa- Need brief introduction of Spa and massage, i was planned to have but due lack information i gave up. Better have induction for locals how, when, where, who is doing.(develop a interest) Finally when i am seen the hotels through the web thought it will be fantastic one but it was not there when i came in. my aim to develop you all to serve better in future not to make complain against you all. Have a great businesses.",neutral

"we chose this hotel for 5 days rest on our arrival in Sri Lanka. Whilst the hotel itself is lovely and our room was fantastic - clean, large, great balcony, lovely big clean bathroom - we were disappointed by the aggressive sales tactics of the staff every time we were in the main hotel area. We were constanly being asked if we wanted to try the spa, the fine dining restaurant or the outrageously expensive barbecue on the beach. We found the hotel bar and restaurant to be very over priced as well. This is definitely more of a family hotel so those without children may consider other options. There is a limited amount to do outside the hotel so may be better for people on an all inclusive or at least half board package. We did appreciate the hotel's facilities - two lovely clean pools, tennis courts, table tennis all available but the beach isn't really very usable due to the number of salesmen on it (not the hote's fault).",neutral
Food was excellent ( catering to different palates ),positive
"I have stayed at the hotel a number of times, but this was the first time in approx 13 years. The hotel is looking a bit tired and needs more money/investment. Whilst the staff are generally good and try, the quality of the staff is not as good as it used to be, which does affect the experience. I tried to extend my stay by a night at the reception desk, to be told I needed to do this via Booking.com. The price I paid was cheaper than the price I had paid via the hotel's website.",neutral

"The hotel is a beautiful Bawa designed property with an impressive lobby that overlooks and infinitely pool that goes out to the edge of the beach with the ocean just beyond. The rooms are large and well maintained. But the food was really below average and the service bordered on the indifferent. The dining hall staff were really quite awful and looked and behaved like they hated their job. Tables not cleared, no one coming to check on you etc. Very disappointing on that end.

"The Triton has been renovated and relaunched at the Heritance Ahungalla (May 2006). Under the management of Aitken Spence, a major Sri Lanken hotel group, they have attempted to move away from their previous 'all inclusive' package approach to become 'Sri Lanka's first 6 star hotel'. To be honest, they have a long way to go to achieve this level. We visited in June, very shortly after they reopened. In fact, building work wasn't completed and the new Spa will not be on line for 6 months or more. It is a bit hard to know how to be fair to this hotel. They've done a great job renovating the public areas of the hotel. Although only one bar & the coffee shop were open when we were there they were very attractive, with attentive service and good (but not outstanding) food. There was also a small libary, well stocked with books for beach reading. However the biggest drawback is the size of the bedrooms. In comparison to other Sri Lankan top end hotels - such as the Galle Lighthouse Hotel or Dambulla Kandalama - the rooms and bathrooms (no bath provided) are very small. Although nicely decorated they lack a feeling of space and light. Plus the layout of the hotel means that many rooms look (indirectly) into other rooms. Staff vary from excellent (thoughtful and friendly) to down right annoying in their continual expectation of tips. The better staff including the restaurant staff were good, but lifeguards and one room boy were very pushy. Plus the internet access is ridiculously expensive ($US15 hour - over 4 times higher than anywhere else we stayed). The beach is long and undeveloped. The two pools are spacious, with plenty of deckchairs (however there were only 15 - 30 people there at the time). All in all a reasonalbly good hotel, but they have some way to go to meet the standards they have set for themselves. I was a bit disappointed and would, if I had my time again, had chosen to stay in longer Galle in preference to moving along the coast.",neutral

Fabulous Stay With 5 Star +++ Service,positive
"We stayed one night (full board) in a Premium room. The entrance to the hotel was impressive. We were very satisfied with the detailed security check that was done on arrival considering the prevailing situation in the country. The welcome was warm and friendly. Our room was comfortable. The restaurant was ok and food was good. The restaurant manager was very friendly. The hotel has two pools, thus making the pools less crowded at a given time, despite the number of guests. The beach was spectacular! It was a gloomy evening and we walked about 10 minutes to the North (as recommended by hotel staff) and came upon some cliffs that gave the most spectacular views of the ocean! Since we checked in on a week day, we were able to relax and spend a peaceful day. I heard it gets busier during weekends.",positive

It's a good thing that each person gets a different username & password for the wifi because it's now easier and faster to use. Thank you for your great hospitality.",positive
"Was working in Sri Lanka and had the weekend to myself and managed to get a very good rate last minute for a very reasonable price (same as a HIE in uk) however full rate I think would be maybe not so worth it. Please note when I arrived they were doing quite a bit of rennovations (though this was being done discreetly and quietly to minimise effect to guests). However hotel was probably at least 50% empty. Hotel is a Geofrey Bawa Hotel (famous architect) and you can see his style throughout the hotel. Its not the usually glassy inpersonal type hotel that you can sometimes stay in - this hotel does have character for a large hotel. Though I think the hotel could do more to enhance this. Its quite a Large hotel with reasonable facilities. I went for a wander when I first arrived and everytime I turned a corner I seemed to find something new whether it was table tennis, to the table courts to a bars that are nicely spread out. Hotel itself is in lovely bay with some wonderful views. Overall I think it was a lovely stay however not quite as special as I thought it would be from hotel website. LOCATION Its roughtly 1.5 hours drive from Colombo, and probably a good 3 hours drive from airport. If you are suffering after a travelling you maybe want to do a stop over in Negombo near airport or Colombo city. Its slightly away from many of the overcrowded toursit areas like Bentota and this can have good and bad points. ARRIVAL When you arrive at the hotel - you are ushered to sit down and they bring over some refreshments whilst you sign in. It was nicely done - though I think if busy this may take some time, this si kind of usual for Sri lanka so be prepared for this and I take the time to wander a little or orders ome drinks. ROOM Room was well furnished and decorated - I had view of the back Pool and beach. Full AC and Fan. Please note room leads to an open plan corridor (very Geffrey Bawa - but this does mean at night you may get a few mosi's in your room when you open door or use the balacony so get them to spray your room before you go to bed and use the fan(mosi cant land on you if you have fan on) - I carry a can of baygon which you can buy in local shops to kill any mosi that may be hiding at night. Toilet was nicely done - though please note - no bath - which if you have children you may want to check on which rooms have baths. The toiletries were fine - but nothing to write home about - personally I prefer my own. Hairdryer in bathroom was good enough for ladies use. All seemed very clean and nice Wardrobe and draws, and space above draws doubles as suitcase stand. Beds were very comfortable, and sheets and towels all seemed fine and I had no complaints compared to other reviewers. Room had safe in wardrobe which seemed usual good hotel quality. There was a console desk for laptop and stuff. Kettle coffee/tea facilities. There was a very small mini frdge but it had no icebox which is a shame. Also please note alcohol apart from local beer is expensive - I would purchase what you need at duty free. Also in room large media cabinet - I am hoping they will look into flatscreens tv soon! Usual Sri Lankan Satellite available. I would have liked a DVD player. Also is small sofa and coffee table. Room had good lighting and I loved instaed of heavy curtains. they have light muslin nets curtain and then huge sliding panels which makes the room very dark and peaceful. The windows seemed to insulate reasonable well against outside although to be fair it was very quiet in any case. The balcony was usual standard - 2 seats and table. They gave free wifi FACILITIES Not bad for Sri Lankan hotel, but not quite up to a top western hotel. 2 very lovely pools, one with jacuzzi. tennis court (not sure whether in good state), table tennis, fitness room (nobody uses), pool/snooker tables (you pay for this about $1.5) 3 restaurants and quite a few bars, there is a games room and library however I never bothered to check this out. However no shops (its shutdown) jsut a jewerally shop. To get to anywhere you need to take a short drive. There is very lovely Spa with Indonesian ladies brought in specially - my advice - check this out - its lovely! FOOD I never bothered with restaurants - prefering to get room service. My first order a salad was so dissappointing - I had 1 lettuce leaf - I kid you not. However I peservered and everything else that came was lovely, and they even brought me cocktails and extra's to the room. However for half board price its probably better value to just eat the buffet on offer. I did do breakfast and was a good Sri Lankan buffet with plenty of variety from European, German, English, French to Sri Lankan curries. BEACH Beach is lovely - pretty clean when I went and is a very long bay. No packs of dogs and all very pretty. However annoying youths spoiled my walk by myself but the other locals when they heard were so horrified by rude behavious and apologised - which was very sweet. they even offered to accompany me at a distance so I could enjoy my walk without being bothered. SPA Well worth a visit on 1st day to help you get into holiday spirit of relaxation. Not Sri Lankan cheap but reasonable price by western prices. SERVICE It was quiet, however I thought service was very good. nicely balanced although I can see how some reviewers may get annoyed with the overfriendliness of some staff. Bless them they are on the whole very eager to make sure you enjoy yourself and you stay is good. I would rather have this than the rude obnoxious service you can get in the UK. Other points - Ground floor rooms - balcony is open to the grounds. Its perfectly safe - but with very young children this may be either a blessing or an issue. Also the ground floor rooms near the back swimming pool - may get noisy. If this is an issue I would mention it when you book or email hotel before your arrival. BOOKING OUT The bane of all Sri Lankan Hotels and this one is no exception - allow 20 mins at least to book out if its not busy and a lot longer if it is busy. I would suggest get them to organise bill whilst you finish packing up or having breakfast. OVERALL A really lovely hotel but perhaps not quite up to the image suggested on the glossy website (but maybe after rennovations??). However I actually preferred this to the Lighthouse near galle (another Geofrey Bawa hotel) due to service and has a certain something to it. Location is lovely and tranquil when I visited. Would I go back - most definately however 3-4 days would be my limit. Just not enough there yet.",neutral

"Just came back from two weeks in HA. This is a lovely hotel and we cannot add too much to the previous positive reviews but just would like to share some of the points that we think worth to be mentioned. Location. This is the most important thing that needs to be considered if you plan to choose this hotel. The thing is that it is unexpectedly isolated. Most of the beach side hotels in Sri Lanka (especially such big as HA) have a developed touristic infrastructure just outside their entrance doors - shops, travel agencies, restaurants, etc. HA is not the case. Here you can find only two restaurants on the beach and … that’s all. Needless to say that the prices for everything (from taxi to excursions) are the same or just a bit less than in the hotel. Just as an example we found out that ordering a room service dinner is cheaper than going to the restaurants. So, be prepared. At the same time the good point is that the Beach is just perfect. Because the hotel is so isolated the whole huge shore line is used only by the guests. This is the advantage that cannot be underestimated. Rooms Rooms are Ok. Not bad but nothing special. We were staying in the luxury room on the second floor. All floors have all types of rooms, but the third floor is considered ‘special’ and costs some extra money. We asked for relocation to the third floor but were explained that we needed to pay a difference. As it was written in the other reviews only the third floor had a full sea view. The second and first have it only partial. This does not mean that the view is bad – no, you’ll be overlooking the big (really big) and nice (really nice) pool or picturesque garden with monkeys and varans . Position HA stands rather far away from the main touristic attractions of the central and southern Sri Lanka. If you want to see something you should expect to get up at 5 or 3 a.m. to spend a whole day in the car. The trip from the airport takes around 2.5-4 hours. When you negotiate with taxi it is advisable to make it clear from the very beginning that the price include highway fee. If you do not choose highway be ready to spend 4 hours in the permanent traffic jam on the local road. Conclusion Would I recommend this hotel? Yes, why not. It is well maintained, stylish and relaxing. If you like the beach relaxation, travel with a kid or just want to have a break after exploring the island HA might be a good option. Would I come back? No, next time we’d rather choose some of the hotels on the south closer to Galle.",positive
"We spent three days at this beautiful hotel which is situated on a sandy quiet beach. The pool, the food and the general cleaniliness of the hotel cannot be faulted. The staff were exceptional. They couldnt do enough for the guests. We had a wonderful restful holiday. Perhaps the two areas that could be improved are - a) the evening entertainment needs to be improved especially as there is nothing available outside the hotel. Something as simple as having a cinema room would help b) the wifi is very unrealiable, which can be frustrating. Overall, very happy with our time at the hotel. M.J",positive

Serving beverages with cracked cups/glasses which also have dead insects gluing to them. The food is not well prepared neither fresh, including the seafood!

"We stayed in this hotel as the relax part of our trip to Sri Lanka. We can said that the others heritance hotels we been were better. Because you are in a village, we probably will have all your meals at the hotel, we were disappointed about the quality and the variation of the food during dinner. The hotel is very large and they have to swimming pool areas, the northern one has less people.",neutral
"We have been traveling around south India and Sri Lanka for almost 1 month. This hotel is not the worst of the lot, but it missed only by one place. In general it looks an feels very tired and you don't have to look very hard to find the dirt, grime, dust, and sand, and that was just in our room and bathroom. The same goes for many other public areas. With the exception of a few staff members we got the same impression. Tired of dealing with tourists... The food was only OK compared to everywhere else we stayed. It's a beautiful location, but unfortunately a disappointing experience compared to almost every other resort or hotel we have stayed at on this trip. Can't reccomend.",negative

"I am writing this over a cup of coffee from the hotel. I have visited this hotel from the days it was triton and this officially concludes my 8th visit to this place (yes thats right !) And i am not joking ! Why so many times well two things always bring us back , one is the food and next is the service and fllexibilty. So this makes it my first visit for this year and believe or not i m due there in september as well. Over the years this hotel was able keep up as one of the trendiest in the vicinity however now it seems to lack behind. The food was once heavenly but now let me simply say "" not as heavenly"" . We were always amazed by the weekend dinner barbecue but this time it was highly dissapointimg and disorganised. We always loved the jumbo prawns and lobster (cray fish) that they always did have . but this time the stock seemed old and frozen . Worst of all the buffet spread never seemed to be re filled . Todays breakfast , i had to tell more than 3 jr chefs to re fill the bacon and it took them 20 mins. So yeah alot of negatives seemed to be observed by our group of friends who have just like me been patriots of this establishement. Rooms seemed to have changed very little. Some rooms seemed to be well stock with all the essentials some rooms seemed to lack a few things e.g bottle openers tea /cofee refills and glasses . However for a person visiting for the first time this perception can definitely differ . This was written with a lot of dissapointment and heart break hope the management will be able to revive this place before it becomes uncontrollable ( not that it is bad ) . Ps one thing that has never ever changed is the friendly staff so kudos for that. Love how pleasant everybody is ! C u soon as always :)",negative

"It's what you don't see in the glossy photos and marketing blurb, but step one metre outside the hotel grounds (front/roadside or back/beachside) and you'll immediately be surrounded by local touts, who draw you into conversation with general chit-chat (Where are you from? How long are you staying?) before swiftly moving on to the HARD SELL (for tours, tuktuks, souvenirs, restaurants, etc), or muscling in on trying to carry your shopping and gathering around when you get your change in the hope of receiving some cash. In short, it doesn't make you feel like a human being; more like a walking Rupee or Dollar bill waiting to get rinsed. I am expecting the mandatory response from the hotel manager (does he really write these Trip Advisor responses?!), saying the hotel is working with the touts to improve the experience for guests... if this is true (and it seems to have been ongoing for some time), it simply is not working. A cynic would suggest the touts benefit the hotel in scaring guests into only using the hotel's services. We did this initially - a 9km taxi trip was a set hotel price of $27 return, compared to £2.50 single in a tuktuk. And the hotel taxi driver was hell-bent on taking us to a turtle hatchery, temple, Ayurveda centre, tea shop, etc. instead of where we had actually asked to go, which was exasperating. As for the hotel itself, one you get beyond the wow factor of the pools, the hotel rooms are comfortable and functional, serviced by attentive housekeeping staff. The buffet restaurant is acceptable as a day-to-day dining option and the communal areas are decently maintained. But will we be recommending the hotel or visiting it again? Sadly, the persistent pestering and hassle we encountered from the locals means the response is a resounding 'NO'.",negative

バワ建築好きなので、ゆっくりしたいと3泊しました。部屋も素敵だったし、ご飯も美味しかったし、ビーチも目の前で、滞在自体は満足のいくものでした。 しかし、それを台無しにする残念なことがありました。 １つは、滞在が週末だったため、とにかくうるさかった事。隣の部屋では、若い男女が10人以上で、爆音の音楽かけたり、バルコニーで騒いだりしていて、注意してもらってもまた騒ぐという感じでした。プールも若者のグループや家族連れで騒がしいので、ゆっくり過ごしたい人は、週末は避けた方がいいと思います。 あと、支払を現地払いにしていたのですが、チェックイン時に請求された金額と、Agodaで予約した時の金額が異なったので、チェックアウト時に確認したのですが、係りの人は「間違いありません」の一点張りでした。急いでいたのもあり、あとはAgodaに間に入ってもらって、話をしてもらいますと伝えて、ホテルを出ようとしたら、他のスタッフが調べるので時間をくれと言って来ました。結局、ホテル側のミスであることが判明しましたが、予約管理も出来てないのかな？と、気分が悪いままホテルを後にしました。 現地払いのプランで予約する場合、支払時に確認を忘れないようにして下さい。,negative
"As you enter, the view of the beautiful pool .... merging into a pristine beach ... merging into the sea sweeps you away. Unfortunately you don't get swept off your feet at this property. Since we didn't get a booking at the VIVANTA by Taj in Bentota we thought we'd try the Heritance. The property is run down and seems to have seen better days. A renovation should be on the cards sooner than later. We were upgraded to a suite named after the legendary Sachin Tendulkar but unfortunately the exhilaration of of the room or the hotel in no way matched the Little Master's batting. The room was ill-planned. No light switches and plug points in the right places, basins in which you couldn't splash your face, a Mini Bar fridge with a broken shelf, and never replenished, pathetic mal-functioning wifi...... and one could go on and on.... Minor glitches but collectively a huge nuisance for the price we paid. The biggest problem was the air-conditioning, never below 24 degrees Celsius. This in a hot and humid Bentota was a big problem. Two large swimming pools. Wow !! one for playing and kids and one for peaceful and serious swimmers like me. A Great idea! However the pleasure was short lived when we entered the pool. The water was cloudy and had particles flowing in it. Temperature was like soup. The Gym was exceedingly ill-equipped for the number of rooms. Only two treadmills, one of which was closed non-functional for the duration of my stay. One large dining area for buffets. One fine-dining restaurant but we never saw a living sole there in the 4 nights we spent. The food at the buffets were exceptional, but in case you're a vegetarian please be very careful. Options are very limited. Since large groups were coming in the buffet tables had huge queues. I for one am fond of nibbling tit bits going often to the table. But that was a Big no-no. Dealing with the lower staff is impossible. Not only is their a pathetic standard of English, many of them pretend to understand and say yes but things are not done. However I'd be failing in my duty if I didn't mention here, that the senior staff ably led by GM Mr Upul Peiris and the F&B Manager Gamini, were extremely courteous and helpful. Highly responsive. Problems brought to their notice were promptly attended to. I believe Mr Peiris has been here only for a few months. Seeing his leadership abilities and genuine concern for the customer I'm very sure these glitches should be a thing of the past very soon. The management needs to move from Responsiveness to Pro-activeness. My recommendation is to go here at a quiet time and not during peak season.",negative

"A Geoffrey Bawa hotel on the coast of Sri Lanka. There are some real highlights: smooth, cool design, excellent swimming pool, fantastic location next to the beach. And some lows: the horrible smoke-filled restaurant (we had to ask for Sri Lankan dishes: they aren't always offered), irritating piped music, dodgy evening karaoke-style entertainer (though, to be fair, some guests seemed to enjoy it), and inadequate wi-fi. I would liked to have given this hotel 3.5 stars, since it is better than ""average"", but that doesn't seem to be available.",neutral

"Heritance Ahungalla is a decent hotel with excellent staff. Stayed three nights with family and friends and the staff were always obliging and eager to please. They also work hard. The hotel was busy and it covers a big area and the staff were as busy as bees. But always good to the guests. Where I mark the hotel down is: a) The hotel is dated and looking very tired. I think one wing looked recently renovated, but the wing we stayed in, although clean, looked too tired. It badly needs an upgrade. A '5 star' should not be allowed to deteriorate to this extent before renovation b) It's a large hotel but surprisingly low on activities. As a result there is no 'wow' factor to justify the expensive rates. The beach is nice and it's a long stretch but the hotel is strangely lifeless and boring. As it is I would say this is a '4 star'. We had a nice time but there are so many options in Sri Lanka now and there isn't a good enough reason to return to this hotel.",neutral

"Arrived late following delayed flight and driver getting lost so we weren't in the best of moods. Felt we could have been offered some food instead of relying on the mini bar but I suppose we could have asked for it. Shown to a room which had a view of a tree right outside so changed that to a much better one overlooking the pool with a sea view. Much better but why are the bathrooms left with bare plaster? Don't get that one. The good times then began because Heritance is a wonderful hotel with excellent staff in a glorious position on a beautiful beach. Felt like Robinson Crusoe whenever I walked on it with waving palms behind me and my feet in the warm Indian Ocean. Only problem are the beach kawkers who don't take no for an answer and pester you to death. The big pool is awesome and the pool attendants outstanding at providing towels and mattresses very quickly. Food is a bit hit and miss. Breakfast is really good if you go in early; not so good if you go in late and food has not been re- refreshed. The evening buffet was exceptional on barbecue night but a little bland on other nights although there was always something to attract you. Desserts are very good as are the soups. Tried the a la carte restaurant once and the lobster was really good but took an eternity to come -odd with only two of us in there but great value for money. The hotel is made for relaxing and the staff go out of their way to help guests to enjoy their stay. We only had four days and we were really sorry to leave. When the sun is out and you're on your sunbed by the pool overlooking the beach, it just doesn't get any better! Will come again for a longer stay.",neutral

We were asked to go to the coffee shop, over there we were told they would prepare something veg and would take 45 minutes. But what we were served was inedible even our dog back home wouldn't eat it. Over all the hotel was great but we had a bad time with food. The breakfast was good.

"So disappointed with our return visit to this hotel. 5 star this is not,! Food was disappointing and variety poor. Stale bread rolls at lunch/dinner which were obviously left over from breakfast. We weren't told that alternative food was available & only found this out on the day we left !!!! The rooms were obviously designed by a man as they were not women friendly. Main lights in the bedroom were 3 downlights, really how are we supposed to do hair & make up??? Sink in the bathroom was too high we are not all tall. Plain glass in the bathroom with blinds that were obviously an after thought. We will not be returning a 3rd time. Al so no evening entertainment that we know of",negative
"We've just returned from our honeymoon - a week in the Maldives(paradise) followed by a week in Sri Lanka staying in the Heritance Ahungalla. The hotel is beautiful just like any hotel in a major city let it be London, Dublin or New York so if its traditional Sri Lankan style your looking for than its not for you. Our room was looking out onto the ocean however the water was unfortunately too rough for swimming. There wasn't a soul on the beach for the entire duration of our trip apart from the usual hawkers who camp out on the beach for the day in the hope of selling the odd sarong or two. The food was nice but became extremely repetitive when your there for 6 days, bearing in mind there's nothing outside the hotel so no chance of eating anywhere else. If you like a drink and a bit of a buzz at nite then this is also not the hotel for you, the bars have no atmosphere.Your not encouraged to go out of the hotel however saying that there's nothing to go out for in the line of entertainment, shopping or eating just a little shop across the road which sells water and snacks which may come in handy as hotels prices are the same if not even more expenive than home. Once you walk out of the hotel you'll be surrounded by hawkers trying to sell you tours which can be annoying as they're fairly persistent. We went on a local tour by tuk tuk with Raji who camps out outside the hotel or beach, his English is perfect which helps. This was quite enjoyable apart from being brought to two different shops trying to get us to buy stuff, this is standard procedure if u take a tuk tuk anyway. We did the nearby river safari which we booked through our travel rep. This would be very managable and much cheaper to do by travelling by tuk tuk and hopping on a boat when you get there, just a few mins down the road. We also went to a national park spotting elephants, about 9 hrs in a car but enjoyable all the same.All of the staff in the hotel were outstanding very friendly and pleasant. Sri Lanka is really just a country for touring around, the ideal would be 4 or 5 days seeing the sights staying in a different hotel ever nite. As part of a tour I would defintely recommend a nite or two in this hotel but def no longer.",negative

What a lovely day out at the Bachuus bar I first of all love this hotel because of the architecture... One of the well known Sri Lankan architects Geoffrey bawa is the one who built this magnificent hotel. I love the staff here they are so friendly and the service is so excellent and the food here is so delicious. I will definitely visit this hotel again,positive
"Ok so after arriving from a long 11/12 Hour flight from UK the 3 hour transfer to the hotel was not an experience I was looking forward to the traffic was very bad and seemed to take a life time. We had our own private car transfer and I would advise anyone staying to do the same to make the journey more bareable. Upon arrival it was evident the journey had been well worth it the architecture and landscape is truely breath taking. We recieved a warm friendly welcome and was wisked off to the bar for a welcome drink while our luggage was taken to our room. We were shown to our room and the staff member talked us through how to use the air con and the facilities available. As soon as the staff member left my partner and I burst out laughing as we couldn't believe how lucky we were. The room was amazing with stunning Ocean views and the main infinity pool from our balcony. The room is finished to a very high standard, immaculatley clean. Well stocked mini bar (not complimentary), fridge, air con and cieling fan, safe, plenty of storage for clothes, TV, Phone, complimentary water (replenished daily) and a welcome cake. The bathroom had ample towels which were changed twice daily (bare this in mind if you like us to have a nap in the early eve before dinner to put you do not disturb sign on the door so they dont disturb you while your sleeping) complimentary toiletries -shampoo, shower gel and body lotion. Our room had a huge rain shower (room for 2 or even 3 people hehe) I noted there was also a hair dryer but can't say either of us used it. Food-Breakfast was the biggest breakfast buffet I have ever seen it was nice to be able to to sample a Sri Lankan breakfast but no fear if thats not your thing there is much more a wide range of breads, cakes and pasteries, cold meats, cheese, salad, everything for a cooked English breakfast and chefs cooking omelettes, waffles, pancakes and fresh fruit/juice theatre style. (we never felt the need to eat lunch after that lot) We ate dinner in the Mustard Coffee shop on the first night the Lobster was very nice! We had dinner in the main Jute retaurant restaurant for the rest of our stay which was a set menu most evenings about 7 courses, canape, 3 starters usually small bite size of each (served at same time) 2 soups (small cups served at same time) a sorbet then you had a choice of mains which was usually a meat dish a fish/seafood dish and vegetarian option you then had a choice of desserts followed by fresh Ceylon tea or coffee they also had 2 BBQ themed evenings during our stay spoilt for choice for meats and fresh seafoods salads and desserts other hot non BBQ dishes were also available on the buffet such as currys and pasta dishes the cost was 2500 rupees (per person for both the set dinner and BBQ roughly £13) which we thought was really good value. The food was always excecuted and presented extremley well although maybe one or two too many components on a plate at the same time (but this is probably my chefy foodie head on) each component tasted great and thats what matters. Drinks- we stuck to drinking the local 'lion' beer for most of our trip (served with a glass that had been stored in the freezer to ensure its stayes nice and cold which was a nice touch) which was 320 rupees (£1.70 a pint size bottle) we was shown an extensive wine list that had lots of famliar names I think the cheapest started around £12. We drunk our way through the cocktail menu on the last night all very nice particularly their own Heritance cocktail (cant remember exact name i had hade a few by then) made with the local Arak and all the classics are also available all 800 rupees (roughly £4.50) we was treated to complimentary canapes and homemade crisps as we enjoyed our drinks service at the bar and restaurant was always great. Facilities - 2 Huge Infinity pools we was lucky the hotel was not busy the only people in them most days the pool attendents were very friendly and sufficent, i noted a tennis court, volly ball net, snooker room, games room although didn't use them so not sure if they have the equipment or you need to bring your own? There internet access in the Library on the second floor it was just over £1 for an hour you have to get a card from the reception. Theres a night club on site we popped in briefly but as the hotel was quiet we was the only people in there and wasn't quite the same raving on ya own haha. Music from the club was well contained so not fear of being woken up by music in your room. There is a Spa but was a bit to pricey for us. There is a well equiped gym that is free to guests. We took a tuk tuk (300 rupees roughly £1.60 return) down the road to the turtle hatchery 1000 rupees PP entrance donation (£5.50) we went around 3pm we was advised the best time to go is around 5/6pm you might then be able to takes some turtles back to the sea (we didnt want wait around that long) still an enjoyable experience either way. The weather was perfect (June 4th-12th 2009) cloudy most days but hot (hot enough to get a tan or burnt in my case) with a nice sea breeze the odd down pour usually in the afternoon but it stops and dry out again real quick didnt bother us at all the sea unfortunately was to rough for a propper swim but was ok for a paddle my partner also go a mild sting from a jelly fish so that put us off going in again. As other people have said in their reviews hawkers (lookie lookie men/woman) are a real hassel on the beach and surrounding area we walked to the local shop to try and buy Cigarettes (you cant bring any in duty free without paying goverment tax) and we were swamped with people trying to talk to us takes us places make us go to shops following us it was a bit overwhelming and i didn't feel particularly safe having so many people around me we didnt leave the hotel on foot again after that. Also many a quiet morning walk on the beach would be spoilt I saw one couple get surrounded by 8 people this is something the resort have no control other however they do have security guards on the beach preventing them entering so no hassel in the resort complex. So an amazing stay! Definatley want to go back.",neutral

"Just got back from the Heritance and had a marvellous time there.It is beautifully designed,with two infinity pools leading your eye out to the sea.Our room had a great sea view and was very well furnished.Beds were comfy and the bathroom was great-I want a wet room like theirs!!!Premiership matches on the box and two english speaking movie channels. The food was very good and i found myself eating curry three times a day!!i also brought a hopper pan back with me to have egg-hoppers for beakfast.However we were a little disappointed with the fine dining restaurant.The prices are the same as back home, and they had very pretty food on the plate, but it needs Gordon Ramsey to go in and make it less fussy and more tasty.With such good seafood(the tuna is the best!) i would have liked to have seen a japanese restaurant or something similar.The 'mustard' coffe shop was more to our liking-less pretentious and good food,and of course you can always find something nice in the buffet restaurant. Service is very good,if a little too much! Sri Lanka is a paradise for wildlife and the hotel has in it's grounds; egrets,bee-eaters,squirrels,a small monitor lizard,gecko's and on an evening a large bat which we named 'Nora' (Batty!) which swooped around the pool bar while we were sipping pre dinner Martini's! We went on a river cruise through the mangroves which was excellent and a trip to Sinharaja Rainforest ,which is a must for bird watchers.Our driver Erish was the best.He took us around the village he grew up in and to meet some of his family,and releasing baby turtles into the sea at Kosgoda was very satisfying. Don't let tales of war in the north put you off going,you are not affected in the least.Soldiers with guns are at a lot of check points near Colombo,but there are thousands of Tamils and Sinhalese living in perfect harmony,it is lot more safe than Northern Ireland ever was.Just keep away from the north and north east to be on the safe side. They have recovered physically very well from the Tsunami,but anyone you talk to has lost loved ones(60,000 people)There won't be another one for hundreds of years,so don't let that put you off either! The Hotel is excellent and Sri Lanka is a lush,wildlife filled paradise,with sun and picture postcard beaches.It reminded me of a cross between Thailand(with Buddhist temples all over) and the nicer parts of south goa,give it a try.We'll definitely go back.",neutral
What lovely people the Sri Lankan people are. And the stuff here were continually ensuring that we enjoyed our stay. knowing that i was ill before arriving they continually made certain i was getting better. I would particularly like to thank Duminda from the restaurant. every time we saw Duminda he would smile and ask how we were and what we had done that day or what we were doing for the day. Nothing was ever a problem and every request was met with a smile. Duminda is certainly an asset to Heritance Ahungalla. we will certainly be returning Thank you Duminda.

The Best of 'Down South',positive
"I visited Heritance Ahungalla first time 16 years ago and again 15 years ago (when it was still operated under the name Triton), so I was very excited to go back to the hotel to see if it still carried that adventurous atmosphere that it did 16 years ago. I was also vevry excited to see how they had renovated the hotel after the horrible tsunami that destroyed much of the hotel about 10 years ago. I remembered the hotel as a luxurious hotel with a very high standard both in the restaurant and in the small bars around the area where you could buy from a large snack menu. Many of these places were closed now to my disappointment. The hotel of course more or less looked the same and the beautiful architecture of Geoffrey Bawa - Sri Lankas world renowned architect - was of course still stunning. I should say that my previous visits was during the peak season in february where the weather on that part of the island is fantastic. This time I visited in october and we experienced several hours of heavy rain on several of the days we stayed there, and of course that adds to the experience and the atmosphere as they had to keep huge plastic curtains down at all times to keep the water from running into the reception area and the bar area. The hallways was flooded due to the heavy rain and the open design of the hotel so they had to keep staff constantly mopping up water and that was of course no fault of theirs. That's just how it is during this season. But something seemed changed. The hotel seemed to have lost that exclusivity that set it apart from other hotels in Ahugalla/Bentota region.15 years ago there were a wonderful atmosphere in the evenings with jazz band and dancing in the lounge next to the reception and pool area. This time around that was gone - much to our dismay. We also remembered that every afternoon there was a very nice complimentary afternoon tea with buttercake and scones that you could enjoy just next to the large pool but when we asked if they still had it noone even seemed to remember that they had it 15 years ago. We stayed in one of the huge suites with several rooms a seperate living room two bathrooms, a huge balcony overloooking the residents pool with a view of the ocean behind the row of palm trees along the coast line. I don't know if some of the changes to the design and decor was due to the tsunami 10 years ago (after I visited the last time), but I remembered the beautiful residents pool (the other pool that are closed to anyone but guests in the suites and rooms in the fine wing with ocean view, and it was originally made with the most beautiful dark blue tiles that made it one of the most beautiful pools I had ever seen. This time the tiles have been removed and the pool was just an ordinary pool with a normal lightblue surface on the sides and bottom and not made from tiles anymore, just like so many ordinary pools you see all over Sri Lanka. That was sad - I thought. I may have needed refurbishment or renovation but they should have stayed true to the original design with the beautiful dark blue tiles when repairing the pool instead of the cheaper solution, as this did something to make the place stand out in a way that it now doesn't anymore. They also had a wonderful original boat like the ones used by the original population in Sri Lanka that was a trademark of Triton (as it was once called) but they had done little to keep it maintained, so it had obviously deteriorated over the last decade so they hadn't saved it (unless of course it was taken by the tsunami ten years ago). To me it was just a little sad to se that on the patio where it was once standing proud in the middle of the large pool was now just an empty plate with nothing to decorate the otherwise elegant pool area around the public pool and bar area. Another thing that added to the impression they had lowered the standard since we last visited 15 years ago was the many families with screaming children running around the pool. 15 years ago there was a much more tranquil and serene atmosphere with adult guiests with a certain sense of etiquette, which includes preventing your children from running around the other quests at the pool and adressing strangers asking all sorts of questions instead of staying near their parents as they are supposed to when using the residents pool. What had since we last visited become a sad but necessary precaution was a several meters high fence between the hotel grounds and the beach where only a small opening heavily guarded by two guards at all times (day and night) was the only passage to the beach. In the old days one could just stroll down through the line of shady palm trees and reach the beach from anywhere along the hotel grounds. But it was obviously a necessary precaution as we could see that many more touts and beggars and people selling all sorts of ridiculous junk and overpriced sarons, were all over the beach. It even seemed to us as if some of these local hustlers had some corrupt arrangement with some of the guards as they sometimes happened to be inside the fence (which means they have passed the guards unattended), and even when guards saw them on hotel grounds contacting the guests, they did absolutely nothing or very little to stop them from intimidating the guests and/or even excort them from the grounds, which would of course be their duty. One of the nights I stood in the dark on my balcony outside our suite and I noticed a visibly drunk guard who could hardly wallk in a straight line talking a little with himself while he suddenly stopped near the tennis court and fumbled with his trouser until he mannaged to unzip his pants in the middle of the lawn and urinate. That latter I could even live with - I'm no prude - had he just walked behind a tree and taken care of business, but I didn't find the fact that he was visibly drunk very reassuring. The folloing nights I stayed for an hour on my balcony to see if the guard from the night before would return, would return, but much to my surprise I saw something very strange occur. One of the guards (not the same as the drunk guard from yesterday) suddenly turned on his torch and he waved it up and down and from side to sight while pointing it in the direction towards the edge of the hotel grounds. Shortly thereafter I saw two locals walking past the tennis courts and sitting just below my balcony between the building/wing and the tennis court. They couldn't see me as I kept the balcony lights off as well as the lights in the livingroom so I was hidden in the dark. I looked in astonishment as these very suspicious looking local people arrived and they opened small packages and presented them on the top of low walll surrounding the terrace belonging to the suite just below ours and the guards looked at the ""goods"" in the beam of their flashlight at what looked like small packages of either pot or very small portions of khat to me (I've only seen khat but nevver tried it so it could be something else, but I know that khat is very poular if you have a job where it's hard to stay awake and it's popular amongst lorry drivers etc. so I could imagine that a boring night shift would also tempt someone to use khat to keep from falling asleep as it is a mild energy booster that make that kan keep you awake and alert) and khat is actually not amongst forbidden substances in all countries (at least not in Europe), so the use of khat may even be legal in Sri Lanka, that I don't know. Well, that aside, the guards clearly counted and exchanged money for these ""goods"" in the dim light from their torch. Suddenly one of the guards heard me making a noise as I was taking a step back and he pointed the torch directly at my face and for a short while I was blinded, and they saw me on the balcony, so he turned off the torch and they exchanged a few hasty words with the locals who then wrapped up the rest of their goods and ran away along the tennis court and disappeared in the dark. This was in no way frightening or intimidating, but it just seemed like something that wouldn't have happened at the classy and stylish Triton of the old days, and it only contributed to the vague feeling that the standard of the hotel was not quite the same as it was 15 years ago. From the experiences above one would have thought that it was a horrible experience, so why do I give it four stars after all? Because they still provide many of the things they provided in the old days. We always live in large suites when we travel, so I have a large backlog of experiences to use as comparison, and I must say that the suite was wonderful. It was clean and beautifully furnished and the large balcony streched all the way around the suite and had access doors from all rooms in the suite. I will also like to give the place the benefit of the doubt, because many things were closed - and that might be because it is the low season in october, so my final judgment should not be made until I've tried the place again in the high season between medio january until medio march where the weather in the southwest part of the coast line of Sri Lanka has the most beautiful weather. We also dined at the a la carte restaurant (not the large dining hall, but Restaurant Mustard at the terrace on the left side of the reception area just after the reception desk around the corner). The food was delicious, the service was perfect, and the setting was cozy with a dimly lit area and a very romantic atmosphere. So taht was truly perfect. The in-room dining (room service) was also very good and arrived quickly. The breakfast was wonderful and came on time every morning exactly at the time we've put on the breakfast list to hang on the door before going to sleep. The staff couldn't do a better job. They were quick, courteous, smiling, polite and they didn't hover at any time or made certain trick to earn extra tips (such as coming two persons to a one man job, or staying in the room and keep asking if everything is to our satisfaction, etc. - you know the drill). But none from the staff we met did that at any time. Of course my wife and I both agree on giving a generous tip at no less than 20% of the bill every time something is served, so we allso made it easy for the staff not to hover, and that should perhaps be taken into consideration, but we also find that people in Sri Lanka live on extremely low wages, and compared to the prices in Denmark where we live, even an additional 20% still makes for a very cheap price for people living in Europe, Australia and North America, so i cost us so little but means so much to them, so there is no need to be a miserly cheapskate. If you can afford an expensive plane ticket and to stay in a somewhat pricey hotel like this you probably can also survive giving 500-1000 Rps ($3-$6 USD) more when tipping the waiter, room boy, luggage carriers, drivers, etc. It takes so little and being generous when tipping often comes back a thousand fold throughout your stay when you are being served by the grateful, hard working, staff at the hotel, trying to accomodate even your most extravagant wishes and habits.(That's just my personal opinion on this subject, and each to their own, of course). I believe all rooms are non-smoking but most rooms are with a balcony (or a terrace if at ground level) so this is a comfortable hotel for smokers.",negative
"The hotel lobby sets the scene for the hotel itself – a lobby spreading out into the infinity pool, that leads into the beach and sea. The staff provide a humbling and warm welcome, showcasing their hospitable nature from the moment you step inside. The pool is idyllic and the food showcases the talents of the award-winning kitchen. We were lucky to meet Celebrity Chef and 15 time Gold Olympic Medallist Dimuthu Kumarasinghe, and all I can say is that I am surprised he has not appeared on all our TV screens! A true culinary talent, and the most humble person, he has led an equally talent set of kitchen employees to create some truly wonderful culinary experiences. Thank you to Heshan and Kevin for giving us the best kitchen tour and pastry session, and Dinushan for providing a stellar hotel tour! All in all, this hotel is a must if you are visiting Ahungalla.",positive

"We stayed at this hotel for just one night on B&B basis. The room had a private balcony overlooking the pool and the sea. We ordered room service for both lunch and dinner. The food was good, delivery was quick and service was friendly and efficient. The breakfast buffet had a good spread with both international and Sri Lankan cuisine. The only complaint we had was that the A/C vent in the room was old and/or faulty as it made a rattling noise throughout the entire stay. We called maintenance and they came to take a look at it, but it couldn’t be rectified allegedly the hotel was full, so we didn’t have the option of moving to another room. Because of this, we didn’t sleep very well and our short stay was not as relaxing as we hoped.",neutral

"A short midweek trip with family and friends. Check in took a tad longer than expected. Booked a suit which was located centrally close to both pools and had a large sitting room separate from the bed room. it was excellent as we could have a get together with friends whilst the kids slept in. The spacious balcony opened out to a view of the hotel pools n garden, the golden sands and the westward sea. As it was a midweek day with less crowd, was not expecting much of a spread at the buffet, How wrong I was! It was less than on a weekend but still could hold its own with any hotel's weekend spread. Any foreign guest gets introduced to a good selection of Sri Lankan specialities, Italian pasta station to Indian Doses to Mongolian mixed rice action stations were all busily catering to individual requirements. The fruit selection at breakfast was amazing. The staff are friendly and helpful. Rooms were spotlessly clean. Pradeep the manager at the dinning hall was super! He was checking up on almost all the tables, assisting where ever needed. one of the lil kids at our table had a special request which was taken care of in a matter of minutes much to the amazement of our group. Had such a good time will be returning for sure!",positive
I went to this hotel after 15 years. It was our Annual Company Staff trip. Rooms were ample and well kept. Very comfortable bed and suiting lightings. Food was to be amazed not so good. Everything was lacking something and not the best food ever surprisingly. Service wasn't up to the standard. I had to wait more than ten minutes after requesting cutlery for dinner. And requesting hot water took more than ever. At breakfast I had to eat without a serviette because Steward never showed up. Sometimes I had to yell at them in order to get water. This type of service is never expected from a five star rated hotel. The night club was so much fun. The other terrible fact about the hotel was they switch off the lights in the corridors and we had to assist ourselves with a torch in order to find the room. Some of my friends had mistakenly tapped the wrong room. I mean this is a hotel which operates 24/7 and why do they wanna switch off the lights? Anyway I'm very disappointed with the service and food. I hope this will no longer continue. The best thing was the soothing beach view which was so relaxing. The two pools were breathtaking too.,negative
We stayed only one night in the hotel which was fully booked this day. The only option was to confirm a suite room. Price was ok since I am a resident and the room spacious and clean.

"This hotel, fronting the beach on a large plot of land, is popular judging from the number of guests when I was there. Some guests had been there more than 20 times over the years. However, I was rather disappointed to see that the hotel is rather run down, unclean from the dust on the floor, some walls looked as if unpainted, the toiletries in the bath-room were just shampoo, bath gel and body lotion topped up in small ceramic bottles which I dislike as they don’t appear to me to be hygienic. Further more, there were in-room slipper and thus makes walking in the room on unpleasant when wet after a shower. I said earlier, this is not a resort. Apart from the pool and restaurant, there were no other fun activities within the hotel for guests. But despite all these, I rather enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere surrounding the place and the friendly services of all staff. Our 3 nights stay there was thus an enjoyable one. As for location, there is no decent shopping nearby.",neutral

"A huge average tourist hotel. I would not call this place luxurious. Not sure if there are alternatives. If you can, skip this place. The beaches are not nice. Everything outside the hotel is depressing. They've had many years to fix, so there is no excuse for things looking so devastated and filthy after the Tsunami. Sorry, it's a real shame. The entire coast south and west looks terribly sad. I cannot in good conscience tell any of my friends to go there. There are so many poor people. Please give them employment and pay them to clean up the ENTIRE coast!",negative
"Pros: 1. Nice staff, ready to help in all matters (if you give them a tip, and they expect it). 2. Beautiful area with many animals (monkeys, palm squirrels, monkeys) 3. Nice pools Minuses: 1. All rooms located around the lobby are forced to listen to VERY loud music until 11-12 pm (our beds literally almost vibrated). We had to move further away because it was impossible to rest. 2. The choice of food only seems large, the spiciness is not indicated anywhere, so you had to take it at random. There is nothing at all for children. If you have stomach problems, you will have nothing to choose from. In fact, the only fruits were papaya, pineapple and unleavened watermelons. Sometimes I have bananas for breakfast. 3. The staff in the dining room is very slow - drinks were sometimes brought by the end of the meal 4. You should not take excursions from the guys on the beach - they will charge you twice as much and will try to take you to every place where they have a kickback. It's better to leave the hotel and negotiate with the tuk-tukers there. 5. To get to the ocean you need to break through a crowd of very intrusive locals who are trying to push everything on you - by the end of your vacation it’s already starting to irritate you. Not a minus of the hotel itself, but you won’t be able to swim in the ocean - the waves are quite shallow. No one has change, so count on it and change it for small money right away, otherwise you will also overpay.",neutral

Moerover, the staff by the poolside is terribly slow. Hotel common areas are dirty. Saw used diapers and used band aids by the pool! Took them forever to ask for food and drinks. They did not even have mint to make certain cocktails! Ran out apparently. I would rate this as a 3 star, and nothing more. Will not return. Diasppointed. Waste of money.",negative

"Totally disappointed with this hotel. The entrance foyer was cold and clinical which was about the standard for the whole hotel. There was no entertainment until we complained and then there was some water aerobics and that was about it. There was a games room that was filthy and had about 2 board games in it, the snooker table you had to pay for, the pool table you had to pay for. There were 3 restaurants but you only really had a choice of 2 as the Upper Dining Room was ridiculously expensive, we did not actually see anyone eat there in our 2 week stayy! There was a cafe with a very limited menu or the main restaurant that was a buffet. The food in these 2 restaurants was okay but the service was terrible. Breakfast was served in the buffet restaurant and the tables were always mucky, you had to constantly ask for tea or coffee and sometimes wait for up to 20 minutes for it to arrive. On a Saturday the hotel opens the main infinity pool area up to local customers, this meant that we had to use the other pool which upset the children. The main pool was rammed with people playing games and being extremely loud making it much to dangerous for children to swim and also a very uncomfortable environment. Whilst at the other pool we ordered lunch and were told we would have a long wait as they were so busy as it was a Saturday!! Whilst we were at the hotel the Sri Lankan and Indian national crickets teams were there, the hotels focus was totally on them and important members of staff were moved to run the catering at the matches - this was very much noticed by guests at the hotel as the service in the restaurants became ridiculously slow and many mistakes were made. The people of Sri Lanka our lovely and very kind and helpful and we felt totally safe when we wandered along the beach way from the hotel. We met a fantastic driver who was wonderful in showing us around and really looked after our children, he is a recommended driver at the hotel and his name is Erish. We had some absolutely wonderful experiences when he took us out as he really worked to make sure we saw everything and enjoyed ourselves, he is also a good driver and very safe which is quite a rarity in Sri Lanka!!!",negative

Food was very mediocre...mostly Sri Lankan cuisine. Hotel check out was quite haphazard...You need to get into a room to checkout but not at the reception, looks like government organization. Staircase is not kids friendly. There were no safety railing in the staircase; kids can fall through the staircase.

"Огромные неуютные пространства внутри отеля. Километровые пустые коридоры. Все, что за пределами номера как будто в запустении.

Десятки людей мельтешат туда - сюда, но толково помочь с конкретным вопросом они не могут. На ресепшне нас регистрировало 8 человек (!). Между ними был бардак и неразбериха. В итоге мы ждали 40 мин, чтобы отсунировали наши паспорта и дали оплатить комнаты. Нет оборудованной зоны на пляже. Отель стоит на первой линии и имеет прямой выход к океану, но территория для отдыха не оборудована. Нет лежаков, зонтиков, урн, охраны. Просто сеточный забор заканчивается и дальше иди себе сам на песок. Может кому-то такой дикий вариант и по душе, но я не смогла сидеть спокойно и читать на песке, потому что ко мне приставали все проходящие мимо мутные личности. Пяти минут не давали спокойно посидеть. Кто-то все время что-то продавал, предлагал, хотел поболтать и тд. Если бы отель огородил свою территорию, такого не было бы. Так что на дикий пляж по сути ходить не очень нужен комфортно. К тому же отель не чистит его. И песок завален пластиком и мусором, принесенным волнами.",negative

"Weitläufige Hotelanlage mit vergleichsweise großen und schönen Pools. Im September (Nebensaison) war das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis sehr gut (DZ inkl. Frühstück für 80€). In der Hauptsaison (Winter) liegen die Preise des selben Zimmers bei 150€ bis 250€. Das ist meiner Ansicht nach überteuert. Die Anlage liegt direkt am ruhigen Strand von Ahungalla. Außerhalb des Hotels gibt es nicht viel zu tun, da es in Ahungalla keine wirkliche touristische Infrastruktur gibt. Wer aber Ruhe sucht, ist im Heritance gut aufgehoben. Die Außenanlage ist sehr gefpflegt und verfügt über einen großen und alten Baumbestand. Schön für Kinder: es haben sich immer wieder Affen blicken lassen und es gibt viele Streifenhörnchen und Krebse zu beobachten. Die Brandung ist relativ kräftig, weswegen das Hotelpersonal eindringlich vom Baden im Meer abgeraten hat. Das ist aber fast überall in der Gegend so...

This way the guest has to do the work and not the Hotel. It should be the other way round ( but we‘ve noticed that in other sri lankan hotels). They‘re trying, but Just have other Standards.

"Heritance Ahungalle Hotel is a great retreat in Sri Lanka, but you must adjust your expectations before moving in. We had booked a de-lux room with balcony overlooking the beach and ocean - romantic, eh?Unfortunately, the hotel and consequently the room was very 'tired' and had seen better days. The hotel even suffered poorly maintained sidewalks, tennis courts, beach loungers, etc. Most was simply under maintained. Our balcony was adjacent to the rooms on either side, separated only by planters, and the view of beach and ocean obscured by a large (but beautiful) tree. It may not have been a problem anyway, as on the second day of our stay, the hotel maintenance people set up a huge beach-obscuring marquee (JAG_68056) for another wedding. They have about 20 weddings per year, so we learned. Perhaps that wasn't so bad either, but the band wars (wedding band, bar music, and local flute player) that ensued developed an impossible cacophony of loud music which made it impossible to sleep. Our 'package' was directly booked through Heritance's agent: bed and breakfast. We soon discovered there were many alternate 'packages' which ranged from full board to 'good deals' offering better accommodation for less than we paid. Check it out before 'checking in'. The food was good, especially the buffet (good value and variety) ... but the beach-hawkers were definitely a deterrent from enjoying the beach. The hotel should definitely do something about them! They were ever-present from sun up to sun down. The redeeming feature of the hotel was the always friendly and hospitable staff ... always willing to serve and support. The Guest Relations team did their very best. One last word of advice would be to insist that any Ahungalla-related transportation from Colombo Airport to the hotel take the new highway ... it seems that the drivers attempt to circumvent the highway-toll gates by taking secondary roads which are long, uncomfortable, dangerous, and nauseating. Happy travels!",negative

"Have just returned from a two week trip to Sri Lanka (Nov04) where we based ourselves at the Triton Hotel, Ahungalla. I must say although the hotel needs a overhaul ( due to be completed from May05toNov05) we had a wonderfull stay there. The food was excellant at all times. The initial room was also lovely but upon discovery of a small leak we were instantly upgraded to a suite with no questions asked by the hotel. What seemed to set the hotel apart was simply its level of service. All employees from maintenance to guest relations were excellent and couldnt do enough to help. Weddings were also a source of pleasure as the hotel puts a real show on with the dancers, elephant and evening fireworks. The only downside was the beach sellers who are quite persistent and initially put you off visiting the beach. However after a few days they recognise and it becomes far less a hassle. Altogether a lovely hotel experience for the price.",neutral

"Every so often even the mighty falter. What matters is recovery. After an impressive check-in, things went south at dinner. Inattentive service, cold food and total apathy left me wondering if this was the wrong place to spend three nights. I usually provide feedback at the end of my stay, but this bothered me enough that I penned an email to the corporate office that very evening. I did not expect a quick response. The next morning, with a fair amount of trepidation, I went for breakfast and was pleasantly surprised when a staff member approached me and apologized for the unpleasant experience the evening before. Before long another two managers stopped by to offer their apology. The balance of my stay was perfect. This property is beautiful. I was fortunate enough to get a room with an incredible view. The accommodations were comfortable and technologically up to date. The pool is huge and strategically located within 10 meters of the beach. I was on a half board plan and had the breakfast and dinner buffets during my stay. Good selection as well as taste. One of the days I ate lunch in one of the restaurants that offers a la carte service. I asked the chef to prepare lobster Sri Lankan style and it was absolutely delightful. All in all an excellent place for holiday in the Galle district.",negative

"We stayed here in January / February 2023. The hotel its self is a beautiful building and was immaculately clean and well maintained. as far as I could tell all the rooms faced the beach with either a balcony or terrace. Our room 219 was clean and well equipped with everything you would expect from a hotel of this standard. There are two pools one is a quiet pool where ball games etc are not allowed the other is for fun and games, the pool attendants are friendly and and attentive. There is also a reasonably well equipped gym and a spa which is really well priced. We found the staff to be so friendly and nothing was too much trouble every request was met with a smile and service was efficient and prompt. The food was very good although if I had one suggestion it would be to remember that not everyone likes spice in their food, my wife is one who does not and on occasions found her choices very limited, but then there was always cake!! To conclude I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough and should we decide to return to Sri Lanka (and I hope we do) we would certainly go back to Heritance.",negative

Location perfect. hotel is run down - needs TLC. Service is great at all times but prices at main buffet are ridiculous. WiFi is stable and reliable everywhere. Beach is awesome and pool area is great. Bar restaurant is good. Entertainment in the evening is 3rd. Rate and needs to be upgraded. Hotel was great in it’s heigh day but needs major updates to make it current. Staff try’s to cope with issues at all times.,neutral

"We stayed at the Heritance Kandalama and were expecting the same high standard we had there. Unfortuantely we were very dissapointed by the Ahungalla. How this hotel managed to win an award I will never know! The hotel is dirty and tired and the service at breakfast is worth a special mention for all the wrong reasons. Dirty tables left uncleared for hours, the most disgusting tea and coffee I have ever tasted in my entire life and service without a smile. The only thing positive I have to say about the hotel is its location and the morning walk you can take along the stretch of beach on your door step. However, a word of warning, there are beach sellers who try to befriend (hassle) you about every 20 mins so go for your walk early before they get up!! All I can say is thank goodness we didnt spend our entire stay here!",negative

"**Google Review for Heritance Ahungalla** Heritance Ahungalla is a stunning resort with a private beach and well-maintained pools. The rooms are neat, and the overall environment is clean and family-friendly. It’s a great place for a vacation with kids. However, the service leaves much to be desired. At check-in, the front desk staff greet you warmly and create an impression of excellent service, but the actual intention to help seems to be lacking. We traveled as two families and requested rooms close to each other. The staff promised to accommodate us the next day, but despite multiple follow-ups, no one informed us why it wasn’t arranged. Additionally, there were several service lapses: - When we reported non-functional TV services, no one responded. - An emergency housekeeping request was ignored until we followed up repeatedly every 30 minutes. - A simple request for bananas for a child after the paid breakfast buffet had closed was also ignored, with staff disappearing without fulfilling the request. While the staff are polite and pleasant in interactions, their inability to provide timely and reliable service is disappointing for a five-star resort. Compared to the service at The Kingsbury Colombo, Heritance Ahungalla falls significantly short. Overall, a beautiful property with potential, but the service experience needs serious improvement to match its five-star rating.",neutral
Hotel itself was very nice but our room smelled of mould at times. Also the service staff when they knew we were in our room had a habit of knocking on the door so many times it became obvious that in fact all they were after was a tip. I appreciate there is poverty in the country but this was the on thing which spoiled our stay. The meals in the restaurant were excellent each time. I would highly recommend staying here if you do not mind being 'tapped' for tips.,neutral
"Heritance Ahungalla was a mixed bag for me, despite the grand entrance, the hotel looked slightly dilapidated and we were disappointed to see that the boat in the swimming pool was absent. Given the age of the hotel, I expected the service to be more refined, and, except for an exceptional experience with a man called rukmal who was exceedingly hospitable, the staff seemed worn out and thus slightly disgruntled. In the buffet I had to ask the staff 3 times to obtain a cup of coffee. I got the impression that the staff were overworked, but wanted to help.The buffet was delicious though small( the dishes though were of a very high quality). The rooms were lovely, however, the triple room we booked was just a double room with an small, and uncomfortable foldable bed added on. As I came primarily for the wonderful location, and food, I was not particularly disappointed.",neutral
"Our check-in experience was smooth and quick. The room we stayed in was clean and spacious, which we appreciated. However, the biggest issue was that the AC in our room didn’t work properly, and we had to endure an uncomfortable, hot night. Although the maintenance team tried their best to resolve the issue, they were unsuccessful, and we received no apology or acknowledgment from the hotel management. On top of that, we were contacted about our check-out time, which added to the frustration. The food was tasty, but the buffet selection was quite average",neutral
"We had an amazing time at this hotel, during which we held a wedding ceremony and party with our friends and family. The hotel has 2 big pools and is directly on the beach. The staff were amazing in helping us arrange the wedding and catering to the needs of the party, in total there was 31 in the group. All the staff were amazing but in particular Shanika & Paveen created an event to remember and took away any stress we may have had in organizing everything. We had a ceremony on the beach followed by a BBQ, and the use of the on site nightclub. Everyone had a great day. All the party commented on how good the food was, we even had vegans and vegetarians who were happy with the food on offer. We will definitely be coming back to this hotel, as we have created many special memories here. We can highly recommend anyone coming to stay as you'll have an amazing time.",positive

"We booked this hotel for the second part of our holiday by the coast. We were swayed to book this hotel due to the raging reviews on Trip Advisor. Unfortunately it didn’t quite live up to our expectations, especially after leaving the Cinnamon Lodge in Habarana which was advertised to be a lower rating hotel. Our opinions do differ from those on here. The hotel is well known for the architect and so we expected something quite special, as it was also a ‘5’ star resort. On arrival the Loby is attractive as you can see through to a lush swimming pool right onto the sea. The swimming pools were the best bit of this hotel. They are lovely. However, we did find the hotel lacked character and that holiday feel. The architecture was a bit cold and bleak, very concrete, modern and minimalist. Somewhat like a business Hilton hotel which is just not we want on a holiday. The plants around the hotel seemed tired and a bit dead, just outside our room we overlooked a moulding wall where there used to be vegetation climbing up it. The hotel was all very open which was good for a natural breeze, but as soon as the monsoons came this caused a death trap of slippery hallways bars, seat cushions etc. The hotel rooms were nice, again modern but of good quality. The whole place lacked good lighting though. There was also the natural bare plastered look in the hotel bathrooms etc. Not our taste but might appeal to some. I personally like a bright lick of paint or something it bit more luxurious. The hotel did have good facilities if you wanted tennis, ping pong, badminton, spa’s etc. However going onto the beach was slightly annoying due to the persistent locals selling on the beach who would sit on the beach facing the hotel shouting at you to come and look as they will “give you good price”. This is a little off putting but I understand it’s just the way there. We never managed to go onto the beach without having to say no thanks to several different people. The restaurants and entertainment were the biggest disappointment. The food was always nice (wine expensive) but the restaurants lacked atmosphere. The main restaurant had set menus for most of our stay and these were quite pricey. The buffets in that restaurant were a bit better as at least you got more choice. But the restaurant is dark and dreary. No ambience. The a la carte “Cafe”? did have nice food but a bit limited on choice. You also don’t expect to have your a la carte meal in a cafe which lacked again any sort of luxury and really had the ambience slightly above that of a McDonalds. (I am being slightly harsh). The entertainment at the hotel was pretty poor. Sometimes there was a band singing the same songs every night. A cocktail promotion (doesn’t mean it’s a price promotion) with live demonstration. Or simply someone plays an instrument. It was very quiet during our stay so maybe they do more in the main season. We actually spent many of our nights at the Taj hotel in Bentota after this was recommended to us by fellow guests in the same boat as us. I suggest you go there just to get a comparison of what a 5 star hotel should really be like. We had a Chinese in the restaurant there and it was lovely. There buffet meals also had a great deal more ambience. Just grab a tuk tuk to get there. The Refresh restaurant 20 mins away in Hikkaduwa was also lovely. I recommend you stay in Bentota though if you want choice and to be able to walk out the hotel to more restuarants. There is nothing near the Heritance. Having said all that, if you want a quiet, clean relaxing hotel to just unwind sit by the pool and have early nights then it’s a great option. If you are lucky you will see some black monkeys around the hotel. We did get this hotel at a good price so we can’t complain I just believe the ratings on here are misleading. This is not to discredit the staff at the Heritance who were mostly all very helpful and nice people.",neutral
"Was here on a two night trip with the rest of my colleagues from office. Really not much to write home about. It didn't stand up to my expectations of a five star hotel. The staff was very courteous and helpful. There is no argument about that but the hotel infrastructure wasn't exactly that great. The car parks are somewhere way away that you have to rely on valet parking. This means you have to pick up every single thing you need from the vehicle before you check-in. The dining halls are pretty dark and gloomy, mostly I believe due to the dark colouring of the ceiling which is decorated with batik. The buffet area was really odd, it was almost like walking in to someone's kitchen to get the food served, the dining hall and the buffet area have very different vibes. The pool is good and well maintained and they do have some activity rooms where you could play 8-ball or carrom or chess. But the overall set up just put me off. Will not be returning here.",negative

"Having returned on 11th June after 12 nights at this hotel on vacation with my wife, I feel the need to express my gratitude for such an amazing holiday. My wife and I were married in Sri Lanka last year and we fell in love with Sri Lanka - we felt compelled to return to celebrate our 1st anniversary (but this time at a different hotel). As soon as we arrived - the first impressions were..........wow. The brochures do not do this stunning hotel justice. Having had a long tiring journey, we were given a very warm welcome. We stayed in a Suite which was superb in every way. The rooms are serviced daily by friendly housekeeping staff to a very very high standard. I am a Executive Chef who is in charge of a group of Companies providing Fine Dining Catering with bespoke menu's to wealthy clientele, so I was intrigued to find out whether this 5* hotel would impress. I need not have questioned this thought. After talking to The Food and Beverage Manager, I was invited to look around the kitchens and meet their brigade. The kitchens were immaculate, staff spotless, motivated and relaxed in their work - delivering the most delicious fine dining experience. With Sri Lanka's top medal winning Chef at the helm this comes as no surprise. If it is fantastic food and excellent service you require, then look no further. We will definitely return.",negative

"Me and my family stayed on FB basis for one day at heritance, ahungalle in october. the best thing was the food there. However, except for the welcoming staff at entrances staff was un or minimally attentive most of the time, of course they attend to us if we go and poke them repeatedly. we have booked a triple room and checked in around 4pm but there were twin beds in the room and after repeatedly reminding them they finally added an extra foldable bed. the person who brought the bed looked like a senior for that area, when we complained he just muttered something like 'twin bed room is the only room type available at heritance when you book a triple room and we always add an extra bed , only difference is you will get meals for 3 people' and walked away rapidly, on us... there were no room amenities in the room- no iron or ironing board, no water for three people, no slippers ,toothbrushes, cups etc at all. when we needed something we had to call and wait and call again . ultimately one person appeared with a trolley and instead of replacing missing items asked us to take whatever missing in the room. and the dark color pillow covers were so dirty we just kept them away. no one has bothered to change them for ages . safe was not functioning and when we typed numbers it missed some and got locked,then the person who attended late to fix it couldnt identify that its battery was low. finally it was fixed and by about 8.30 we managed to go for dinner. it may be due to overcrowded hotel but they already had 2 hours extra to check the room beforehand since we were late for check in. meals were good, staff was also more attentive. no one offered a baby high seater for our 3 year old and we had to go after them at all the 3 meals for a chair... restaurant is overcrowded and no one is there to offer water or clean tableware. they are only interested in taking plates away, at least that's a good thing. chefs and the restaurant manager were very supportive and offered some food for our baby , they were kind enough to deliver the dishes to our room as well. There is no sea view from the room and there was some construction work going on right next to our room which we didnt mind much.. next morning we asked them to take the plates away but no one showed up. by 1pm we were ready to check out and until that time no cleaning was done and room smelled of stale food. overall we didnt mind it as it was a one night thing ,tolerable on a full stomach and surely this place happens to be a typical siri lankan hotel, no matter how many stars they got,..",negative

"This is a nice hotel. We generally enjoyed our stay, but qualified by the comment below. Special commendation for the hotel's service staff who were very helpful and pleasant. The qualification: The hotel website features photos of lovely views of the ocean from the hotel's main dining areas and pool. Moreover, we booked a ""premium"" room to enjoy the view of the beach and the ocean that comes with these rooms. A guest of the hotel should have a reasonable expectation that was is displayed on the website regarding visual amenity is what they will get if they book. However, for much of our stay, the hotel's beach-side amenity was marred by the construction and deconstruction (over four days) of a large marquee running the entire length of the hotel's main access way to the beach. This marquee does not appear in any photo on the hotel's website. Its presence, in my view, thus represents a breach, however minor, of the contract between hotel and guest. Because full-fee-paying hotel guests were not put first in this regard, it is unlikely that we will return to this hotel.",neutral
"We visited Heritence Ahungalle for 2 nights in mid-April 2009. This was our second trip to the property having visited 5 years ago on our last trip to SL. Booked directly through the hotel website after comparing other similar properties such as Taj Exotica Bentota, The Fortress, Galle Fort Hotel and Eden Resort. Chose the Heritence given we had a wonderful stay 5 years ago. I wrote to the hotel inquiring about rates and was promised a free upgrade to a luxury room given that I was a returning guest. The hotel also stated that the property has been completely refurbished hence the drastic increase in price. When I got to the Heritence, I was told I would be given a deluxe room (the most basic room). I advised that I was promised a free upgrade to which I was told that they cannot honour this promise. They then advised that I could have an upgrade to a luxury room for an additional cost of Rs. 10,000 (US$86) per night. Given the higher cost I declined the upgrade and was quite disappointed. I had also requested a cot for my infant son when the booking was made. When I got to the hotel I was told that all the cots were in use. I complained to the General Manager who promised to look into it and get back to me, which he never did. We could not notice the refurbishments made to the property. The room we had looked very similar to the room we had five years ago as did the common areas. The property itself is beautifully maintained and is set on a stunning section of beach in SL. The main infinity pool and lobby area are very beautiful. The food is exceptional with a wide variety of choice all of which are of a very high level of quality. We visited this hotel during the Sri Lankan New Year and the hotel was full of local guests. We were blown away by the property and service on our last visit and were disappointed in the level of service during this trip (the GM has changed once during the past 5 years). I would say that we did have a good time and enjoyed the pool but would not likely return on our next trip to SL given they did not follow through on their promises.",negative

"we stayed 5 nights up to the 22nd sep in a luxury rated room which I upgraded to for £50 per night extra from a deluxe room they wanted £61 but a deal was done ,the room was fine good size .ac did not regulate cold or cold. in general hotel is very tired and needs a refurb,looking shabby the public areas in particular,chairs and tables in bars and restaurants are sticky thru not being cleaned properly. only really one main bar area next to main pool and reception this is completetely devoid of ambience and comforts hardly a good advert for checking in guests who are brought here. the a la carte restaurant next to the main dining room while serving reasonable food is dirty with table runners stained and dirty when restaurant manager challenged about theis he quickly had it changed the same night our food came out cold ,not good for curries!the meal was remade but it was too late the damage done,they tried to make amends with a free dessert please too little too late. the main dining room is where we took breakfast and on one occasion a buffet dinner,the tables and chairs again dirty also the table runner.food wise the breakfast is good also the dinner buffet with plenty of choices available. we tried the fine dining restaurant one night and it was very good my wife taking the new zealang beef and me the 2 fish curry price wise of course dearer than the other two dining rooms but light years superior which you would expect if you pay more but not expensive to European prices. a bone of contention ,if you have a wine list then maybe the odd bottle is out of stock,but it got to the point all that was left was the expensive wines costing £25 plus for what we get at home for £6 now I know all about mark ups but rip off! the daytime was spent by the resident only pool as this was the quietist and the pool attendant was very good at arranging our beds and towels on the same vain all the staff were very good one or two thrown in at the deep end I suspect with a poor lack of English in the restaurants. avoid the weekends as it fills up with locals on a freebie with their company and they are noisy and usually drunk playing drums at all hours. now while you are relaxing on your sun lounger near a pool you will be beckoned over to the hawkers trying to sell sarongs tee shirts or days out in a taxi,now they are not supposed to step over a line in the sand enforced by security guards but all day long they are shouting to you waving the sarongs etc,they stand on the boundary of the hotel and the beach which means the beach is a no go zone unless you don't mind saying no thank you many many times over. don't know what can be done they need to make a living you are trying to have a peaceful holiday. so to sum up after touring around sri lanka for a week we intended to chill out for 5 days didn't feel we achieved it so we do not recommend this overated hotel more 3 star.",negative

"A very warm, welcoming, beautiful resort. Our family spent 6 nights at the Heritance and will more than likely book again for the location and price. We booked online for a suite at a really good rate. As there was no way to book a luxury suite, we were hoping to be upgraded at checkin. As we are a large family, the benefit of the luxury suites 2 bathrooms would have been great. Unfortunately there were no luxury suites available when we arrived. Our room was clean and comfortable. We did notice the shower/bath combo would not drain properly and also collected a lot of water on the tubs edges which would spill onto the floor. We made do with towels placed in strategic locations. The food was very good and we absolutely loved the huge swimming pool. We even swam during a thunder shower. The location served as a great base to see all of the other sites Sri Lanka had to offer. Every staff member from the waiters, to the lifeguards, to the lovely gift shop employee was fantastic. Our kids were treated to a magic show, played pool and foosball, and loved the way our towels were folded into different animals upon arriving back to our room each night. Great stay!",positive

"This is absolutely not a 5 star resort - not by international or Sri Lankan standards. Everything from the small room to the aged gym and very basic amenities was a disappointment. The food is admittedly excellent but the restaurant staff have absolutely no sense of how to host more than 100 people. On the whole, the staff are friendly but typically clueless. Basic hotel processes such as charging drinks to a room or booking a spa appointment have proved very trying. Their cashier desk is simply a joke - patrons have to go to a little room in the back of reception to make small payments, as if they are in some bizarre 1950s public administration building. The overall impression is in fact an insult to guests who are paying a significant premium for their stay.",negative

"We stayed at this hotel for four days and it was the worst hotel experience ever. A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY AND A VERY EXPENSIVE DISASTER! I recommend reading the lowest reviews for this hotel before you book; there is a real discrepancy between the nightmare reviews and those that are praising this hotel. Make sure you understand what is the worst that could happen to you also if you choose to stay here, because the worst scenario did happen to us. We did not read what the low ratings on Tripadvisor said about the Heritance Ahungalla. We wished we did because so many of these complaints reflect our experience. My friend and I are both seasoned travelers, and have stayed in both five star accommodation and budget ones, all over the world. Given the cost of staying at this hotel, we were both incredibly disappointed and also traumatised during their stay. We felt so uncomfortable and threatened during our stay that we locked ourselves in our hotel room. We have lodged a formal complaint to the travel agency about our stay at the Heritance Ahungalla. Our main complaints are as follows: - Worst service: for the entire duration of the trip, the staff was incredibly rude. There was no ‘hospitality’. The staff pestered us repeatedly for tips, from the receptionist to cleaning staff to waiters. When we made all the complaints listed below to the staff, we were completely ignored and were shouted at. No attempts were made to apologise or to resolve the problems. We were incredibly frustrated by this, and were very close to tears. - Terribly unhygienic: stained bedsheets, dust and mould. Restaurant tableware and cutlery was not cleaned properly and had stains. - Pests: cockroaches, flies and mosquitoes in the bedroom and the bathroom. - Touts: The hotel was full of touts, from the pool to the beach, also pestering us and other guests to buy their goods. At one point, one of the touts even made a completely disgusting sexual advance on my friend! The hotel made no effort to safeguard the safety and/or privacy of their guests. - Food: the food was always lukewarm at best, and/or cold. Food would take at least 45 minutes to arrive. We ended up eating only burgers and fries for the four days that we were there, as it was the only food we felt was safe. For a holiday experience, this was disappointing. It would have been better to have just eaten McDonald’s. - Bad facility condition: The hotel is quite old, and many parts require fixing. A number of sunbeds were broken and completely unusable. We will never stay there again and are warning everyone who visits Sri Lanka to avoid this place. If you plan on staying there, at least read both the good and bad reviews to decide for yourself. There is a higher risk staying at this hotel, because of its location. It is incredibly far away from Colombo and any other properties, so if you arrive here and the hotel is a complete disappointment, there is no other property that you can escape to. BEWARE!",negative

But i felt really stressed as soon as i went near to the beach. You couldnt enjoy for some minutes, there were always some people who tried to sell you some stuff. That wasnt okay and the hotel shouldnt accept that.",neutral
"Planned to trip to Srilanka for my wedding anniversary with my entire family. After landing at the airport and a pleasant drive to ahungalla we reached this magnificent property that sprawls out from the entrance and the fabulous use of water spaces.

With excellent food, great all day activities, 2 superb pools, a stunning beach front and pleasing service this is one stay that will linger in memory for a long time.",positive

"We read all of the guide books and surfed the net before plumping for this hotel having spent the first night at the tired and desperately in need of a refurb Bentota beach resort , great pool sweaty sheets.... only 45 minutes from Galle, which is only worth a day trip any way if you ask me.... If you are looking for a beach side paradise with a modern room with quiet aircon and sliding doors onto a pool that is pure bliss for midnight swims then this cant be faulted. Food is great, plenty of options and places to eat, your room, the terrace, cafe or fine dining. Tennis, Snooker and yoga, not in that order.... We stayed in 5 hotels from Kandy, Nuwara, Dambulla and here. this was the best value and the most excellent. service was fab. Although all heritance hotels are good the one at Dambulla is triple the price for example; for food and beverages. Stay at the earls regeency or mahawali reach in kandy> tea plantation or St andrews in Nuwara Elya and the kandalama in Dambulla, expensive but a truely natural experience, like having a safari in your room! monkeys on the balcony, bats in the corridors and an infinty pool overlooking the wilderness. Snakes and lizards every where, in a nice way! oh and if you want golf the only place to play is the sublime course near Kandy at victoria. a real gem. Enjoy",positive

"This hotel's location is absolutely beautiful but the hotel rooms and after hours in -room dining are a real disappointment and are definitely not 5star worthy! However, the staff in the bar/ restaurant area are extremely helpful. I would definitely recommend to take their Romantic Dinner Set up on the beach which is extremely unique and a great menu. The peak of the hotel is the main swimming pool as it really is the focal point of the hotel. The pit of our stay is that we were not informed about anything during check in such as useful information like: you have the choice of enjoying your breakfast in your hotel room or the buffet concept restaurant & coffee and tea are complimentary during your stay (including in room dining orders!!!). All these points are great highlights which were not informed to us and we only found out by asking proactively asking questions or having the lovely surprise of not being charge for breakfast by in room dining. We really want to thank Front Desk Assistant Manager, Kansu (I think that's his name!) who looked after us during our stay and even surprised us by placing a happy anniversary cake in our suite. Overall, our stay was lovely but I feel that the hotel would benefit from a refurbishment as some areas of the hotel are a bit outdated or need a good clean up.",neutral

"The worst hotel I've ever seen. Traveled a lot. I don’t know where the positive reviews came from here, but it’s terrible. Dirty, the hotel is under construction (dirty construction workers eat with you at the next table, the dishes are dirty, the service is disgusting. During your vacation you listen not to the ocean, but to the sound of a jackhammer. The all-inclusive system is zero, you won’t wait for your cocktail (small choice). Bar from in the seventies. We got poisoned there (in response to our complaint, they said it was an allergy to curry), then other guys in this hotel got poisoned. The food was not tasty, the choice was small. After what I saw on the 4th day of our stay, I already had a showdown with the agent. , who sent us there with a tour operator and reached Colombo and Moscow, we were moved to another hotel in Rio (located nearby, the Heaven and Earth hotel is barely worthy of 2-3 stars, no more, very old with lazy staff,). the general lack of modern life, animation, etc. There are not enough sun loungers for everyone, there are 4 sun umbrellas for the entire hotel.",negative

"If you are going to visit this amazing desitination, head there soon and stay at the Heritance Ahungalla - a true oasis of calm and rejuvenation.

Word on the street is that next door to the Riu an 800 bed hotel is planned - ruination of the beach thanks to the developers who seem to be focussed more on quantity not quality.",negative

"We stayed beginning of August for 3 nights in the Junior Suite in Heritance Ahungalla. In general, the rooms are clean, the swimming pool is nice, especially for kids and also the beach is great. Unfortunately, like most 5-star hotels in Sri Lanka, also this one lacked essential things like a proper finishing in the room (the bathroom was a desaster, I cut myself several times at the glass door there), a very small TV only etc. The food was good quality, thoug a little expensive, but because we liked it we only ate at the hotel. The breakfast had a wide selection, and there was a big variety at the dinner buffetts, for example ""seafood grill night"" etc. The service was very poor, anything you wanted to do or to get took ages and did not work properly. On one saturday night there was a wedding with extremely loud music next to the second pool (where all the suites are localed; it was like a disco), and with still going on after 11 o´clock and the kids not being able to sleep I complained several times without success. It went on until 3 in the morning, which literally destroyed our next day and is something no 5-star hotel should accept. Many guests complained, but the management rather preferred to cash in the money for the ceremony instead of satisfiying their guests. Nevertheless we had altogether a good time, the animateurs at the hotel were dedicated and we had a lot of fun with waterpolo and beach volleyball. One last note: as generally in Sri Lankan 5 star hotels, they overprice taxis etc. by 300 to 400%. Just go out of the hotel and rent a taxi or tuc-tuc there, as next to the savings the locals know all the places to go.",negative

"I have just returned from a one week stay at this hotel. The day of my arrival was Independence Day and therefore preparation for celebrations were in full swing, funnily I immediately felt part of the hotel. The staff were lovely, helpful, calm and polite even when I was a bit fraught with things not exactly working out as planned from my travel company. Lazy days on the beach were marred by enthusiastic beach vendors, however with the help of a German guest I managed to negotiate a good price for a silk scarf having told myself ""I am most certainly not going to buy anything from them!"" Sri Lankans are welcoming people and not all are after your money, although I did find the tipping to the hotel staff obligatory which got embarrassing, if not down right annoying one guy round the pool seemed to want tipping to speak to me! Yet another saved my sunbed all morning for only a smile. On my last morning my pick up time was some unearthly early morning hour, but the kitchen staff managed to lay on my own personal buffet breakfast AND I received a breakfast picnic to take with me to the airport. Food was mediocre but good a selection at breakfast, dinner with my half board was a bit ""breakfast warmed up"" with some dishes, although as a vegetarian my tastes were well catered for plus an offer of my personal selection from the chef. A Fawlty moment one evening when I asked for a black coffee to complete the meal. I was told ""Coffee off, no more coffee, sorry coffee is finished"" err is this a hotel? this was rectified when a member of the waiting staff later turned up with my coffee. It needs more polish. Little things like a stain on the table cloth, cloudy glasses, no hair conditioner, a chip on the bathroom mug,a stain on the net curtains in my room and the corridor to the room looked more ""seaside guest house"". They were improving the walls on the stairs of the hotel with stencilling. A warning, I hit my head on a metal plank balanced precariously between the bannisters where the ""artist"" stood. Health and Safety in the UK would have closed it down. I did mention it and the reception staff thanked me for drawing it to their attention. The plank remained. The hotel was over all quiet and the music went on till only 10.30pm I did like an early night but the music was pleasant enough despite hearing it in my room and as I say it was only to 10.30pm. The hotel did seem to regulate conferences/weddings to noise minimum and respect to their guests. It might pass for a 4 star only Sri Lankan style but it was not 5 star. Too many rude Russians but this is not a hotel issue just a way of life on holiday now.",negative

"Room= nice bed, good view nice balcony alot of ants though. Kind of a walk and no lift. Spacious. NO IRON. Bathroom= overall good bathroom clean and we'll equipped. Restaurant= A La carte= expensive for pasta and one pasta looked freshly made other looked like it had been in the microwave and it was disgusting even the waiter said it wasn't good.But didn't care. Kind pushy for us to get drinks when we specified water 3 times. Food took 2 long and like I said quality was bad. Buffet= nice buffet girl was good and since my wife didn't eat just wanted pineapple she said it was ok and let us just get pineapple and one buffet so she was friendly. Really good variety and service was good. Breakfeast= breakfeast was ok. Only happy person was the one making our waffles this was April 27 by the way. He was answering our questions and was good at what he was doing always working. Asked for late check out and got it til 2 thank you very much. And also check out was the worst. Fyi always get an outside cab hotel gets you a cab. EXPENSIVE and not worth it. And waited 20 minutes for my bags to come down( the lift is only for them). Beach however is awesome just people trying to sell u things as soon as u put one foot out the hotel. Beach was empty so perfect only me my wife and like 2 other people. Awesome beach.",neutral
Shocking!!!!!!!!! Do not come here.,negative
"We finally decided to give this hotel a shot as we were traveling through the area mainly due to its architecture (Jeffrey Bower design) and location. Sadly this place failed us. Trivago lists the room that we were given for around $90 US. We paid $175 per night for the two day stay with the full understanding that we'll be getting a decent room. I was expecting much better accommodations given it's the off season and the hotel in near empty. Firt room we got was so bad that I refused it immediately. They then moved us to a different ""deluxe"" room, as I was told, which was marginally better than the first one. The bathroom is dirty, no bath robes in the room and the view is sub par. The room is located in the far corner of the hotel. It is a smoking room and we were not offered the option to choose whether we needed a smoking room or not. It's puzzling to me that the hotel staff felt this room is consistent with a 5 star hotel. I'd rate this place and our experience at 3 stars at best! I've given them two opportunities to rectify the situation and they utterly failed both times. They've had a golden opportunity to wow us and grantee a repeat customer but for some reason, that I still can't understand, they chose to make sure that we will not come back again. In this copetitive field, where there are many other options availabe, the accommodation we've received is not what I had expected from a Heritance chain (Kandalama in contrast was fantastic). We'll be in this country 3 more days and was hoping to to spend it in this area had they met our expectations. Instead we'll be moving to the Hilton in Colombo for the remainder of our stay. Needless to say that this is the first and the last time for us in this perticular facility. Situation of this type do not warrant a third chance. To the management team... look very closely into the culture that is set forth. I don't think you can afford to have customers like us, who travel all over the world and are often in Sri Lanka, to be this dissatisfied with your facilities. Every one that complains on a site like this, ten goes without taking the time to do so yet they are just as dissatisfied. You're alianating the very customers that is your life blood. This is an absolute self inflicted wound.",negative

"This is a great hotel in many ways. It is a Bawa design so the actual structure and lay out of the resort is outstanding. The rooms are well appointed with great showers. But for the price and the history of the place I thought the resort could have been better. 1) The resort falls down in comparison to other world class hotels in the details. For example, every room is given a fruit basket designed to resemble a traditional Sri Lankan out rigger. This is a great touch but the problem is that the boat basket was quite broken and falling apart. It should have been replaced long ago. There are examples of this where a good idea is not quite executed correctly. Another example was the intrusion of more conventional resorts into the appearance of this heritage building: in the bar area upstairs there was a Red Bull fridge displayed quite prominently. Does anyone truly think Bawa would have approved of such a thing? Of course not. It disrupts the entire point of a place built by Bawa and damages the aesthetic. The managers should be aware of this. 2) The food was okay but was a mass produced buffet designed to accommodate a large number of people. This led to the food becoming pretty routine after a few days. We also found that it was difficult to get the attention of staff and I found they were not very attentive. Sometimes we had to ask twice for something simple like water. My feeling was that they were very understaffed. 3) A big issue for me was the mattresses. I have some muscular skeletal problems so sleeping on a hard bed is not good for me. But the beds at Ahungalla were very hard. In general I cannot understand why they would not get medium softness beds to accomodate everyone's needs. These may seem like small details, but for the price, for the fact it is a 5 star hotel, and because of its history and heritage, I think the place could do better. Having said that, it is certainly a considerable step up from the majority of large resorts on the SL coast.",neutral

"They say first impressions are everything!! We knew we were in for a rough time as soon as we arrived. On arrival we were shown to a scruffy bar area with tatty leatherette seats which were all torn and ripped. For the third time in 6 days in Sri Lanka we were taken to a really horrid room (No. 228)!! OMG what a dump - we had paid for a king-size luxury room and what we got was a prison cell twin!! It was filthy, pokey, run down and utterly horrid. Needless to say we made a fuss and were initially told we would have to pay for an upgrade!! We were finally upgraded to a suite gratis. Unfortunately this was not much better!! The hotel is in a terrible state and is in dire need of major renovation. One of the biggest problems in this hotel is the design. This hotel is celebrated for it's design and architecture but in my opinion this is misplaced. All the bathroom walls are simply skimmed concrete which gives them a horrid dingy, dirty prison cell-like appearance. There were no curtains - just these filthy heavy shutters which moved in filthy tracks. The blinds were broken, filthy and flaking!! Pillows were stained. The remote control for the TV was held together with sticky tape, the hotel guide book was covered in sticky dried food, the chair at the desk was filthy and the mini-bar fridge was rusty and leaking water. The final straw was the insect life living in the room!! We were tired, upset and ready to leave. By this time it was very late at night and we contacted our travel agents in UK and told them we wanted to return to UK asap. We were told there was nothing that could be done until the morning. We spent a very uncomfortable night and waited to see what would happen. Well; we had obviously stirred the hornets nest!! Next morning we were contacted by the front of house manager and within minutes we were surrounded by loads of staff members apologising and promising to make things right. After a short while we were upgraded again to a genuinely luxury suite which was lovely. Clean linen, clean floors, curtains and the biggest jacuzzi I have ever seen!! Throughout the whole process all of the staff at the hotel were wonderful and helpful and charming!! We enjoyed the rest of our stay. Once this hotel has been renovated it will be fantastic, if you are looking for a stunning beach resort. The location is idyllic. The buffet restaurant is good with plenty of high quality options - western and local cuisine. Make the most of the area - hire the bikes that the hotel offer and enjoy the amazing countryside. - we spent a couple of hours cycling through the local village. What a treat!! Giant Monitor lizard by the side of the road, buffalo wandering towards us on the road, local farmers working in the paddy fields surrounded by cattle Egrets and monkeys jumping through the trees!! It was very hot but one of the highlights of our trip. A day trip to Galle was very worthwhile as were trips to the local towns. The local Turtle hatcheries are wonderful but beware the 'Spice Gardens' - rip-offs aimed squarely at parting unwary tourists from their cash!! I was genuinely shocked at the number of people putting their towels on the pool-side loungers before breakfast and then obviously spending the whole day baking and drinking beer. Bloody long way to go for skin cancer and to not experience all the amazing sights, people and wildlife this wonderful country has to offer!!",negative

This was our first time visiting heritance ahungalle and we were looking forward to a relaxing weekend. First up when we arrived our room wasn't ready and even though I had specifically requested for a king size bed since we were travelling with our son instead of individual beds this too was not taken into account. After sitting in the lobby for over 30 minutes we were finally taken up to our room . The luggage however was not brought to the room and after waiting a good 30 minutes we had to go looking for it. As for the food we found it to be basic and lacking in flavour. Breakfast was much better as it had a variety with many local dishes and seasoning. I found it bizarre that very little seafood was on the menu being a sea side hotel. The staff were attentive and went to the extent of asking if anything special was required for our son. Location is beautiful and rooms are good. Need to improve in food and urgency of staff In getting things done.,neutral

"Right on the beach, 2 beautiful pools, and really lovely staff - who are definitely the major asset. But WHY do the bathrooms look so unclean? our shower screen was limescaled (heavily), the floors and walls needed upgrading as they were scuffed and marked and impossible to clean (polished concrete walls au naturel! - but evidently the architect who designed them loves the effect so it doesn't matter!). On the plus side the bed was wonderfully comfortable. Breakfast was in a low ceilinged dark room (often smokey from the cooking of bacon or hoppers) - where you help yourselves but have to wait for tea/coffee (i.e. flag down a waiter if you can catch their eye - although there are always plenty of them around) - and geared to Big Appetites and touring parties. The dinner buffet food in the same room was lukewarm and no one attends it to ensure it is stirred/kept hot. The menus are very restricted. Where are all the delicious tastes of Sri Lanka? Why travel all this distance to eat (mediocre) European food! The middle range restaurant (I think it was called Mustard) with a terrace overlooking the pool was the best, as the food was cooked to order, and the staff more than willing to experiment with something off the menu if they had the ingredients. The beauty salon was staffed by wonderful Balinese girls who gave a very good deep tissue massage - but the standard of the treatment rooms (just converted bedrooms) was poor. Expect more ambience for the price. Not 5* by European/International standards and more expensive for food/drink than the Amangalla or the Galle Face.

"I have just had the experience of checking in my friend and his wife to the Heritance, it looked ok on the way in but the outlook is very sterile, having read most of the reviews about their coffee shop we eventually made it there after a labourious check in, I suggest to the management that they should send their coffee shop staff into the Capital city colombo to the almost genuine 5 star hotels to find out what a Capucino and a Cafe Latte is and how it is made and presented, we had 2 cups of ordinary coffee with a bit of milk froth on top and were charged the best part of 5 USD for this pathetic version of a Capucino and Latte, I don't mind paying 5 star prices but please please provide us with a 5 star cup of coffee, and how in heavens name do hotels classify themselves as 5 star, a ordinary 3 star hotel in Thailand will knock spots of any so called 5 star hotel in Sri Lanka, very very disappointed.",negative

"After coming from Heritance Kandalama we expected the same. This is not the case. I did not want to jump on here and be outright negative, but there is good and bad here. Our room has a broken aircon, bathroom exhaust fan, telephone and main door lock, with no safe. Pretty alarming. Our guy that cleans the room is wonderful and has tried his best to get everything fixed up. So far the kettle has been replaced. They have tried to fix the phone several times with no luck. Reception rings you constantly but you can not talk to them, very annoying. Outside the gates are pushy tuk tuk drivers in a dirty street. Surprising since Sri Lanka is a very clean country with mostly beautiful helpful people. Not here though. We were really looking forward to a few days in the pool looking at the ocean after a pretty hectic schedule. As soon as you get to the pool the yelling people on the beach trying to sell dodgy wares ruins it straight away. Even security and staff were called several times to try and help ripped off tourists. But security does nothing. It is like they work with them. After all the places we have stayed in Sri Lanka this is the worst. We would not come back here again.",negative
"As a well travelled guest, Heritance Ahungalla was one of the worst hotels I have been to. My friends and I arrived at the hotel after a long day, expecting the welcome they advertise. But we were greeted with nothing and yet I noticed the foreign tour group next to us at the hotel were getting a great welcome. The foreign guests were given a welcome drink in front of me and even when j was checking in, nothing was really done. This was extremely disappointing to see as their attention was on the foreign guests, even though the hotels are kept afloat by locals even in times of crisis. In a sense, it felt as if I and my friends were purposefully ignored at the welcome to focus on white people. Next, the rooms were OK and clean with the needed amenities. The pool was ok and the environment was relaxing and calm. But the Jacuzzis are broken and one was unusable. This really dampened the experience. Thirdly, the buffet. The food experience was TERRIBLE. I stayed ful board for 2 days and the food was the same everytime. There was not much variety and so, it was really disappointing. At one point during lunch, I found MOLD in my food!!! The same night during dinner, my friends and I ate carved roast pork and the meat was rotten. It smelled bad and when I ate a bite, it was so rotten and I had to throw it away. The breakfast buffet had some diversity and was enjoyable. The staff is nice and accommodates our wish. The bar makes a really good cocktail called the green pool. Other than that, it was a poor experience. Serving bad food to guests and ignoring local guests to focus only on foreign guests was what made me write this review. I never badly review anyplace I travel to unless its horrible, like ahungalla was. It did not serve a purpose to my business trip either. Would never visit again.",negative

"We ended off our holiday in Sri Lanka at this hotel, booked in for 3 nights. It was a perfect decision as it was pure bliss and relaxation. The hotel offers various amenities to allow you to unwind, with two swimming pools (one overlooking the ocean and another more secluded) while being situated along the beach from where you can take a dip into the ocean. Other amenities include table tennis, a gym and in-house entertainment such as live music and performances. The staff service is friendly, efficient and professional, while the food is good (not too spicy overall but a decent array to choose from). Our dining experience was made memorable with exceptional service from Malake during breakfasts and dinners. The rooms were clean, comfortable and spacious with a balcony overlooking the ocean. The hotel premises were always kept neat and tidy while offering sufficient space to walk around or relax on a pool chair. Overall I would certainly recommended this hotel to any couple or family looking for a place to relax and unwind while being taken care of at a world-class and luxury hotel. Many thanks.",positive
"This hotel was a great disappointment for us. This was our sixth night in Srilanka and when we made the bookings we were so excited about this hotel and the photos we have seen. However, our stay there was a disaster! We waited for more than 30 mins to Check in. When we checked it, the room was in a mess and the telephone lines were not working. We complained to the reception and all they said that this was because of the rain and it will come back within 10 mins but it didn't. We tried again but it was useless. The receptionist and the staff were rude and their service was far below the standards. to make things worse, there was a school trip that night and the kids occupied the swimming pool, the restaurant and everywhere in the hotel. The restaurant was expensive and the food was average but the service was a little bit better than anywhere else in the hotel. The room was small but the balcony was nice. In general I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. If you still want to go there, then please ensure that you are in the middle of the week and not on Saturday/Sunday or Friday to avoid the busy times at the hotel where the service drops down to the lowest level.",negative

"I chose this hotel because it was designed by Geoffery Bawa. The rooms and resort are lovely, but definitely in need of upgradation in many areas. The upper floors look like they've been refurbished, but the lower floors have not. Upon check in, we realised the air conditioning in our room wasn't working, we got twin beds, when we had requested a king size bed and the wi-fi was intermittent.

Always receive a warm greeting at arrival, mouth watering food, fantastic rooms, beautiful garden, excellent service delivery. We benchmark other hotels to Heritance. Keep up the good work!",positive
"The beginning of the holiday started in a very disappointing way. We arrived at the hotel at 2PM on time for check in. However we were informed that the rooms were not ready. As a result we had to wait for over two and a half hours to get our rooms which was a very disappointing experience to start a vacation. The excuse given by the staff was that the guests have not vacated the rooms on time. This is not a plausible excuse. The hotel should know when to call and inform guests that they need to check out on time. The least they could do then is call us and let us know there is a delay so that we can plan to arrive late to the hotel. My mother who is elderly had to sit for along time in the reception area and found it difficult to walk afterwords as well. We actually decided never to come back to this hotel again but we changed our minds after the experience afterwards. The staff in the hotel mainly the room maintenance and restaurant staff were very polite friendly and courteous. Never before had we experienced such a good service from staff in any other hotels we had been to. Another plus point was the food. The food was excellent. There was a wide variety and it was very tasty. One negative aspect is that we stayed one night on a day where there were less guests. On this day the food variety was not there and that was a bit of a undermining experience for us. Another unsatisfactory experience I faced was with the pool attendant. When I went to the swimming pool I asked the pool attendant for a towel. His reply was that the hotel had instructed him to inform guests to bring their room towels. This seemed very odd to me as I saw other patrons having pool towels. Anyway I proceeded to have a swim and I could not dry myself as I had no towel and I had to go to the room all wet. With the cold wind blowing I could have got pneumonia as well but thankfully that didn't happen. Later on I called the reception to clarify this and they said that the pool attendant should have given me towels and that he had given me false information. In any case I do hope the hotel takes this experience as a learning and inform their pool attendants as to not to refuse to give patrons pool towels. Finally I would like to say that the hotel did allow us to have a late check out in order to compensate for the delayed check in. Overall I would say that I would come back to Heritance Ahungalla due to the friendly and polite staff and the good food. However I hope that I will not face the unpleasent expeirnces I mentioned above, the next time I visit.. Dilshan Thambawita",negative

"Heritance Ahungalle was definitely worth a stay in Ahungalle. It's located right on the edge of Galle Road and is easily accessible. The check-in & check-out was fast, efficient and seamless. The staff was very polite and warm. The rooms (although a little dated) have star-class amenities (hot water, kettle, tea/coffee, TV, free WIFI etc). The beach is just near the hotel and the two large swimming pools offer a very good time to relax! My only complaint is with regards to the food. Not to say it was bad, but it could use more variety and flavour too. Other than that, it was a lovely hotel to stay at!",positive

"Wir hatten das Deluxe Zimmer mit 2 Einzelbetten gebucht! Unser Zimmer entsprach in keinster Weise der Beschreibung und den Bildern bei Booking.com. Das Zimmer war klein!! Ich denke, dass kleinste im ganzen Hotel! Der angeführte Sitzbereich war nicht vorhanden, er hätte auch gar keinen Platz gehabt. Um die Klappe zum Wasserkocher öffnen zu können, musste man den Kasten verschieben, der Schreibtisch war im Weg. Safe war auch keiner vorhanden, wurde uns aber auf Nachfrage in den Kasten gestellt. Bei unserem Zimmer stand der Zusatz: Free room Upgrade upon available, Early Check In&Late Checkout upon available...war leider nicht möglich, mit der Begründung, dass Hotel wäre voll. Wir waren eine ganze Woche dort und bemerkten, dass dem, allem Anschein nach, nicht so war! Wir hatten das Zimmer nur mit Frühstück gebucht, hätten im Hotel gerne das eine oder andere gegessen oder getrunken. Das kommt aber wirklich teuer, ein Teller French Fries knapp 10 Euro! Es kommt bei allem,was auf der Karte steht noch insgesamt 28% dazu! Schade!",negative

"I don’t mind staying in 3 star or less and judge them on that criteria , this is the type of hotel I object too , pretending to be a 5 star when it clearly is not . This is a recently updated 3 star at best First Pros Good location , right on the ocean , nice pools that faces the sea , rooms are adequate . Couple of excellent staff , housekeeping and the lady at the buffet Cons Bear in mind this is a 5 star hotel ( allegedly) Two hot tubs , one uncovered and has foot of water the other boarded over with no sigh of life . Broken paving stones by the second pool Old and tired towels at the pool Sun beds all peeling Blinds that come down in poor weather to protect the hotel are shredded and broken Rusty bin in bathroom, Paint peeling in the shower No USB points , Plastic seal on the bedroom shutter coming away Service is sooooo sloooooooooowwwwww Asked about ice cream at the 5 star buffet and told its not included . Sulky waiters 5 star gym is old, 8 year old machines , no matts , What I find suspicious is that all the glowing reviews mention nothing about the tiredness of the place and they are generally written by people with less than 5 reviews to their name , hmmmmm Only here for a couple of days but would be very angry if I had booked a week at a “5 star hotel” to find this",neutral
"This place was amazing. From our arrival we felt very welcome here. The staff were very friendly and helpful. They were always on hand to help with a smile and were immaculate in presentation. The location of the hotel is idyllic, the pool was fantastic & the room was perfectly clean and practical. The food was 5* quality, great selection to choose from and reasonable at cost. Take the buffet breakfast! You may see an elephant wandering the grounds ;) This hotel had plenty of character, there were activities going on all day & entertainment in the evenings. We even got to try scuba diving in the pool. The spa was fantastic, we had hot oil massages which were just heavenly. We were very happy with our stay here, we only stayed 2 nights - We will be back again for sure! I cannot recommend this hotel enough!",negative
We had 4 nights here at the end of a tour and it was by far the worst of the hotels we had stayed at. No problem with the room (though our friends managed to get their room booked out whilst they were in it!) but the service on two nights in the Coffee Shop and the Upper Dining was VERY slow. Added to this was the meat when it arrived after 90 minutes (!) in our meal at the Upper (Fine) Dining was overcooked in part and a lump of fat for the duck! This was very disappointing as we had been introduced to the company's head chef at a previous hotel. The Jade restaurant (buffet) was good both for dinner and breakfast though.,negative

So I warn some indians going there no proper bf dinner also available for indians . No action was taken after I complained the management too.,negative
This hotel is hit or miss. We stayed in a beautiful room but had a view of trash and falling apart tennis courts. There were ants in our room. There are some nice areas (main pool) and some very run down areas (spa area). The beach is nice and long but water is rough with currents and rip tides. The breakfast buffet and lunch buffet were plentiful so it was easy to find food for each preference. The service was good but slow. It took us 20 minutes to check out through some outdated cashier methods (spa had to bring a paper copy of their charges while we waited).,negative
"We checked in to the room not knowing they have given us a twin room. What made us upset was the girl who escorted us to the room Dinushi, the excuse she gave was ""if you checked in early we would have given you a better room"" I was stunned! I immediately told them that we will be checking out the next morning even though we were booked for two nights. It was around 6pm when we checked in and we were too tired after traveling from colombo otherwise I would have definitely checked out the same night. Room was so small and very dirty and old. Bathroom was very small and mind you a huge cockroach was running over our bathroom amenities imagine using rhose tooth brushes and soap and those refill type shampoo bottles which were anyway spilt. I was so upset I cabt tell you how much because we were there to celebrate a birthday. It was all ruined. Later on the duty manager came and ask whether we would do a room change and said the hotel was full but we didnt want to trouble the house keeping staff as we were anyway going to check out next morning. Food at the restaurant was ok but not the best of heritance maybe the reason why was because all the guests were locals. Restaurant staff was good. Friendly. Next morning when we came down to the lobby to check out, i cant believe the same girl Dinushi's attitude towards us. Even though I looked at her she made sure to frown at me. Not bothered to atleast talk to us nor apologize. Wow I am from the same industry and I cant imagine the way she acted. Sadned by the fact that we are from the same industry yet we've been disrespected this way. I am disheartened to write all this because as hotelliers we all have so much expectations from Heritance hotels.",negative

"We recently stayed here for two weeks and have to say had a great time. The hotel and grounds are lovely. It is right on the beach front which is beautiful. I can only comment on the room we had which was a deluxe room with partial sea view. The only reason it states partial is because there are palm trees and bushes between the room and view but it was lovely all the same. The room was spacious and had everything we needed. Lovely basket of fruit on arrival which was refreshed in the second week. Bottled water Daily and a mini fridge full of soft drinks, alcohol, crisps and chocolate. Rooms were cleaned daily and beds turned down each night, fresh towels twice a day. Lovely towel art left each day. The room cleaners really are a credit to the hotel. Although I have to say all the staff are a credit. All very helpful and pleased to help. Food was amazing. We were on an all inclusive basis which we wouldn’t normally do but would recommend as not much nearby outside of the hotel. Great selection of meals all day. Have to say we were in curry heaven. Good selection for non curry eaters! Many reviews say Diet Coke isn’t included in your drinks package which concerned me being diabetic, however they actually have Coke Zero which is included. Wine is only served at meal times in the A.I. Package. Two great pools in the grounds, we spent our time by the quiet pool. Bars were good but we spent most of our time at the pool bar were most of the entertainment was in the evenings. Some of the shows a bit bizarre but that’s A.I. for you. The days spent on the sun beds were filled with sightings of monitor lizards, chipmunk type creatures and monkeys roaming the grounds. Whilst here make sure you get out and about there is so much to see. We used a local guide who was a fraction of the price of tui who we travelled with. Found him prior to going and booked all our trips via him before going, didn’t require payment until we arrived and met him personally.There are lots of local guides inc ones on the beach and the money stays local. *** Try Charu of czarek tours *** you can find him on Facebook or at charukadesilva5@gmail.com Also don’t listen to tui when they say you have to use your rupees up before the airport or exchange what you have left in the departure lounge prior to going through security. You can spend them in the airport!! Finally we would like to thank all the staff at the Heritance for making our holiday so special. I would certainly stay here again if we return.",positive

"The hotel is situated in Galle road, Ahungalla and can easily be accessed by a public bus. The hotel was good, clean, and the food was nice. The hotel is built with an antique look/theme however. The old rooms are a bit gloomy and therefore, you might want to spend some extra bucks and ask for a newer/premium room (which I got). There are two large pools and there are 2 small jacuzzis (no extra fee) next to one of those pools!",positive
"I woul not recommend this hotel. Specially if you plan to come here on vacation during weekdays. They host weddings and the noise level is really high. We experienced this on a Thursday night where the band that was playing, played until 11 pm at night. It is not a relaxing experience. The noise was overwhelmingly loud. We called the management but they said the loud outdoor music will go on till 11 pm. The service at the restaurants were very slow and unresponsive too. The bars served cocktails that wasn't made properly. It was a disappointing experience at this hotel for us. Will not return here",negative

"We stayed here for a few nights in August 2010 as part of a one month trip. I was very excited about staying here as it was designed by one of my favourite architects, Geoffrey Bawa. However, it was a little bit of a let down on a whole. On arrival the hotel is lovely. You drive through some large gates and up to the open reception area where you immediately notice the infinity pool which looks great. All the staff are very smiley but unfortunately the front desk staff don't really know what they are doing. There was a lot of commotion and we did not get checked in for an hour. Some of our friends did not get checked in for 2 hours. Not what you want after a long journey! First impressions of our room were ok. They are clean but nothing special. We were promised a spectular suite as we were there for a special occassion but we were just given a standard deluxe room which was disappointing. We eventually got our suite on our last night but the only difference was a bit more space and a bath so not really worth the extra money in my opinion. We spent a lot time around the infinity pool which is very clean and the pool boys are great. They provide water aerobics every morning and organise water volleyball straight after so it's a bit lively around that pool up unti lunchtime. There is another pool but we didn't use it. If you like your exercise there is also a small gym which is ok. It's small and basic but has the essentials. You can also go for a run along the beach but as with almost every beach in Sri Lanka be prepared to get hassled by the beach boys/women. One guy came for a run with me whilst trying to sell a tour which I thought was very amusing. Unfortunately I could not give him any business! The food here is great. There is a huge variety on offer and you won't be disappointed. However, if you order snack food be prepared to wait or for the staff to get your order wrong. This seemed to be the norm from our experience and speaking to other guests. The same goes for ordering drinks. They are super slow. You can quite often see your cold drink getting warm on the bar whilst the waiters have a chat. People were constantly chasing up the waiters or walking up to collect their own drinks. The staff, with a few exceptions, seemed to be the main problem at this hotel. They are all very friendly but even the simple things seemed to be an effort. Luckily we have a lot of patience so we found it funny but it was obvious some couples and groups there were getting very frustrated. We stayed at several other hotels in Sri Lanka and the staff were a lot more on the ball. Even when we checked out it became chaos. Lot's of confusion, incorrect bills and in one case it took nearly 1.5 hours! It was a group of 6 but still, not acceptable. We took 30mins and there was only 2 of us. To sum up, this hotel is nice. It has character but it is certainly not 5 star. The rooms and staff could be so much better. My plus points would be the infinty pool and the food. Everthing else could do with improvements. I would recommend this hotel but on the basis don't go there expecting the ultimate paradise. It's good but there is better in Sri Lanka. It's pretty good value for money but needs some attention. 7.5/10 overall.",neutral
"The worst hotel. I do not recommend his visit to anyone 🤦🏻‍’️ Cheating and spinning accounts. Without a statement, 20% tax is included. Why???? The manager has no plans to deal with the problems adequately, instead of explaining or at least apologizing for the negative situation , and due to the incompetence of the workers, yelling at the guests The worst hotel ever. Dirty towels, bathrobes. Old interior",negative
"The hotel is very beautiful and has 2 pools, and spa facilities. One of the pools had a live entertainer playing some sort of traditional flute. The location of the hotel is convenient as it's directly next to the beach. We tried the massage and the spa facility, and it was very good, although a bit expensive when compared to other 5 star hotels in Sri Lanka. The rooms were tidy and well equipped. The bathroom is a bit small, but up to the standards. As with previous Heritance hotel we visited, the bottles of shampoo and shower gel need to be reviewed from an ergonomic point of view. They are difficult to pour from, either you pour too little or too much. On the down sides, the check-in process took around 30 to 40 minutes. Not sure why. The buffet was a disappointment. After all the great things we encountered in this hotel, we were looking forward to an amazing gastronomic experience. However the buffet was poor in terms of both variety and quality. We happened to be at the hotel on a full moon (Buddha Day), which is a holiday in Sri Lanka. Maybe that was the reason for the bad quality of the buffet, due to lack of staff? I'm not really sure. In general it was a pleasant experience and would recommend staying at the hotel.",neutral

Stayed here with my wife after a week in a hotel in the north of Sri Lanka. The food in the buffet was extremely poor. The al carte was very expensive which would of been ok if the food was good but it was terrible. We had bolognese one day and the spaghetti had been cut up in to tinny pieces or they had served us the crumbs at the bottom of the packet. Second time we ate there the lasagna was also terrible. It had been reheated so much that that the pasta literally could not be cut let alone eaten. When we complained it took nearly half hr and a six man conference In the kitchen to come to the conclusion that it was not edible. We then decided to try the fine dinning restaurant only to find out it was the same chef from the al carte restaurant ! We ate in local restaurants from then on which were really nice and a fraction of the price. Finally upon checking out we were charged for basically the entire mini bar ! After disputing this are bill was quite quickly adjusted to what we had actually taken from the mini bar. In conclusion the hotel is drab over priced and you are extorted at ever opportunity ! My advise would be to keep well away,negative
I had a problem when I was having a shower. Water suddenly stopped. I informed the operator twice and waited for more than 15 minutes. No one came so I could not finish my shower :(. The bell boy was very careless. I personally told him to be careful with my CK bag. Not to put it on floor. When The bag is inside the room I noticed dust marks on the bag :( Food is good. Gym and swimming pool is good too. Other staff members were acceptable and one front office staff member was exceptional (Kanishka).,negative

"We travelled to this hotel with Kuoni travel under the idea that it was a 5* luxury hotel. This hotel had all the potential of a good 4* hotel. The beech was amazing the staff were amazing, however there always seemed to be something missing and not quality about the hotel. We stayed at this hotel for 7 nights having travelled around the island for 4-5 days. The poolside service was very good with staff being extremely friendly and chatty. The animator was also a healthy addition to the hotel encouraging water polo and other activates throughout the day. The pool bar offered a nice little lunchtime snack menu however every meal was with French fries and wasn’t the best quality. We recommend sprite as it was half the price of coke or diet coke. The sprite was around 70p and coke was £1.50 for a can. There was also a service charge on each bill so there was no need for tipping and carrying cash as it could all be charged to the room The evening food in the main restaurant under a set menu was very average and was trying to be to clever for its own good. Not much variety if you were a fussy eater and didn’t like fish. The al a carte restaurant (or coffee shop) offered a welcome opportunity to get a square meal. This was available with a 10% discount to half and full board customers. when the hotel got busy at the weekend however the restaurant came alive with a huge Mexican and bbq buffet on the Friday and Saturday nights. The breakfasts were also very good with every possible breakfast such as omelettes and waffles. However, when the weekend did arrive the hotel filled with hundreds of locals. This wasnt a problem until the quiet pool became a holiday at butlans with kids screaming and weeing into the pool. The locals were then extremely rude to the friendly staff making the stay extremely uncomfortable as you had to witness this behaviour. The staff were being shouted at and fingers clicked at with no manners. It was clear that the other guests felt the same through conversations in the lobby. The evening buffet at the weekend although it had good food resembled a school canteen. At 9 oclock families were bringing there young screaming children to dinner. Those children who were not dead on there feet at this time were runing around bumping in to the staff and other guests. This un civilised behaviour caused some couples to leave in disgust. The room was very good although we were continually being pested by staff asking if the room was ok. Also the wiring of the room was questionable with switches for different lights being in the wrong place. The beech was a no go area also as you were trying to have a romantic walk along the beech and were surrounded by peopel trying to sell you trips and clothing. Even when you were trying to sun bathe there was a constant noise coming from the beech of people trying to grab your attention. As a result of this I would not recommend this hotel to anyone I liked. I will also be informing Kuoni of the hotel at the weekend.",neutral
"The staff are so friendly, comfy rooms, superb pools, lovely beach and overall its a great hotel in a nice environment. The food was not that great and very less dessert varieties. The washroom in the day room has transparent glasses and broken mat curtains so it was quite uncomfortable with friends in the room. So we had to use the washroom with the lights off..",neutral
I just stayed one night in this hotel but for that night I enjoyed a lot and experienced one of the best service and hospitality from the staff also the rooms are very beautiful the food is delicious ... the pool faceing the sea is also fantastic and the green relaxing pool was my type.

"Well having had a long flight and a long drive I may have been slightly over tired but my first impressions of the hotel and the room was disappointment. It does come down to taste but I found the hotel is characterless. Our room was good but without the two extra beds for the children which was irritating as my husband had emailed the hotel directly confirming them but they were set up quickly and our request for table lamps in the lounge rather than overhead lighting met as quickly. The children loved the pools and I absolutely hated breakfast! It was enough to bring tears to your eyes the oppressive dining room the scrum around the breakfast bar seemingly at all times, the awful service. I had so many variations on getting a cup of earl grey they were green tea, warm milk, teabags and nothing else including water or a cup, they ran out of tea bags I supplied my own and then tea arriving 30 minutes later when you're just about to leave. In the land of bountiful fruit why are 3 out of 5 breakfast juices made from concentrate or nearer to cordial? Can they not default to 4 place servings, then if 2 come to breakfast they are happy and if 4 come down they are instantly satisified a win win rather than waiting 10 minutes for cutlery for 2 of the party. Can they not allocate a server to families staying longer than 3 nights thus establishing a rapport. Saying that the service elsewhere was fine. The food ranged from adequate to good. Amal's in Bentota was excellent for sea food and Refresh in Hikkaduwa(45 mins) had an enormous choice and was very good. The location was ok , Galle was an hour drive Bentota about 30 minutes. We did take some trips to Udawlawe 4 hours each way and Sinharaja 3 hours each way. As mentioned in previous reviews the beach is effectively out of bounds if you do not wish to be pursued by the local tour guides and hawkers. It could be a great hotel with adequate staff training to instill a sense of ownership and pride, a rethink of the decor, a complete overhaul of the main dining room practices, some investment in soft furnishings. Despite its short comings we thought the Heritance was good value for money.",negative
"I spent a holiday at Heritance with my friends. Best thing in the Heritance is pool which opens to the beach. Its an amazing view and really refreshing mind. the buffet had a variety of dishes and all are tasty. But I felt that the hotel has gone down in some areas such as maintenance. The major minus point is the unclean bathrooms, ponds and entrance. Overall a very enjoyable stay. Lovely service..",positive

"We checked in on New Year's eve to see 2012 in. We'd booked a triple room and paid a 50% advance at the head office at Aitken Sence Colombo, which was mandatory due to the New Year's eve rush. But the room was not ready at check- in and we had to wait quite awhile. We were given large half glasses (yeah half!) of a local fresh juice but realised later that other check in guests were given moist towels as well. Finally, we were taken into a 2 roomed suite that had been furnished for only two persons. We had to look for a room boy to tip him to bring in a third bed, third set of towels etc.etc. Our so-called luxury room was far from that - the 'fridge didn't work, the TV was badly tuned, the safety deposit locker malfunctioned, one bedside light didn't work.. Due to the malfunctioning fridge we were not even able to break a bottle of bubbly.. (now who likes warm champagne) - (BTW check the spelling of 'champagne' in the GM's letter of welcome - here my sex was wrong - I was titled as 'Mr' We had tipped the check-in steward - a name like Achila - do avoid this scoundrel at all costs! - generously to get us a table for the gala dinner, but he was nowhere to be seen. We looked into the area four times, to ensure that we had a table, but nothing had been set up for us. Finally, we were told to come down for dinner and that we would then get our table. No table when we arrived for dinner. We were then told to sit at another table. Five minutes later the same steward - named Mudalige - said he was sorry but the table had been booked by somebody else!!- I refused to get up! Our table had no lamp of decor etc like the other tables and after telling just about every waiter passing by, we got some of these things over 1 1/2 hours later!! The next day at breakfast, after standing in line for awhile, I requested a warm item from a serving chef, I was told by him that he had to serve over 50 guests at that time (so what?!). Finally, the time to depart arrived, and we breathed a sign of relief. We were all women but even the final receipt was titled 'Me & Mrs"". When I got to my car in the hotel car park I found parts of it strewn about - it had been damaged by a tour operator who had claimed that I had been blocking him! Now this was a clearly designated hotel parking space which should have been so designed not to inconvenienced other vehicles. The hotel couldn't even inform the person to remove my vehicle (they didn't even know the name or company of the vandal) because it keeps no records of guest vehicles - rather a security threat in a country just recovering from civil strife, methinks.... Having said this, the general manager and front office manager were extremely nice and tried to compensate for our traumatic experience by even offering us an extra night on the house, but we had to get back to our families on new years day - so we were given a discount on the room rate, cakes and chocolates to forget our troubles.. The room rate for this unforgettable experience was well over $ 400 and unforgettable experience it certainly was! It will be a loooong time before we recover from the trauma of our stay at Heritance Ahungalla. This is a hotel that needs to get its act together in terms of processes, quality checks and staff training. This is what we pay for when we buy a hotel experience. It is also what we pay for when the hotel is incompetent.",negative

"2/5 Poor service, poor rooms, and poor food quality. Particularly the food was bad. Unfortunately I included full board with my booking and I wish I didn’t. I advise you not to come here as you will definitely regret the experience particularly that there are lots more options in the area that are considerably far better. Off course the high end ones can’t be compared as well",negative
"After visiting Sri Lanka 4 times over the last 6 or 7 years visiting several different hotels, I have to say I wasn’t overly impressed with the Hotel. We stayed for a week in January and to be honest the hotel was ok, the staff were great and the setting beautiful. But I have to buck the trend of good reviews because to be honest the food was average at best. As mentioned above my wife and I have visited Sri Lanka many times without any issues. But unfortunately by the second night my wife and I came down with severe diarrhoea and stomach cramps which lasted the whole week. This could have only been the food or drink because we always drink bottled water. You also dont expect ongoing hotel maintenance in high season with mobile scaffold in the hotel entrance and around the front of the pool for 3 days. Seeing men with breathing equipment sending huge clouds of white smoke into the air in the courtyard outside our room. It was so bad we had to put a towel at the bottom of our door. All together if wasn’t for the setting and the staff it would have been a poor stay in a 5 star resort.",negative

"So we went to the hotel to celebrate my mom's birthday and it's truly an architectural masterpiece it's simple yet sooo elegant and beautiful. With this also comes the fact that the level of activities in the hotel are quite less (personally I'd prefer some music when I'm dining or just chilling in the pool area) The hotel gives a warm welcome and the level of hospitality is absolutely high. The lunch was delicious each and every dish was so tasty yet we were very disappointed with how the evening tea was presented ,yes we came for the day package yet there was no proper place in which it was given and there was no place to sit and I was quite worried about the amount of flies setting on the butter cake. Overall everything was absolutely perfect just that the evening tea was abit clumsy.",neutral
"We visited this hotel at the end of a group tour and were very disappointed with our accommodation. The other members of the group were given different quality rooms despite having paid the same and were mostly very happy but our room was unacceptable. ( I think from the website images it was a ‘deluxe’ room with partial sea view) The electrics in this part of the hotel were obviously in need of urgent renovation. Two of the plug sockets were damaged with melted plastic around the pin holes and the air conditioning would only work at all by fiddling with the slider switch on the wall and then went off again after a couple of minutes. We complained and a manager said they would sort out the plug sockets the next day but asserted that the air conditioning WAS working although obviously it was not and the room remained very warm. Apparently the hotel was fully booked and there was nothing he could do about it. I was online looking for alternative accommodation when the situation was resolved by our tour guide who generously swopped rooms with us and this room was lovely. Although the electrics were our main complaint, the room also smelled damp and was generally in need of renovation, not really five star. The rest of the hotel was very good and the restaurant was excellent so our experience was a great shame. (Although a word of caution re check out- all members of the group found that they had paid their bills in pounds with a poor exchange rate although the invoice was in rupees and nobody was asked about paying in sterling)",negative
"Great place to end our Holiday. Quality room, immaculate beach,outstanding service. F&B slightly expensive due to the taxes. However the buffet and breakfast spread were fantastic. Great work with chefs cooking hoppers and dosai. Particularly would like to thank the all day dining staff and manager who were fantastic. Special mention - Kumarasiri Salinda who was outstanding with all guests. He remembered names and what our son liked. The front office and porters are equally to be applauded. Great work and will see you next year. Would suggest fellow travelers to stay away from the beach hawkers.",positive
Good but could be better.,neutral
"The check in was very smooth. Was assigned to a room in the old wing which was very clean. The bathroom was very compact but did have one negative impact since it was party made out of glass and was covered with wooden blinds. This method is not very family friendly when it comes to privacy. The staff was very helpful when changing rooms when we were upgraded to a family suite which was ""AWESOME"" overlooking the GREEN POOL. As usual the Heritance Chain kept up to the standard when it came to the meals where you could find a massive variety and availability. However appreciate if activities for children and catered for since it was quite hard for us to keep the kids occupied and made it boring for them. All we could find was a GHOSTLY kids room. The beach was very clean, and was the only things which kept the children occupied other than the beach. Since the sea was a bit rough kid's couldn't get the full advantage. Last but not least I would like to bring up some thing, the only negative point is you must discuss at the time of check in about the child policy since I was asked about the ages of my kids at the time of check in (which were 6 & 11), in the end at the time of check out (mind you we had a Triple Full Board booking and prior read up of child policy of the hotel) were charged extra for the child, which I see is not professional. So it's advisable if you confirm prior to booking to avoid any unpleasant surprises.",neutral

The hotel needs a good clean from top to bottom. Except for the pool and bar area it is all pretty grubby eg. the coffee shop chair arms and tabletops are black with dirt. The floor in the hotel room was gritty and some of the linen was gray with dirt or age. Even the most basic accommodation we stayed at in Sri Lanka were better maintained than this. They seem to be cutting costs all round including not enough staff. One good point is the quality of the breakfast buffet which was very good.,neutral

"Terrible property, they have some audacity to call themselves a 5 Star",negative
"Our initial impression was that the hotel was ok but in need of some TLC but to be fair the rooms were kept clean and the general atmosphere made for a very pleasant holiday. General points you may like to note: - the Sri Lankan people are genuinely very friendly which to begin with can confuse westerners. - the beach sales people aren’t actually that troublesome (nor are the dogs) - both pools are lovely though the green pool has far fewer kids - we never had any difficulty actually getting sun beds, though not always were we wanted them and there was a shortage of umbrellas - Food flavours lovely though we personally found the meats tough on occasion. Truthfully food does get a bit same’y after 14 nights. Wine in our first week on the all inclusive package was ropey but seemed to be changed halfway though. People said there had been complaints. - There are 2 complimentary bottles of water in room each day and it is in plentiful supply. - there is 1 “British” electric socket in the room but the rest require an adapter. Wall mounted hair drier ok but nothing special. - mosquitoes are a nightmare - take loads of spray. If you are on a TUI all inclusive it maybe helpful to know: - wine is only included with lunch and dinner. Cocktails are ok but not great. Ask for bottled tonic. - you can eat in the other restaurants at additional cost but with a 15% discount. - some tours (e.g Kandy by train and whale watching) start at 4 or 4.30 in the morning! Which wasn’t pointed out when we booked it. We didn’t get back from Kandy until 9.45pm so a very long (if great) day. We’d also recommend the Madu Nature Tour. 1/2 day with a turtle release at the end - joyous! - upgrade flights if you get the chance. It’s about £250 per flight per person but is worth it in our opinion from the airport lounge to the slightly larger seats it adds to the holiday. To sum up we will return to Sri Lanka but not on an all inclusive basis ...",neutral

"We had 5 nights here with 3 adults and 2 kids. After a bit of a slow check in and having to swap rooms because of renos, we settled in and had a merry old time. Fab swimming pool and warm, friendly and very helpful staff. The food was terrific, we ate in all the restaurants in this hotel. The amazing team in the kitchen cooked us up some top seafood nosh. Loved the beach dining. There were a few niggling issues with a lack of hot water hot water and dodgy door locks but that aside I would not hesitate to recommend.

"I had the Heritance recommended from someone I know...clearly we have different taste or it was a different Heritance they stayed at. We booked this place for our last night in Sri Lanka as closer to Colombo and also looked lovely from the website. We so wished we had stayed at our gorgeous little boutique hotel in Mirissa instead! I won't make that mistake again...this is definitely a nice enough place for families or people looking for an all-in-one, resort experience, the beach is very pretty and so are the pools and lounge area with lots of grass and trees. Our room was OK but as many people say, 'tired' and not the cleanest ever, although a very good shower. The food, a buffet, was decent, but definitely nowhere near the food we had during our entire stay in Sri Lanka at a fraction of the cost. We had a hefty service charge added to our bill simply for ordering 1 bottle of wine at dinner! We booked a massage at the spa there which was good, and took advantage of the tennis courts. There are certainly plenty of facilities, but the various sales-people around selling tourist goods and palm readings made it that little bit more resorty/touristy for us. Overall, definitely not for the traveller who likes to stay less 'chainy' hotels (I was also enticed by their 'eco' claims but not sure I saw much to support it?) and I would not call it 5 star, but I probably made a mistake in booking it in the first place for what we wanted!",neutral

"Hotel caters for all needs. Food somewhat expensive as per many high end hotels in Sri Lanka. Look at prices and then add 25% for service charge , vat and city tax. The buffet dinner was a highlight for us and one of the best we have ever had. Chef Manjula produced a fabulous range of seafood options plus a wide variety of Sri Lankan and western dishes to suit all tastes. I love Sri Lankan dishes however the other 3 in our party not so much......we all agree it was one of the best buffets that we have experienced in our travels",positive
"I was there for two nights with two of my French friends (Tour Operators) The first impression on arrival was extremally good and the welcome was quite impressive even together with the General manager himself of the hotel. Well trained staff in every department and food served was too extraordinary and absolutely there was nothing to grumble... However as a five-star property, this hotel needs an immediate renovation pretty soon. The corridors and most of the other public places look very dull and gloomy. Whilst thanking the management for providing us luxury renovated rooms, we also noticed during the hotel visit that the non-renovated rooms too need an immediate upgrading to compete with the upcoming new properties nearby.

"Fantastic but would have been nearly perfect if there hadn't been a wild dog lose in the corridor howling and looking very threatening at 3am. It's nearly unavoidable to have them trying to get in close due to the wonderful open modernist architecture, but staff should be patrolling the open spaces at night much more regularly. My impression is that staff doesn't patrol these spaces at all at night. Also since it's not easy to get to a town for supplies, a small convenience store should be included, where you could buy personal items, like sunscreen, shaving cream, etc.",positive

We checked in on the first week of Oct. The check in staff was friendly and welcomed us with a refreshing drink. The room was spacious but we received two single beds for me and my husband. Which I found really ridiculous. They should have inquired regarding this when we made the reservation or at check in. When we asked to change they said the hotel was fully booked. We then asked the housekeeping to dress the beds with a single double bed sheet. Which still didn't make a big difference. The room fridge and the phone was not working. Informed them and they replaced it. The rooms need refurbishment and new equipment. The lunch buffet was not that great. The Srilankan option was good but the other dishes were not tasty. The starter section looked really pathetic. And added to that the prawns were not de-veined. Which was unacceptable. The waiting staff was dazed. We had to ask for water. Nobody escorted us to tables. The staff was basically a little lost. During dinner they had barbecue going on which was good. They had a seafood dish again the most prawns were not de - veined again. Brought it to the attention of the management and informed them that there could be consiquences for consuming non de - veined prawns. They apologised and offered to get something else. I informed them I don't need anything else but to keep the kitchen staff informed regarding this. Breakfast was good and tasty. Again during breakfast the waiting staff was lost. Asked for coffee and never got it. I just left it. The other complaint is to get more high chairs for kids to restaurant because our friends needed a high chair and everything was taken. So if the hotel is full there is no option. But I have to tell that hands down the best buffets to go to for is heritance Kandalama and Negombo. So tasty and great variety.,negative

"We were only here one night and arrived mid afternoon, so we were not able to get a very comprehensive view of the property. Check in procedure was very slow, albeit they do bring you a drink and snacks and invite you to sit………….and sit……….…..and sit…………..and just when I was about to get up and enquire what was taking so long, they finally invited us to go to our room. There WERE a few people who arrived at once, but it really did take some considerable time, for reasons not clear to me Check out was also somewhat slow, and then getting summoned to an office behind reception makes you wonder what is going on NOW ? Has my card been declined, my visa an irregularity, am I wanted for something ? Turns out it’s just the cashiers office ! So why not just accept payment at the front desk like every other hotel in the world ? Room was fairly large, comfortable, and of a good standard, with everything one expects from a resort hotel. I particularly liked the sliding shutters, as opposed to curtains. Cesar Ritz said about an hotel needing 3 things - “position, position and position” and this property certainly has position ! Located right on the wide sandy clean beach, (not sure if one can swim from it) warm infinity pool reaching towards the sea. Palm trees, lawns, shady trees around the pool area – it’s the epitome of a beach resort hotel ! It’s a fairly large property too. The standard tourist trap shops selling souvenirs, but I suppose that’s to be expected ! The dinner buffet was of a good standard, and it was very pleasant to be seated in the warm night outside under the palms, on a lawn adjacent the beach, with lanterns for lighting – all very Polynesian Island stuff ! Food was of a good standard, though I found the drinks service a little slow, and slow to follow up. Yes, they were busy with a lot of people, but I often have cause to question whether that is in fact an excuse or not ? In general it’s often about having sufficient and well trained staff, and quite often just about general organization. On the one hand the hotel has everything you would expect of a luxury beach resort hotel, and there is nothing to complain about as such, but for me there was just something slightly missing - it was all TOO standard luxury beach resort, like many others I have stayed in, and no real “wow” factor as such. I suppose it’s difficult to be a “different” beach resort, and perhaps I just stay in too many hotels, but these beach resorts all tend to have the same formula and once one has stayed in a few, they all sort of blend together in your mind – nothing truly memorable ! I had recurring thoughts of Monty Python’s “Package Tour Complaint” skit – go look it up if you aren’t familiar with it ! We would actually like to go back some time and spend a bit longer, as lazing around the pool with a drink was just what we needed at the end of a busy 3 week trip to India and Sri Lanka. In the end though we had a pleasant stay, and no real issues, and I therefore recommend it as a good place to spend a few days and relax !",neutral

"I recently visited Heritance with a group of friends after my wedding in Sri Lanka. We stayed there for 3 nights. The hotel itself was comfortable, with all the necessary amenities. The highlight was definitely the pool, which was great as the monsoon meant swimming in the beach wasn't possible. Another highlight was the quality of food at the dinner buffet which had great variety. The hotel has been there for a number of years and it turns out Aitken Spence (the company which owns the hotel) is opening another large hotel just down the road in the coming months. This may explain the ""tired"" state of Heritance as it seems like there hasn't been a lot of recent investments. Another disappointment was the lack of evening entertainment. Because Ahungalla itself is secluded with very little night life or day time options (compared to Hikkaduwa or Bentota) it was a shame that the night time activities were so limited. The only options we found were a tired lounge bar, and quiet pool side bar. When I compare it to other hotels in Bentota which had more live music and more bars it was disappointing.",neutral

"From the moment we arrived we were greeted with smiles and fantastic service. The level of service throughout the hotel was without exception first class. We stayed in a room overlooking the main swimming pool and also a suite, both of which were lovely. All of our wedding arrangements were taken care of seamlessly, and the whole experience of getting married abroad could not have been smoother. A special thanks has to go to Shanika Jayasekara who co-ordinated our wedding and was there throughout the day making sure everything went to plan. Shanika and Mawatte Mawanna both Executive Officers at the hotel kindly acted as witnesses on the day for which we were both very grateful. On the wedding day we had a tropical storm in the middle of the service, this meant we had to quickly re-locate to a covered area, this was done by many hands in little time, everyone very willing to make the best of the situation. This made a big difference to our day and eventually the sun came back out and we finished the service in the gardens of the hotel. Many thanks for making our wedding unforgettable.",positive

Thanks to all the staff.",positive
"This hotel was a bit of a disappointment, not the five star rating we were expecting. In our opinion this hotel needs to be downgraded to four star. Whilst there was some painting/maintenance work taking place while we were there, the hotel didn’t have that ‘luxurious’ five star feeling about it. Certainly comparing it to a five star rated hotel we stayed in whilst holidaying in Zanzibar 18 month's ago, it was definitely of a different class/standard. The fruit bowl, dressing gowns and slippers were not in our room when we arrived and there was no mention, when we checked in, of them arriving later. The cream rug was filthy (we rolled it up and put it under the bed) and that improved the look of the room immediately! On the plus side, the staff were extremely friendly and helpful and very responsive to our needs. On several occasions we only had one bath towel left instead of two which meant having to call house-keeping. Although immediately we called the second towel would rapidly appear, this isn't the level of service we would expect from a five star resort. The restaurant areas were nice and the food was good. We tended to eat in the coffee shop which also served as a restaurant which did some nice meals, we did eat occasionally in the buffet restaurant. The pool area is nice. The hotel is located on the beach, but most of the time the red flags are flying due to the under currents there. On most days despite the red flag flying people still went into the sea, if you went with caution you were fine, but there were occasions people got into difficulties and the life guard at the hotel had to come to their rescue. We enjoyed watching a wedding take place whilst there. We also had the experience of seeing one of the resident monitor lizards digging up and eating another monitor lizard’s eggs (13 in all!!!). We were lucky enough to see a turtle come ashore and lay her eggs on the beach before going back out to sea – wow what a wonderful experience. We also visited a turtle hatchery up the road, take a tuk tuk (it’s cheaper than a taxi) and if you want to experience putting baby turtles into the sea you need to go at dusk around 6.00 pm (in Feb). Before booking this hotel we were told we could go out of the hotel and that there were lots of eating places in the area, this is not the case. We were told not to go out of the resort at night, so that was also disappointing. Sadly there is no ‘all inclusive’ option here. In summary, this is a nice hotel, situated on a lovely beach, not five star luxury, but a nice four star. We were here celebrating my 50th birthday and wanted a bit of luxury after touring for 8 nights and in retrospect wish we had stayed at either The Jetwing Lighthouse or The Fortress in Galle.",neutral
"I couldn't agree more with the comments below. We stayed there from 26th December until after New Year. Had we been able to get a refund we would have moved out on day 1! Firstly, despite what their website says, all rooms do NOT have a sea view. We were given a room overlooking the tennis courts. After a huge discussion, they said that we could move to a lower category room - where a seaview was availabile - BUT they wouldn't refund us the £450 difference. After I pointed out that they were falsely advertising, the local agent out there agreed to pay for us to upgrade us to a luxury suite - however, the hotel really should have picked up this cost as their website was giving incorrect information! The suite was ok - but not worth the money they charge. Again, their website states luxury goods and free sparkling wine, fruit etc. None of those things materialised! The shower gel was provided in glass bottles which took forever to let the gel out. There was no conditioner, no bubble bath and the cotton buds were only supplied on the first day - all basic things for a 5 star hotel! The lighting is also totally illogical as the person states below. It's certainly not a luxury 5 star property. There's water aerobics in the pool every day - with loud techno music blaring out of the speakers. They had Karaoke in one bar and a very naff electronic keyboard player belting out songs like ""lady in red"" in the other. Not exclusive property that it claims to be! The sun loungers had dirty cushions - which didn't even cover the whole of the lounger - and there weren't enough for the number of guests. You were also shouted at by the hawkers from the beach - which really shouldn't happen at this type of property (I've stayed at lots in Sri Lanka and nowhere else is like that!) Finally, the food. It was very uninspiring for the cost. The upper restaurant was not open the whole time we were there - so the only a la carte menu available was from the coffee shop. I think it's an absolute disgrace to charge the money they do - I was incredibly misled and I too will be lodging a formal complaint. The only saving grace was the location - but frankly - there are lots of hotels in Sri Lanka with just as nice locations - minus the hawkers and at a much cheaper cost!",negative

It was a very warm welcome from the staff. And took so long time for checking process even though it was not a busy time. The room we received was not at the expected quality and filled with flyers. We had to request several times to remove flyers and finally we requested for new room since we were with an infant. Initially they rejected our request and I had to talk to FOM to get a new room. So until 6. 30 pm from the time we checked in (3.30pm). It was such a unpleasant experience. Other room services were all good. Restaurant services and foods was very good. Sleeping in the new room was a night Meare because of the noise came from ceiling. It seems that the room was just below a walking path or some steps.

But the main thing is that the ocean and a warm pool of 35 degrees are nearby and there are no water-motor modes of transport, a clean endless ocean Live music in the evening but not all musicians are good Requests to notice partially live music on compositions from the Internet were refused, so many evenings it was a bit boring. I don’t recommend using taxi drivers near the hotel reception, the prices are too high, it’s better to take a tuk tuk on the street+94 77 950 4156 Alim , you should also not leave things on the sunbeds in the evening, they took my swimming trunks this way, and you should be even more careful in the shops in a tent Opposite Rio, they didn’t want to give change, we had to threaten that we’d take away everything that was on the windows, then they returned it, I think I’ll come back here next time",neutral

Sadly disappointing and over rated 5 star,negative
We are a spoilt family when it comes to medium to luxury travels. Therefore this review is based on comparison of this hotel against many others in Sri Lanka. Our stay in this hotel was relaxing and welcoming. The rooms are comfortable and clean and the staff are super friendly. Whilst not the most demanding of customers we were made to feel like nothing was a bother to them. Attention to detail and care was taken by the staff. Special thanks to Dumindha who represented his hotel very well. Recommended. Note However this is not a hotel if you want to swim in the sea. Currents are incredibly strong and dangerous. Now for some points to improve: The hotel is looking tired and needs a modicum of renovation. The walkway floors and hallways can get very slippery when the rain comes in. It’s all open and is a hazard. The reception staff were eager to workout when we aim to checkout. They could tone that down.,neutral

"I am disappointed with Heritance,Ahungalla very much, for pick up taxi from the airport to the hotel did not appear in spite of calling and sending e-mail to request. Further worse, the hotel man said that this occasion had happened because I had not sent him confirmation e-mail and ordered me to call the taxi by myself when I telephoned him to help us with nervous at the air port. After all, I ordered him to arrange the taxi and my husband and I could reach the hotel by local uncomfortable taxi. When I arrived at the Hotel, he did not appear, and no one touched this situation. So I requested to meet him, but he did not appear. So I requested to meet the hotel manager, at last He appeared. He did not apology and insisted he had never received confirmation e-mail, but had done his best. So I showed him my mobile to prove sending him confirmation e-mail after 8 minute later his e-mail. He insisted that he had never received e-mail by showing me his mobile(perhaps he cut my confirmation e-mail)and at last unwillingly apologized me. This time, My husband sent e-mail to request the taxi~ no reply, then I sent e-mail~no reply. Then I telephoned to request taxi, and then received the e-mail with taxi fee and requesting confirmation reply, so I sent back shortly. Is Heritance Ahungalla good hotel? I have never meet such a rude and impolite hotel man like him. I sent my opinion to improve hotel by e-mail and left the hotel's questionnaire sheet, but I have not received anything.",negative

"Since we had already experienced the exceptional hospitality at Heritance Kandalama and The Sands at Kalutara (Aitken Spence properties), we booked our Christmas vacation at Heritance Ahungalla a couple of months back to avoid disappointment. When we arrived at the property we were pleasantly surprised to find out that we had been upgraded to the Luxury Suite with the garden balcony. The Suite (room 324) was HUGE compared to a regular room, in fact if I am not mistaken, the bathroom of the suite probably had the same square footage as a regular room, with a 2 person bathtub, a shower stall, double sinks and a huge walk in closet. The suite was richly appointed with real furniture including a small library. My 13yr old was thrilled to find an age appropriate book by Rick Riordan that she had not previously read. The bedroom had a comfortable king sized Four Poster bed and a recliner. Mini fridge, TV, surround sound system and tea/coffee service rounded off the comforts. Food was excellent as this hotel's chefs had emerged as the Most Outstanding Culinary Team in Sri Lanka after competing against both international and domestic star-class city and resort hotels at the 15th Culinary Art Competition. Sous chef Roshan Pujitha was kind enough to show us some of the culinary masterpieces and their chocolate factory. Most nights were theme nights, and on the night where they served Chinese food, we were prepared to order A la Carte for our daughter who has nut allergies, but the server quickly brought her a plate of Lasagna from another restaurant at no extra charge. the wait staff was attentive and responded to our requests in a timely manner. The rooms were clean and well stocked with fresh towels, bath robes and bottled water. The room steward came every evening to make sure we had fresh towels and to turn down the beds. Fresh fruit was also delivered to the room. The only issue we had was, we wanted the vacation over Christmas, but we were told that the hotel was booked solid. This was not the case as there were plenty of vacant rooms available. This was a bit of a disappointment since we really wanted to be away during Christmas. It was a pleasant surprise to meet Ms Niranjala the hostess, who was also at Heritance Kandalama during our visit to that property in August, and she recognized us and came over to chat. It was an enjoyable experience and a great vacation.",neutral

Select a room on the level one if you love the view of the ocean and catch breathtaking views of the sun set from your private balcony. A slight drawback is towards the 2nd half if the day your room could get a bit warm but if you are coming from a colder climate this too will be a welcome feature.,positive
"My first impression as I drove into the driveway and into reception was quite good....then downhill.I picked the hotel as it was ranked a 5 star property,but by European I would give it a low 3.....I was in a luxury room...half the lights did not work,a damp smell lingered despite spraying,the room was old dated the shower over spilled and the water was not warm....I have to say the worst room I have slept in.The public areas and dinning room pool area also very dated.I was informed the hotel was closing in May 2016 for a full re fit....avoid until then....The staff need service training ...I found them lacking direction ....overall totally disappointed.",negative

"My wife and I spent the last two weeks of January here. The hotel is very nice, clean and the staff are attentive and helpful. The food in the buffet restaurant was OK.... nothing too special, but they try to cater for all tastes. We booked B&B only as we prefer not to be 'tied' to the same place for meals. However, outside the hotel, there is little choice along the beach. Only the 'sunshine bar' at the far Right as you look at the sea. The food there is simple, but very good and very reasonable. We eat at the 'Mustard' restaurant as well as the 'Fine Dining' restaurant that is within the hotel grounds. The food at both was very good, but because most of the guests were 'All Inclusive' and eat at the buffet, we dined alone in the other restaurants. I did have a bit of an issue with one of the 'room boys' though. The one we had at the start of our holiday was very attentive and made sure he told us each day that 'he was our room boy' (obviously after a tip at the end of the holiday). But he disappeared halfway through our time there. So, when we finally came to pack our bags, we gave our tip to the room boy that took over. However, as we walked with our cases to the lift, we were approached by the original room boy who made it obvious that he wanted a tip also. But we had already given our last Rupees away, so had nothing left. It was a cringingly embarrassing moment, which I didn't feel we should have been put in. I've seen comments here about the 'beach sellers' ... Our experience was nothing but good. I got friendly with a middle aged man called Pathmi, (usually wears a Red baseball cap and carries a Red Sri-Lanka tourism bag) He took me and his Nephew on a fishing trip in the mangroves. It was great. He also invited me back to his house, where his wife had cooked a 1.5kilo fish, potatoes, rice and curry sauce for lunch.... It was a real honour to go into his house as well as humbling..... So please look out for him on the beach. He's a real 'find'! If you are looking for a hotel that can provide good, clean accommodation, as well as good food and are happy to more or less stay around the hotel/beach area... this is a great place! If you are looking for a hotel, but would like to walk along the beach to find different restaurants, then look again. There's none there! (apart from 1)",positive

"My wife and I had a two week holiday here in December. Weather was good and we did trips to Yala National Park (4 hours by car) and Kandy (4 hours by car). I list below the positives and the negatives of our holiday. Positives : Good food in restaurant buffet with a different daily menu. Friendly and generally helpful staff throughout the hotel. Excellent sea view from our first floor bedroom balcony. Excellent sea front location offering lovely beach walks. Two very large and spacious swimming pools kept clean. Room very clean and some wonderful animal shaped towels kept us amused. International plug sockets, always a help. Good size balcony. Much needed cold drinks upon arrival. Clean sheets and towels daily. Large 50"" TV in bedroom. (A negative for us as we don't watch TV but probably a positive for others). Plenty of colourful bird life in the hotel grounds. And so to the negatives. No Jacuzzi for our entire stay. When we enquired we were told they were waiting for a part but by the time we left the Jacuzzi was looking very grubby with gathered dropped leaves and rainwater. Alcoholic drinks were expensive particularly a small glass of wine with dinner. Costly alcoholic drinks turned up very quickly at dinner but not the free water. On several occasions I had to ask three times for water. Lack of local railway train information at reception. No postcards sold at the hotel. We had air conditioning problems in our room which took a while to resolve. The plug in the wash basin didn't operate properly. No curtain in the bathroom for the first three days of our stay. Wobbly fan on the ceiling (maybe it was meant to be like that !). Wobbly bedside table definitely shouldn't be like that. Nowhere to walk to / have a coffee/beer/snack out the front of the hotel (busy road). That's even if you manage to get past the tour guides who hover by the hotel gates. Lack of lighting at night between the hotel front and the hotel gates. Insufficient staff in the restaurant when busy. This was particularly noticeable at weekends. Noisy building work being carried out on one wing of the hotel during the day. Some of these points might seem petty but added together it wasn't the holiday my wife and I had hoped for. Would definitely recommend Yala National Park. A visit to a Turtle hatchery. The Botanical gardens at Kandy. The fort at Galle .",neutral

An absolute disappointment,negative
"Having spent 8 days braving the roads of Sri Lanka touring their cultural triangle, we arrived at this hotel looking forward to a lovely rest for 7 days and we were not disappointed. This hotel is right on the beach and there is very little around it. It is for this reason that we went half board. A good decision is some respects as there is only one other bar 500 Metres up the beach along with a beach shack. The food at the beach bar was fine and considerably cheaper than the hotel should you be buying on a day to day basis. We often walked to the beach shack at a lunchtime for a beer (300 rupees and considerably larger than that offered by the hotel for 600R). The hotel, in effect has three restaurants. The buffet, the fine dining and the fish restaurant. If you are all inclusive or ½ board you can use the buffet (drinks are extra) but if you choose to use the other two you have to pay. We did not use the fine dining but the food looked good. We did use the fish restaurant on my birthday and it was a pleasant change to the buffet. The surrounding are not particularly appealing, the table and stools not comfortable. Because it was my birthday they had prepared a lovely table for me and provided ‘proper’ chairs making for a much more comfortable experience. The fish was fresh and delicious and went well with the white wine we had ordered. Because Sri Lanka does not produce wine, it is imported and so by locals standards, quite expensive, but no more so that what we pay in the UK. I do feel that the hotel could offer a discount at these two restaurants if you had paid for ½ board or all inclusive but chose not to use the buffet The buffet has a large selection of food on offer and so if you were just using the one hotel for your stay in this country a great way to try the curries that seem to make up the staple diet. (You can even have curry for breakfast). There was considerably more than curry though raging from salads (all cleaned in bottled water), soups to fish and meats. The range of sweets was very good and finished the meal off nicely. My criticism is that perhaps there is too much choice with the main course and as a consequence the food was on the whole not that hot and it was definitely quantity over quality. I cannot say the food was bad, but in my experience it was no more than average. I have certainly eaten a lot better around the world. Breakfast was once again a buffet with a very good selection or hot food and pastries and continental. In my opinion a better experience than the dinner. Turning to the rooms. We were first given a room on the second floor (they use the American system so no ground floor (1)) with a sea view. Number 229. Ok there were some trees in the way so perhaps sea glimpses would be more appropriate, but that did not distract from the fact that we could see and hear it. The room was not that far from the reception but we were told it was a quiet room. It was very ‘tired’ with the decor needing to be updated. At around 9pm we could hear the singer in the bar and also people arriving in reception. The music went onto 11:00 by which time i had been to reception to arrange to move. This was the only major complaint I have as the man on the desk first told me the hotel was full and then looked at his watch as if it was relatively early and made me feel that it was my fault that at 10pm I wanted to get to bed. After not accepting the excuse that it was full they arranged for us to move further along the corridor to the far end of the hotel, well away from the bar and reception the following day. This was in the same design room but one that had been decorated and refurbished. This had been done to a high standard and was very comfortable. We had this for free but they do charge $20 a night for the privilege of having a room that has been refurbished. We were told that the original rooms had not been decorated in 32 years. The room was cleaned daily sheets and towels changed. In the evening housekeeping came round to see if everything is ok and if you needed anything. I think at this point I need to say that all the staff were always friendly, polite and willing to help. Nothing seemed too much effort for them. I cannot praise the staff enough and they certainly make your stay enjoyable. There are two pools, the infinity pool that you see as you arrive at reception, and another in the grounds that whilst not infinity is big enough to swim/cool off and is far less crowded, by far the better choice in my opinion. There are more than enough sun beds, but as at most resorts there are some that insist on putting their towels on the beds that they consider their own for the duration of their stay. If you are prepared to tip the pool attendants, as some did, they will put towels on the beds for you, as they set them up early in the morning If you have a bed by the perimeter you do get hawkers that are in the grounds of the hotel, but stay on the perimeter trying to sell you trousers and sarongs (my wife bought two pairs of trousers at a shop on our travels for 500R whilst the hawkers wanted 2000R for one pair!) I am told that the hotel intend to keep them out of the grounds in the near future. I am aware that this seems a bit negative, not something that I intended as i wanted to give constructive criticism and to make it informative for those considering booking this hotel. I would have no hesitation in booking this hotel. The new rooms are lovely, the ground beautiful (watch out for the little tree squirrels and the small Iguanas) that are lovely to see. Of course in conclusion I reiterate that staff is amongst the best I have encountered and make this hotel what it is.",neutral

"We visited Heritance Ahungalla recently and observed some pros and cons that might be useful to point out. Pros. 1. As the room was booked as a part of our anniversary, we were given the most spacious room of the category and really loved every bit of it. It was cozy and relaxing. Our favorite part was how it seemed to be a sort of a separate building to the main hotel and opened up to the jacuzzi and resident green pool. 2. The hotel in general was very relaxing and spacious and never felt like it was crowded. well probably because it wasnt! but either way even if there was a heavy crowd it felt like you had your own space. Cons. 1. TV - Ofcourse you dont come on a holiday to watch TV BUT it would be great to have a few good options. The cable tv had very few channels excluding some of the most entertaining movie and tv show channels which I thought was a bit of a bummer. 2. The food was not great and not bad. Average I must say. We expected a large spread but it seemed that since it was off peak season and less crowd also because it was a weekday, there was very little variety and thereby ""threw a dagger"" to our expectations. Anyway Thanks Heritance for the nice stay and we hope to see you again sometime!",positive
"An awful lot of the people complaining about this hotel are moaning that it 'isn't five star'. As I recall, until fairly recently, a hotel in the UK had to have a Corby Trouser Press in the room to gain that vital fifth star. So maybe people are taking their view of '5 star' from the UK and, if they are then they are probably right - it isn't UK 5 star. But if it was you'd be paying a hell of a lot more than £150/night for it. It is, by any measure a stunning hotel. Cleverly designed by Geoffrey Bawa this low rise hotel (ground floor and two floors above) is laid out to create a series of separate spaces that never seem crowded (they only have just over 100 rooms). The setting, right on the beach, is terrific and the two giant pools are a delight. Those people giving it a poor review also complain that it is 'tired'. It would hardly be surprising given the fight against the elements that must be waged to maintain it but I can't agree. The grounds are imaculate and, yes some of the corridors are showing their age but the spacious rooms are absolutely fine. I've also found the staff to be gracious, charming and attentive. Most Sri Lankans are but here they definitely go the extra kilometre. And you can't fault the food, especially the buffet breakfast which will set you up for the entire day. The buffet supper is also excellent with a cornucopia of choice and a good selection of wines. Don't believe the nay sayers, there's nothing wrong with this hotel.",negative
Ok stay,neutral
"The hotel is old but well maintained. Garden is wonderful and night lighting also. With regards to the food and beverage, the buffet is ok without any plus. The chefs are very helpful. Buffet conditions are poor, chafing dishes are broken, salad buffet is basic. The Sri Lankan corner is quiet repetitive. Breakfast was up to standard, except the scrambled eggs. Service during breakfast needs to be looked after, as we waited 10 minutes before we were asked for our beverages. Pool bar : Beverage choice ok, but service is not a 5 star and cocktails quality is not up to what expected. Check in was very long but friendly and professional. One major point that the management needs to tackle is the beach boys and all souvenir boys that literally bother you once you go on the beach. Over all good stay, but certainly not at 5 star level. The hotel is extremely overpriced.",neutral

"Some of the facilities were pretty good, like the pool, proximity to beach etc however the rooms were very dated for a supposed 5 star resort. The staff were generally ok but check in and check out was ridiculously slow to where we were running half an hour late for our transfer on check out due to the pace in which the staff conducted themselves.

"The service was exceptional in this hotel - hence I am starting off by mentioning this - everyone was so friendly and went out of their way to be welcoming. In fact this is the main reason we would return to this hotel. The rooms were fine - we stayed on the 3rd floor and they gave us a nice basket of fruit,biscuits and peanuts to welcome us. I thought dinner was average but nevertheless enjoyable; breakfast was lovely. It is more of a family hotel/ older couple hotel and I think the entertainment is geared to that audience. For the price this hotel is amazing. Another thing worth mentioning is this hotel seems to do a lot for its local community which I think is fantastic - there was an ad for a charity it supports in the lift. I also did wonder if the hotel endorsed the beach sellers - some people probably find the beach sellers a bit annoying but actually if you just tell them you are not interested they leave you alone. These people are just making a living and if I can help them by buying from them I am happy to do so.",positive
"I thought the ""fine dining"" restaurant was disappointing and over-priced. The hotel felt too ""Buckland's Holiday Camp"" for me. Couldn't wait to leave each day on other activities outside the hotel. It looked to me also that the original building design had been messed with. The model airplane at the end of the 'infinity"" pool was ridiculous. Surely Geofrey bawa would not have approved.",negative

"Well The overall experience is not bad.. The two Pools were clean, big and had a good time swimming.. But the Jacuzzi pools were not clean.. Was very unpleasant to get in.. staff is friendly and supportive, except the staff in the buffet area.. Its like they are annoyed with the guests who are dining there.. One girl poured water to the glass until its over flowed.. She apologised but ddnt have enough time to clean it for us she got occupied with something else.. I dont blame her, But the hotel management becauae it seemed like they were over worked the shifts.. Some of them were exhausted and unable to provide the service as expected by the guests paid for a pleasant dining time.. Poor service from taking away the finished plates to filling up the finished dishes.. Buffet was average in my opinion, food is good, considerable amount of variety was there.. but i hope they can improve a lil bit more when it comes to buffet and dining.. Apart from that the stay was satisfying.. We booked a premium delux room.. Which was spacious and clean.. But the bed was uncomfortable.. I expected for the bathrooms to be cleaner and more pleasant looking for a five start hotel.. Heard complaints from the guests in deluxe rooms.. So make sure to book higher rooms.. I recommend this hotel for a get away with avarage expectations.. Surely not upto five star standards specially compared to herritance kandalama.. The reception staff was very nice.. The check in was easy and quick.. Beach was clean.. Place is quiet and peaceful.. Just some improvements are needed to keep up the five star standards..",neutral

A special shout out to our room guy Rukmal! I’ve stayed in plenty of hotels around the world but I can’t remember any as being so attentive to detail as Rukmal is. Everyday he makes me smile with the way he has dressed the room with flowers, nice cushions and the towel art is another level… He’s such a warm, happy, hard working guy. Also want to give special mention to two guys have made our trip incredible. Lilanga and Nipun - they have catered for our every wish and whim. We set them a challenge of getting us some vintage champagne so we could celebrate something special and the scoured the whole of the island, rang every hotel and managed to find two bottles of vintage Dom Perignon for us before we left. They really have pulled out all the stops to make our stay so memorable. They made sure all our dining has been spectacular by setting up a gorgeous table on the beach, three nights consecutively. I can’t heap enough praise on them enough. I’m so glad we got to know these guys, and that should be a little tip for other travellers. The hospitality industry has taken a battered since Covid and the staff work so hard by trying to make every guest feel exceptional. I always like to show my appreciation by learning everyone’s name, giving them my time, conversation and a few words of encouragement - it really does go along way and it will make your time here go from great to excellent. You can move mountains with guys like Rukmal, Lilanga and Nipun on your team. They are an absolute credit to the hotel and the Heritance brand should know what assets they have working for them. The hotel is beach fronted large and comfortable. Both pools is absolutely huge and so warm and welcoming. The food has been wonderful and the evenings we have spent on the beach, dining by the waves have been exceptional. But everything is down to the staff here. Worth 10 stars just for them!",positive

I stayed at Heritance for the weekend with 14 family members. It's a nice beach hotel with two large pools. The Sri Lankan food is really good and the staff is very friendly and always willing to go the extra mile to make guests happy. Praveen did an excellent job making sure we had everything we needed during all our meals at the hotel. We have stayed here many times before and will be back again.,positive
"Our last visit to this wonderful hotel was in 2022. We have also been coming since the early 2000’s too. We had a very nice suite on the 3rd level, overlooking the main pool and near the main restaurant. Despite the rainy weather and rough seas in October, we had a great time. Food (as buffet menu) was fantastic, staff were very helpful. Any little issues we’re dealt with professionally and quickly. We would like to thank all the staff we had contact with. Special thanks go to Ms Jayaru in Customer Relations, Chaminda in housekeeping, Ms Hasini and Duminda (who remembered us from 2022) in the main restaurant. They were able to reserve a table by the window we liked. A very enjoyable stay and a place we would recommend.",positive
"Heritance Ahungalla is not by UK standards a 4,5 star hotel but it was a nice hotel. There is a good selection of restaurants from buffet, café style, fine dining to an outdoor grill and all was off fantastic quality. We went for the B&B option and it worked out we spent about £28pp per day for lunch, dinner and a couple of drinks ( even had lobster one night!) The rooms are a good size however we found the linen and towels to often be dirty. Unfortunately we also had a small amount of money stolen by the cleaning staff. The location is perfect if you want a hotel that is more isolated but for us it was a little quite. During the monsoon session the sea was too rough to swim in so you are limited to sitting by and swimming in the pools.",neutral
The main Buffet restaruant is not too good. Lunch is over priced and lacks variety. Breakfast is a repeat of same items every day. The location makes it difficult to dine outside the restaurant.,negative

"We decided to stay at Heritance Ahungalla during our recent trip to Sri Lanka for two reasons... 1. The taj At bentota was under renovation and 2. People generally had good things to say about it. However our experience was OK. Rooms- they are clean, decent size, comfortable beds...but they were somehow a little dull.. Otherwise the rooms were quite clean and the housekeeping generally was good. We had a beautiful view of the sea from the room Food was expensive in the fine dining restaurants.. Buffet and coffee shop were ok though. We didn't quite like the dinner buffet, the breakfast buffet was decent. Overall hotel is ok. When you enter the lobby you don't feel that this is a luxury property. Though it's clean it's really minimalistic. They say it's the geoffery bawa minimalistic design and I personally prefer less to more but This place was actually quite bare. The pool however is very picturesque,,,and very clean. The main disappointment however was the beach. The beach actually was ok .. clean and all but the ocean floor was not a gentle sloping floor like in bentota near taj. It's some thing like it will be 3 feet deep ten feet from the beach and then 1 foot deep when you go further. S it was quite scary for a non swimmer like me as I was not prepared for the sudden drop in the ocean floor. The service overall was good and very courteous. However, the fact that the housekeeping staff barges into your room once u call for a check out was something I Didn't appreciate and thought it was very rude. They knock once and use their key to enter to check the minibar. They don't hv the decency to wait till we open the door or ask them to come in. The other staff was very good. There were a lot of children at the resort and the staff was very patient with all the kids who were almost wrecking their Christmas trees and running around the buffet place like crazy",neutral

"We arrived at the Heritance Ahungalla at 9pm yesterday evening after a long journey from the States. We were told that the rooms we had booked and paid for were no longer available. This is a small boutique style hotel. They solution was to send us next door to a large all inclusive party resort We contacted Agoda who booked the room and failed to notify us it was cancelled. They offered a 15% discount. Big deal, we had already lost our first day of a three day visit getting bounced around and treated like a bad disease. Escalation within Agoda was requested but ignored. Instead we got an email congratulating themselves on how well they did resolving our issue. Heritance management were worse and could only blame Agoda for not telling us they would not honour a fully paid reservation. Bottom line, do not trust doing business with these two shysters.",negative

"Stayed here in January with family. Set amongst beautiful pools and gardens on the beach, this hotel has huge potential. This was our second stay here and felt service and maintenance of the property had slipped considerably. Room are large and well equipped though a little bit dated. The pool and gardens are kept well however buildings were in a need of paint and maintenance. The service and food in the main restaurant were the worst we experienced throughout our stay travelling throughout Sri lanka. Breakfast was a good spread with plenty of variety, getting a cup of coffee took time though, sadly dinner was the worst experience we have had through our travels, the food was just slapped on, we were there for three nights and for two of the three nights we encounted empty dishes when we were serving and this was not replaced for a considerable amount of time, there was more emphasis on western dishes and sadly not much choice. We found service to be very slow, dishes were not picked up when one had finished their meals and staff were not every efficient compared to all the other resorts we have stayed in and we did choose this hotel given the positive feed back that was left on past experience. Sadly we didnt think much of this hotel at all.",negative

"The hotel was right on the beach, gated and setback from the main street.with numerous restaurants to choose from. We found the coffee shop lobster more superior to the fine dining restaurant experience. Great buffet breakfast-try the hoppers. The gym was the only disappointment with 2 walking machines and one permanently broken. Pools were great but ocean too wild to swim due to monsoon rains that came and went. The spa was average-reasonable prices but service disappointing. We went to the turtle farm nearby and other day trips are possible. If this is your last night I would suggest going further towards Colombo and staying at Mt Lavinia Hotel which is closer to the airport.",neutral

Six years later... We went back to Heritance,negative
"The location: Pleasant drive from Colombo.Beautiful , tranquil entrance. But the feeling did not last so long as it was a pain to check in. So many forms to fill and signatures, 4 separate ID documents for the 4 rooms. I would suggest the guest relation takes care of the forms instead of requesting the guest to fill it.Different ID docs per room, different signatures!!!! Absolutely ZERO CHILL!!! The rooms :Drab & dated in stark contrast to fond memories i had, visiting this establishment few years ago The food:Good variety , delicious & living up to Heritance standards Service: There were a few attentive staff.But had some bad experiences. My mother had a cramp (after swimming in that gorgeous pool) and requested some warm salt water brought in late night(10pm) .It took more than 30 mins for it to arrive .I wonder how long it would have taken to get a meal to a room. Dogded that bullet!! I feel like the new property next door must have poached best service personnel from here.",negative
"First of the good: The people and the rooms are great. Very helpful and kind staff. Rooms have a great view. The bad: Co-ordination of our trip was very poor. We got in very late and realized that they only booked us in 1 room when our reservation said 2 rooms. They ended up finding a room for my wife and I, but it had 2 twin beds rather than a king/queen. Same goes for my parents room. Food: Food was average at best. At a 5 (or 4 star) property, you expect the food to be excellent as you end up spending a lot of time just hanging out at the property rather than running around from place to place. Us being vegetarians was especially hard. We had the same 3-4 dishes to pick from. Most of them even seemed to be served from the meal before. The chef told us that we should have informed them of our dietary restrictions. However, from a 5 star resort, you expect them to follow up with you prior to your visit or during reservation, asking you of these things. Nothing of the sort happened. Of course, if they had followed up prior, the mix up with the room would not have happened either. In addition, if they followed up, they would've known that my father is disabled and would have found a room closer to the elevator.... I can't really recommend this property for the price we paid.",neutral

リゾート自体は重厚でゆとりのある造りになっており、大きなプールや開放感溢れるダイニングエリアでは快適に過ごすことができました。またリゾートから続く広い砂浜とそこに沈む夕日の景色は特筆物です。ただ、ホテルを一歩出るとそこは雑多で空気の悪い喧騒地帯。陸側も海側もしつこい物売りと客引きだらけで多少のストレスを感じることは否めません。食事は悪くないですが、外で気軽に食べ歩きがてきないことを考えるとバリエーションが少なすぎる。。。大きな街からもかなり離れているので不便を感じるかも。価格に対して環境面やソフト面が見合ってない印象は否めませんでした。,neutral

"Maybe our expectations were different, but we didn’t get what we were hoping for with our three-day stgay at the Heritance Ahungalla. We thought that an all-inclusive resort would be a relaxing base of operations but found that we were pretty much sequestered on the property. We wanted to get out and about during the day or night and the operation and setting did not lend themselves to that – the Heritance wants to capture all of your money during your visit. Rooms were clean and nicely appointed but small. High premiums for everything, from bottled water to laundry to room service to internet. Food options were limited and consistently underwhelming. Front desk and concierge staff were not particularly helpful when we did ask for suggestions for activities or dining off of the property. Should we find ourselves back on the coast in Sri Lanka we will look for a smaller hotel closer to one of the towns or villages, not an all-inclusive resort.",neutral
"Overnight on tour. They said it was five stars, but there was no toothbrush or slippers. Shampoo is contained in a ceramic container, making it difficult to use. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, the location is great! The food buffet is not so different from other hotels. The staff are kind. Finally, after I went on a hotel tour, they took my phone away from me because it was a survey. I logged into Google without permission and the hotel staff ticked all the good ratings. The receptionist female staff had asked us to only include comments, but the male staff were surprised when they closed the box and returned without comment after checking all the good boxes. It was an incident that made me think you didn't know what you were doing or you were mocking me.",negative
"Red ants everywhere. In the room, in the bathroom. Even got into our luggage. The lobby is gorgeous but the room was full of sand. Not sure if they forgot to mop our room but it was very sandy. Food was not very impressive either. The one positive thing was that the hotel staff were very helpful after our son got sick in the restaurant. I am grateful for that. This hotel used to be wonderful. This trip however was sub par. Not sure we will be back.",negative
"It took us 5 hours in a minibus to arrive to the hotel from Colombo (120 km trip) and few attempts to move to a less moldy room (the rooms are nice and people are very friendly). You quickly realize you’ll be facing the same menu for 8 days at the same restaurant (there is nothing around, and don’t be fooled by hotel “choices” – none was available). The beach is unapproachable – even when the waves and the weather cooperate (July is Monsoon season for the west side of the island) beach vendors would not go away. If you plan trips to other parts of Sri Lanka, well, think again. Getting anywhere from Ahungalla takes many hours by train or bus (we were hoping to visit Kandy which turned out to be 7 to 8 hours trip!). In short, there is absolutely no need to travel all the way to Sri Lanka to be locked in a hotel with no options, no usable beach, and nowhere to visit.",negative

"The stunning view beach is the only positive memory that we have from our stay. Otherwise the hotel is dated, poorly managed, and many unmaintained facilities. Air conditioning, ceiling fan in our room did not work. The door locks in our room to the bathroom and balcony were broken. Considering that balconies from other rooms are essentially interconnected, there was little or no security from the balcony side of our room. The main restaurant buffet is expensive and of poor cafeteria style food. Very little flair to the food, designed to please those who did not really want to leave home. Entertainment in the lobby at night is essentially Karaoke musicians mouthing CD music. The hotel was built in the 1960s and it seems nothing was done to improve or redecorate the place since it's initial opening. It is a nice visit back to a mid 1960's contemporary architecture that has a seedy ambiance. The staff is friendly and helpful as long as it does not involve complicated activities such as room maintenance, directions to anywhere, or being served coffee in the restaurants. The hotel has no control over the touts in front of the hotel nor at the beach. These touts are of course part of the scenery but makes the guests not want to wander onto the beach since they will not leave visitors alone and will not take no as an answer. It is a sad commentary of Sri Lanka, but the hotel could do more to discourage these parasites.",negative

"This magnificently designed hotel is a few hours north of Galle, on the sea. Like other great Sri Lankan hotels the foyer/reception area is open so there is a wonderful, gentle sea breeze cooling the reception area even on the hotest day. There are 2 separate pools, both clean, and beautifully maintained. There is a huge tree ocer one them providing natural shade. The rooms are spacious and very clean. The buffet is plentiful but you can also order a la carte in a separate area of the dining room. The breakfast is excellent - so many choices. I had the best omelette I had on my trip (and I a few good ones). As in other Heritance hotels in Sri Lanka, the staff are welcoming, polite and honest. You're on the beach - but you can't swim as there's a dangerous rip. But, oh well, the pool's pretty nice anyway. You can always go for a walk on the beach instead. It felt so luxurious and its actually very reasonably priced.",positive
My husband and I have just spent a week at the Heritance Ahungalla. The hotel it's self is very tired and needs a full refurb this is mostly evident in the main dinning resturant and pool side. The hotel needs to deal with the beach traders who make it very difficult to take a walk along the beach. With regard to the staff this was by far the redeeming aspect of our trip as every member of staff we dealt with we're exceptional. The food also cooked by the chefs in the fine dinning was also second to none and you would find it hard to eat a more tender fillet steak or rack of lamb.,neutral

"I travelled alone did a 5 day tour and ended at this hotel on the beach, the staff were amazing so thoughtful and friendly, Rooms were spacious and comfortable.The restaurant was closed for redecoration, so breakfast was in the conference room, as there were not many people staying, it was not that nice and told Mr KK, I asked if breakfast could be served outside by the pool, as this was far more attractive, he said it was not possible, the next day the buffet was outside by the pool, well done to Mr KK and his team keep up the good work",neutral
Having travelled to every continent in the world id say - The hotel is a 4star property Mr. Pahan at reception was the friendliest face whose smile calmed me many a times Beware of house cleaning who on three occasions walked in the room unannounced Due to the climate the buffet area have a lot of fruit flies over the food at fruit and salad counter which is disgusting Not many options for alacarte so best is to take a full board package If ur a light eater then half board is good Best part of food is the sri lankan cuisine Pool is amazing and beach is untouched which are the two features i loved most Overall de-stressing and relaxing Will definitely go back hoping for a better experience Used the spa which was average - they could do better with the massage and ambience Oh yes and pls carry shampoo and shower gel as the provisions at the hotel not user friendly - Globe trotter Ms Dsilva R,negative

"The hotel is generally good. I was informed that it had been hit by the tsunami in 2004 and all the ground floor rooms were submerged. I travelled in a group and somehow got upgraded to a large deluxe room which was fantastics with all the trimmings. The room was spacious with a great view. However, my friends who were in standards rooms didn't like their stay at all. They complained about the rooms having flying cockroaches. The culinary experience was not as great as I hoped considering the hotel was voted as being the Best in Culinary Experience in Sri Lanka. Maybe because I was comparing with Hilton Colombo where I had just come from and which I would rate as better. The gym was ok but the electic equipment such as treadmills and cross trainers could use an upgrade. The gym is open throughout i.e. it's never locked which is great for flexibility. The swimming pools are very inviting and the meeting room were provided was ok though the selection of coffee/ tea beak snacks could be improved. One thing that was interesting was the sea was rough all the time throughout our stay. No guests could swim in the sea at all. This is a very interesting phenomenon which i had not previously experienced.",neutral
From first arriving at the hotel we were greeted with friendly faces and the staff could not have been more helpful. The food was first class and although some of the bedroom furniture probably needed replacing the beds were very comfortable and clean as was the whole of the hotel. Our room overlooked the sea and was very pleasant.Although the hotel is in a small village getting around was no problem with either the hotel taxis or the local tuk-tuks which are outside the hotel gate.We used the same tuk-tuk the whole time and we were taken to some lovely places we would never have found on our own. We would certainly have no reason not to recommend it. The evening entertainment on some of the nights was quite spectacular with the mask dancers and also a show in the pool.,neutral
It’s a bit run down in some common areas.,neutral
"The room itself was okay, relatively clean and fair in size. My biggest issue with the stay was that, when relaxing or walking on the beach, there were around 15ish street merchants constantly harassing me and other guests to buy their clothes (at extortionate prices compared to going to a local shop or market), as well as being badgered to book tours, again at 2-3 times the price when booking away from the beach. I have to point out that these were not hotel employees, but independent traders whom for some reason had access to the hotel every day we stayed there. The hotel offers a baggage handling service where they will move your bags to and from your room for you free of charge, however, be vigilant as personal items were stolen from our luggage between us leaving the room to checkout, and our bags being moved by one of the staff members. In all honesty, I have stayed at many hotels in different countries and I would say, this is the one time I have gone on holiday and not felt like I was actually on holiday as there was just that much badgering going on that it was almost impossible to relax. Upon walking out of the front gates of the hotel, you would have 4-5 tuk tuk drivers ask and try to take you to places you have repeatedly told them you do not wish to go and although this is not the hotel's fault, when it happens every single day, I feel as though it has to be mentioned. Anyone considering going to Sri Lanka, I recommend it - just consider staying somewhere else because for me, this was a 5-star mistake.",neutral

Stayed at the Heritance Hotel for 3 nights in October and was rather disappointed with the quality of the rooms and the rest of the building. It seems to me that many of the bigger hotels in Sri Lanka that trade as 5 star are in much need of refurbishment. Heritance - spend some money on the joint. 3 star at the best.

"Stayed in this hotel with wife and kid. This hotel has great architecture and nice pool. Food was excellent and can go again for food. However room was very small and compact for a class of this hotel and other hotels have larger rooms and better bathrooms. Service could have been better. Empty plates from others rooms were left outside the room and it was not very pleasant. Was planning to stay an extra day, however did not because of the room. Expected more from the Heritance chain, especially compared to Kandalama",neutral
"I have been to Sri Lanka on many occasions over the last 10 years, often combining work and leisure. My experience of Heritance hotels has been consistently good and Ahungalla was no exception. As with the other Bawa properties I have visited in Sri Lanka (Kandalama and Gallery Cafe for example), Ahungalla is beautifully crafted out of local materials, respects local traditions and also meets the needs of a tropical climate. Ahungalla is also located to provide a stunning view out to the Indian Ocean and several pools from which to enjoy the experience. Perhaps more importantly, the location and architecture are complemented with a warm and extremely professional team of hotel staff. Indeed, in my 30 plus visits to Sri Lanka, only Kandalama has exceeded this hotel in terms of service quality. I co-organised an academic conference at Ahungalla in September 2013, and many of the 142 local and international delegates were equally complimentary of the overall experience, but particularly the architecture and service quality. Unlike many other hotels that host similar events, Ahungalla also benefits from having conference halls somewhat separate from the main hotel. This benefits delegates and hotel guests alike, with the conference proceedings not distracting from the ambience of the hotel. The only slight downside is access. As with much of Sri Lanka, roads are not that good and congestion is common. The Expressway has helped somewhat, but it runs some way from the coast, where most hotels are located. Access from the airport is also difficult, but when the Outer Circular opens, which will bypass Colombo, this will certainly alleviate most of the access difficulties. Despite this and overall, an excellent experience and while I don't visit down South that often, when I do, I shall definitely look to stay at Ahungalla in the future.",positive
"Worst hotel I ever stayed at. Beautiful location though, although strong undercurrents so we could not swim in the ocean. Rooms terrible, staff not service minded at all. Everything worn down.

Rooms - We booked 4 deluxe rooms. Our deluxe room was spacious with music in the room. It was overall good. Two other deluxe rooms were smaller than this a lot but we're new. 1 deluxe room looked very old and was not spacious at all were disappointed to have in 5 star hotel. Bathrooms - Urs was spacious with music and a good showerplace. Other 3 bathrooms were very old and aging. the walls were no tiled as well and only concrete was seen. They were very small as well. Very disappointed. Food - This was a beachside restaurant but the buffet was not good at all. there were very few varieties of food and the only seafood for dinner was fish and prawns. Even the restaurant is too packed and not appealing. Others all good.

"We had a very relaxing and enjoyable vacation after spending 4 nights at this 5 star hotel in Ahungalle. We stayed in a luxury room and the rest of our group in 4 other luxury rooms which were all fabulous in their own unique way. All rooms were extremely spacious and we were upgraded to a suite which had a huge living room along with a separate master bedroom equipped with flat screen, DVD player and sound system, a huge bathroom with shower stall, elevated jaccuzzi tub, separate his/hers sinks and a huge wrap around patio with deck chairs. I'll post some pictures to illustrate but please note these were taken just before we left so naturally the room was a bit messy. The hotel has all the amenities for fun with 2 outdoor pools, tennis courts, badminton court and table tennis. The main outdoor pool by the lobby overlooks the ocean and is very picturesque. We particularly enjoyed the other pool which had the shade of a large tree and hence it was never too sunny for a swim. The food was good with seafood at every meal and breakfast was by far the best meal as well as one night with a Sri Lankan fare dinner. Jananjaya a waiter from the main restaurant went out of his way to please and provided the best service I've ever experienced in a buffet setting. Kaushal one of the housekeepers was also very attentive and made lovely animals for our son from towels. Even David P a trainee at the hotel went above and beyond to ensure we had a great stay. Overall from the time we arrived the service was impeccable and probably largely attributed to the very unassuming and nice general manager Upul Peiris who appears to be leading from the front and has clearly set a high bar for the service culture, he mentioned he had previously managed several resorts in the Maldives. The only downside to this hotel is it was designed by a famous Sri Lankan architect who believes in blending in with nature and hence it is not safe for young kids to wonder around alone since the stairways do not have rails, there are ponds all over etc. There is also no separate kids swimming pool. The beach by the hotel is very nice, however, the ocean maybe a little too rough if waves and body surfing are not your thing.",positive

"In Jan 2013 I spent several wonderful days with my wife in the Heritance Ahungalle, work of one of the renowned architects J Bawa.The reception was very friendly. It's a beautiful Hotel for a pleasant stay. The rooms are large, very clean and well furnished. There is also a large pool area. Beach is clean and lovely to swim. [ staff make it happen ]The friendly staff will make sure that every guest at the pool or beach is looked after. It is glorious to eat out with the sunset.",positive

"Some highlights, but not the 5 star experience desired.",neutral
"Absolutely no choice of food for a vegitarians. Even after the Manager and the Chef were appraised, having promised vegitarian food, they gave only two eggless hoppers after a wait of 20 minutes. Chef Dinesh gave an excuse saying that he had to manage the hotel with two chefs as others have gone for a competition. There is a massive choice for non vegitarians. They dont seem to care us as we are locals. I would not recommend this place as they dont have any regard for locals and especially for locals. We are waiting to get out of the hotel as it ruined our holiday and wasted our money.",negative

Even if you book in advance you may not get a good room!,negative
"Do not listen to those writing that the service is ignorant, for it is definitely not, you will be attended for any request, just keep in mind that the hotel is big and popular with the visitors, so let the service take some time. The rates are good, as well as the facilities. The place is not brand new, so you cannot expect fresh furniture, etc., but it feels like a solid 5-star hotel anyways, clean, spacious. The ocean is mostly rough to swim, but you can enjoy the pools or grab a cab to get to Unawatuna for a day. Nice library. The gym is different from the pictures on TA: the barbells have been removed, but the basics are still there for you. The breafasts are good, while I found the dinners to be overpriced if you go for a buffet option. There are many places around that are more affordable and enjoyable.",neutral
"Though the hotel was nice...but definitely needs maintenance. Our room 240 had broken door handles, lights needed to fix, very small bathroom. Good for 2 but didnt find value for money paid. Staff is super awesome and warm. Very nice people and hospitality",neutral
"We stayed 3 nights in a deluxe room - extremely comfortable and well appointed. Slept like a log every night. The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful at all times. The hotel itself was designed by renowned Sri Lankan architect Geoffrey Bawa, with great attention to detail - it is in a tropical style with lots of open space and courtyards/gardens within the hotel. Two huge swimming pools, and of course the beach (ocean swimming seasonal though). This is a great location for exploring the surrounding area - lots of other Bawa designed hotels and gardens to visit nearby, and of course the Unesco world heritage old town of Galle (Fort), which is a gem.",positive
Exellent,positive
Located in a lovely place near beach. Very friendly staff. Excellent food. All 3 meals are buffet. Enjoyed every moment of stay. Two big pools with bars. Pool staff is bit rude.not very supportive. Great for a vacation.,positive
"Have to say, its not a great hotel in need of some serious updating, lots of new hotels about to open very close by so they either need to up their game or rebuild the place. Beach sellers/beggers were a pest and security didn't seem too bothered with their presence, one lunch time we watched some sneaking in. Buffet restaurant, was not well stocked once the first lots of food was taken, the room didn't seem all that clean, bedrooms were tired, the ala cart restaurant was empty and expensive for the food on offer.",negative

"We stayed in the luxury suite which was spacious. The service from the staff was excellent and very obliging. A few issues which need to be resolved - 1) the facts in the information section in each of the rooms indicating that Tamils mostly arrived in the 19th century is fraudulent, 2) internet access needs to be improved such that someone doesn't need to re-register every time they leave the room or the hotel and return, 3) showers sometimes seem to not drain properly leading to flooding.",positive
Exceptional service.. Food was even better.. Best hotel around!!! Love the rooms and the atmosphere was perfect.. Don't hesitate to select this hotel if you are looking for a peaceful get away.. Can't wait to come back again with family next time..,positive

"Pointless in requesting any type of room beforehand. It didn&#39;t happen for us! As soon as we entered our room, there was a terrible smell of damp. On our balcony there was a white powder. I cleaned this up, and there it was again. It turned out they were decorating the room upstairs, and the &quot;powder&quot; was paint being rubbed down. You couldn&#39;t sit on the balcony without it getting on your clothes, and the stench in the room was really bad. In fairness, they said we could change room. I went to check and there was no smell or powder, and the room was prepared apart from bed and bathroom linen, but still they said it would not be ready for 24 hours. We then went for dinner around 9.00 pm. Unfortunately, the food had obviously been there since there since the start, and was either &quot;scrapings&quot; or what no one else wanted. Good nights sleep, then we both became I&#39;ll. I just had moderate sickness and diahorrea. My partner had diahorrea , but really, really bad vomiting. It lasted 15 hours, before he finally settled. Towards the end of this we were advised our new room was ready. I said how we sick we were. Probably, a language problem, but they offered us room service!!! The last thing we needed was food - we couldn&#39;t keep anything down. We couldn&#39;t move room - we were in bed, intermittently, using the bathroom.. By the following day, the powder has stopped appearing (later found out they had stopped rubbing down) and we kind of got used to the stench, and couldn&#39;t face packing up again and moving for 3 nights. _x000D_ The beach location is beautiful. The gardens are lovely. Our balcony view was lovely. _x000D_ The rooms are smelly and need updating(maybe why we got the powder). . I didn&#39;t enjoy the food, probably because we were ill, but it was varied, and maybe our sickness had nothing to do with it, who knows. But I would suggest you eat early, rather than later, when the food has been kept around for a couple of hours rather than replaced._x000D_ The food in the cafe is lovely, hot and freshly cooked. The staff are really good.",negative

"Room size was smaller than expected. After the baby cot was put in the room, it felt a lot more cramped for space. In house liquor was really expensive. The USD to LKR conversion rate applied by the hotel was pathetic.",negative
"We had the opportunity to stay for one night. The pool and beach were truly exceptional, providing a delightful experience. The variety offered in all three meals was impressive, with a wide range of flavors that were quite enjoyable. However, I must express my disappointment with the accommodations. The room we were assigned felt quite dated, and the beds were not particularly comfortable. Additionally, the air conditioning unit's controller was malfunctioning, which affected our comfort. The bathroom was notably small, particularly the shower cubicle, making it inconvenient for a comfortable bathing experience. It's worth mentioning that the absence of a hand shower in the bathroom was a drawback. Regrettably, we also found that the staff did not display the same level of friendliness towards locals. Considering our experience, I would suggest this establishment for a day outing rather than an overnight stay.",neutral
If you want an advice don’t book here. The rooms are okay but the food is terrible and the hotel is like very old and more like a 2 star ho,negative
"The hotel was a very big disapointment. we arrived late in evening, the guy at the reseption looked as he didnt feel like showing us arround, tired, bored (?). On the way to the room, he said that we had been upgrated from the room that we had reserved, we got to the room and the first thing I look at is the bathroom, there was a funny smell, when i told the guy he said that is nothing, we just spraid cinamon before you arrived. the towels were old and far from being smooth and nice. At 7 oclock we were woken up by restaurations done at the hotel; we were not told this was going on. All this is not a five star hotel!!! finally we were moved to a suite but still the higine was not perfet and towells not soft.",negative

"This hotel is one of the nicest hotels I've ever been. The personnel and staff is extremely friendly and helps whenever they can. The food is mainly local, some people hate it, others love it, but if you hate it, no problem, at the pool bar you can get burgers and fries. Room was very nice and clean, fresh towels 2 times a day and they even have a night service to open your bedsheets. Positive Points: - Friendly Staff - Nice local food - All inclusive formula is nearly perfect (will come back later to this) - Nice views of the pool - Nice, clean and big rooms - Wifi EVERYWHERE Negative Points: - All inclusive doesn't include ""light"" drinks, so as a person with Sugar disease you can not take Cola Light but only regular Cola. This is something where they should look for an alternative for people who can not have that much sugar and don't like water. - The people at the beach who try to sell you stuff, they are nice and friendly, but if you are friendly back and buy some stuff, they just keep coming asking for more, asking for drinks, milkshakes,... This is something to watch. Overall it's a very nice hotel and I will definitely come back to this one.",positive

"We stayed at the Heritance Ahungalla for our honeymoon and were not disappointed. Having done our research we liked the more traditional style, location and hotel size from looking at reviews on TripAdvisor. This is a beautiful hotel, very clean with some fantastic staff. I did unfortunately injure myself while we were there but the staff were very caring and attentive. The food was very good and there was a good variety although it was unusual that not all the restaurants were included as part of the all-inclusive and wine only available at meal times. Our room was beautiful and we had a stunning view of the beach which was right on our doorstep. The only piece of criticism I would have, would be that the walkways and grounds could do with a little more manicuring between the two pools as this looked a bit untidy. All in all we had an amazing stay and I would recommend this hotel. Sri Lanka as a country is beautiful with an abundance of exotic wildlife, culture and some of the friendliest people you will ever meet. This was certainly a memorable destination for our honeymoon, different from anywhere I have ever been and we would love to go back and explore more.",positive
Rooms facing the sea are better.,neutral
"I live in Dubai, so I know what a USD$400 per night hotel room should get you. Therefore, in Sri Lanka, it should be at least on par - if not a thousand times better. This review comes with a disclaimer – the hotel did compensate me with a rather dramatic discount upon departure. I do not believe that this hotel can realistically charge the amount they do for this level of property and service. In the end I believe we paid a fair amount for what we received. They begged me not to write a bad review, so I will not, but I will state the truth. Let’s start with the “pros”: - Beautifully designed hotel with authentic colonial architecture. - Lovely view from most of the balconies. - Several dining options available. - Good bathrooms. - Good a/c in rooms. - Massages at the spa are heavenly. Probably the best I’ve ever had! - Management responded well to our complaints. Now over to the “cons”: - The “confirmed” airport transfer was not booked. We waited 2 hours at the airport before they finally arranged. - Our room was filthy. Even after complaining it did not improve. - Room service, bar and snack menus are the same. No Sri Lankan food in sight! - Manicure and hair treatments at the spa were disastrous (rough nails and stripped colour from hair). - Dirty linen at all F&B outlets and room service.",negative
Poor room condition. Very old bathroom and room. Need to get a renovation. But nice location. Nice pool and nice beach. We went there with our friends wedding anniversary. We enjoyed sea bath lot. It's really good experience for us. We enjoyed a Very quality and very tasty buffet. It was really delicious and more varieties. There was a sea food corner also.,neutral
"When entering the hotel all the guests and bag are being checked by secirity personnels and metal detectors which is a good move to reassure safety. Valet parking is available. We were warmly welcomed and the reception was very busy atthe time we were checking-in. We were offered a welcome drink and a small snack as well as a refreshing face towel. The garden was neat and the lobby area was quite large and spacious. Furniture and the decor was modernised vintage looking. The room was looking so inviting and the lighting did its magic with the look of a lavishly renovated early bunglow. The bed was comfortable and so were the sheets and pillows. The view from our room was partially to the ocean and eventhough it was not directly centered at the ocean, the view of the sea from our room was spectacular. The food was on a buffet set-up and all of what I tried was delicious. Yet, I believe that the variety could have been improved, specially the breakfast service. On the other hand, the dinner was excellent! However, the lunch might not be the best buffets of Heritance Ahungalla I suppose. The buffet quality might be pressed down as a result of low rates being charged in this season to attarct more guests to the hotel. Moreover, the spa was relaxing and the therapists did their part well. Above all, the fragrance in the spa was fantastic. Unfortunately, we had a bad night. After having dinner, a function started at the hotel and we guessed that it was in the lobby area. It was extremely loud and we could not relax in the balcony or sleep inside. I am sure a manager or some authoritative personnel could have made a change in the location of the function. I understand that it was raining in the evening but the hotel might have a certain policy in terms of having functions at the hotel. There is ample space in the property and there might be a better place or a separate place to have functions. So, please make sure that such problems do not occur in the future. The aim of a hotel is to make all the guests delighted in their stay and not making ""some"" of the guests happy.",neutral

"We have just spent a wonderful 2 weeks at the Heritance Ahungalla with our 2 teenage daughters. The staff were very helpful and friendly especially Thushara, Dharshana, Anushka and Madhu. The hotel is situated on the edge of the beach and has amazing views over the Indian Ocean. Sri Lanka is a beautiful country with lovely people. .....everyone was so friendly wherever we went. We will definitely stay here again and would recommend this hotel 100%. Mary, Chris, Lucy and Katy Adams, Northampton, UK.",positive
"This hotel is positioned on a wonderful beach. While the hotel is starting to show its age the staff try very hard to look after the guests. The breakfast buffet is great to start the day and everyone should try the egg hopper! The beach is the real bonus of this hotel and the waves are great for body surfing. However, there is also one BIG downside. It would be great to be able to be enjoy the beach without the constant attention (unwanted!) of the touts trying to sell cheap and nasty products on the beach. It became so unwanted that we were forced to retreat to the privacy of the hotel, a not bad second option. Having spoken to the manager about touts it is clear that the hotel is trying to address the issue but is not there yet. I wish them success!",neutral

"We know the hotel as we used to stay there several years in a row some years ago. The architecture is stunning, but some improvements on the rooms are needed to bring it back to 5 star standards. Upon check-in we were early and were told that normal check-in time is 2 pm. We waited for 2 1/2 hours til 2 pm and several inquiries, there we were told, that they are checking. At 2 pm it seems everybody arriving after us was checked-in and we still did not get any information. I went to the reception to complain, but they were busy to set up other guests internet on the phone than to attend to guests who were waiting for 2 1/2 hours. After asking for the manager it suddenly worked and we got a room and apology. Although we asked for the new wing, we were offered a room in the old wing. Despite of kitchen odor this room was definitely the better choice for us as on the other side a 2 day party was going on with lots of noise. Room was ok and had a nice sea view. Cleanliness of the room could have been better. Especially in the shower there were signs of mould and shower door was completely covered with limescale. Service especially upon check-in was definitely not 5 star standard. Also for breakfast it was announced to start at 7 am, but when we came down ones at 7.10 am, nothing was ready, noone was taking note in order to serve coffee or tea. The egg corner was not occupied to order eggs, etc. If 7 am is published for breakfast, it should be ready for service. Food was very good though. Another point to reconsider might be the christmas decoration which did not fit the hotel at all. All in all we had a nice stay in the end. If we would come back, we are not sure as we know better from this hotel from previous stays and it is quite pricy for the service offered.",neutral

"I visited this hotel a couple of times & this is one place you should try for sure irrespective of whether you are a local or tourist. From the lobby itself you can feel the difference. True that there are many hotels with wonderful facilities...some might even have better facilities than here but the real factor that makes a difference here is the ""people factor"". The employees of this hotel made me & my team feel very special indeed. They have what I would call the personal touch which is the most important thing. I was truly amazed as to how far the General Manager,Residential Manager, Head Chef etc is willing to go to make us happy & make the visits simply perfect! If I were to commment about the faclities....lovely rooms...infinity pool...great restaurants...bar..sat TV....wifi....animators, DJs to facilitate groups....night club..beach view....etc..What more would one want? And also the food is worth every bit that you pay. The range they offer in their buffets is vast & delicious...it'll fit both young & old alike...I would recommend Heritance Ahungalla for a family\business trip without any reservations! Looking forward to my next visit there! Cheers!",positive

"Stayed in the Heritance Anhungalla for six nights in September. It is a smart stylish hotel designed by Bawa, Sri Lanka's foremost architect. Some may find it a bit stark and white, we loved it. The rooms were large with a lot of character; comfortable beds and a very diligent roomboys. Food in the main restaurant was buffet style with lots of choice and some interesting Sri Lankan dishes. Prices are a bit on the high side, there is a cheaper restaurant but the menu was limited. There are two pools, one is reserved for reidents, they have weekend visitors who can use the other pool. It is quite a large hotel but still got a bit crowded when they had a convention at the weekend. There are fabulous sunsets out to sea. The beach is heavily occupied by traders, the ladies have some good scarves and sarongs at cheap prices, guys want to sell you a boet ride or visit the restaurant down the beach. Some of our party did and found it very good and cheap. The beach boys are very polite, as are all Sri Lankans that we met and if you say you just want to be quiet and don't want to talk they leave you alone. The beach drops sharply into the sea and waves were popwerful so bathing is banned. This is one of the drawbacks of the hotle. The other problem is that there is nowhere to walk outside the hotel, if you venture out of the gate swarms of helpfull people appear! I think it's a great hotel for three or four nights, we got a bit bored after that.",positive

"This is the most difficult review I have written so far. The hotel has two parts – one is brilliant and another is terrible. Therefore I summed everything up and evaluated it as average. Brilliant points: Extensive, very clean beach with clean ocean water. Fantastic pool area (two pools fit for any taste) with very good service. Nice reception, pleasant and airy open lobby. Beautiful grounds with veritable zoo: variety of birds, squirrels, shy langur monkeys, almost friendly molitors, etc. Superb food both at evening and morning buffet. Terrible points: Rooms and bathrooms are outdated, dirty, smelly (sometimes smell of sewage is overwhelming) and ill-kept, some may be cockroachy. After one night I asked to change my room on the ground floor which totally awful to only slightly better on the first floor (at least with more light). Housekeeping is poor: rooms are not cleaned until very late and then, several hours later, in the evening there comes house keeping again for god knows what reason. Also in the dining area at one point the floor was slippery because of spilt fat and remained so for at least two days. Hotel spa prices are more than exorbitant, go for massage to the village. Beware when dealing in cash: bad exchange rate (and different than told at the reception) the cashier cheats (tried to swindle me and one of our group too), so count your money carefully. Even when in the hotel grounds (and especially on beach) you are periodically accosted by touts, seller of various goods, tuk tuk drivers, etc. If you leave the grounds and go to the village you are immediately swarmed with “helpers” who tussle between themselves and finally you will have one fixed “leach” who will follow all the time offering all kinds of goods and services. So, if you are indifferent to the room you sleep in, the hotel is perfectly all right, even great. But otherwise consider other possibilities.",negative
Excellent hotel with nice staff. But only thing is you should have more vegetarian options for all three meals.. beach is beautiful. Stay is very comfortable. Hospitality is excellent. ...thank you for the wonderful stay....,positive
Great Holiday- 18th July to 20th July 13.,positive
The food variety is magnificent the best I've seen out of the many hotels I've been to. I gave the 3 star rating just because how much i love the food and the creativity of the design in and outside the hotel. We called 3 times reporting in a technical issue in the room giving them 30-40 minute gaps but they didn't respond until we decided to yell at them. As usual we were given the room 45 minutes late. And is asked to leave right on time. The bed was okay but isnt the most comfortable. Staff is friendly and helpful . Loved that fact which is why I wouldn't wanna rate this any lower. Its a good place but could be better for this price,neutral

"have just returned after two weeks at the heritance in AHUNGALLA.We had avery good holiday& the hotel staff were very friendly & helpfull.The only thing that let this hotel down was the rooms which are in dire need of refurbishment.The bathrooms have a half glazed screen with blinds which i found very odd.Some of the walls are finnished in a polished concrete effect , which might have been fashionable thirty years ago but not now.However i do not want to put people off this hotel because the rooms are still comfortable & functional. we found the food also very good with a good selection to suit all nationalitys.The service in the pool bar could be a little slow at times & we did feel that people who were not on all inclusive got a better service than people who were .The other down side to this hotel is the distance to the airport . This can take anything between two & three hours depending on the traffic & the time of day. To conclude i would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to my friends.",neutral

"This hotel is showing it's age slightly. The rooms are fine and the surroundings are beautiful but just not quite top notch. However we found the standard of service to be superb and are surprised at some of the reviews rating the service poor. We ate dinner in the main restaurant once and the Mustard Cafe three times. One meal in the Mustard Cafe was not up to scratch - the stirred fried beef looked as if it has been made several days ago - all dried up. However all the other meals were excellent. Breakfasts in the main restaurant were very good. There are two swimming pools - one by the main entrance and one outside the north wing. This latter pool was huge and nice to swim in. We also paddled in the sea which is right outside the hotel. The waves were very strong while we were there so it was not safe to go swimming but the sand is beautiful. There are people selling on the beach - it is difficult to see how the hotel could get rid of them as presumably it is a public place. However we didn't feel too pestered as we just ignored them and they went away. All the staff were friendly and courteous. The room boy was especially cheerful and the room kept really clean, in fact they changed the linen more than we needed",positive
Amazing Heritence Ahungañ,positive
"Heritance Ahungalla is not by any standards a 4,5 star hotel. We have chosen it for our honeymoon trip as pictures seen on the website looked amazing and we also read many good reviews. However, our stay there turn out to be a great dissapointment and we won't be going back. To list just few problems you may encounter there : it is impossible to go for a walk on the beach as you are constantly pestered by locals who do not take no for an answer; cockroaches can be found not only on hotel corridors but also inside the rooms; the cutlery served at tables has leftovers of food stuck to it; the bed linen in the rooms as well as the curtains are stained and often with holes; the hotel provides hardly any toiletries and if so, they are stuck on the bottom of a ceramic bottles in a very small quantitiy; there are constant problems with electricity and it can go off for over 30mins at time. As for the service it is probably one of the most tiresom and annoying problems of all, as there is no communication between the team members serving meals in the restaurant, you need to ask several times for a pot of coffee or a bottle of water, provided that you will be understood by the waiter on the first occassion. If so, the requested drink may not be delivered at all, while few other team memers will approach with exactly the same question about your choice of drink but it will take ages for someone to actually deliver it to the table. The tips are expected while the service quality or rather its lack, does not jusitfy it at all. The most imposing are often the housekeeping supervisors (not the regular housekeepers- they work very hard and hardly ever strike a conversation with a guest), who can follow you down the corridor repeating few times that they are entirely responsible for cleaning your room....all obviously to be tipped. In case of any problems with the room calling reception is normally a waste of time, as you have to call back several times before someone turns up to deal with the problem. The hotel is full of damp and looks as if its times of glory have long gone. We have been travelling extensively over last couple of years throughout Africa and Asia and we are very much aware of difficulties some developing countries face, however we cannot find an explanation for advertising a very poor quality hotel as a 4,5 star resort.",negative

"We travelled around Sri Lanka for 2 weeks staying in 6 different hotels, and this was by far the worst service we received out of our entire stay. The hotel itself is nice, rooms spacious and clean, pool area is nice. We dined in the a la carte restaurant which was nice. Don’t bother with half board / all inclusive - there’s a handful of restaurants on the beach with better food. The worst part is there seems to be some American expectation of tipping for absolutely everything, and if you don’t then you simply won’t get served!! Despite many signs around the pool saying sunbeds can’t be reserved, it seems the pool boy is more than happy to reserve these for a tip. I was up at 7:30am (jetlag), and there was just 1 set of sunbeds left despite no one actually being by the pool! We stayed there until midday, and some of the reserved beds only became occupied at 11am! So frustrating for everyone else. One woman took the reservation off and the pool boy flat out refused to give her a towel, even arguing with her! She went and got her own, and by midday no one had come to claim the bed! Awful! We went to the bar one night, they saw us walk in. They proceeded to offer every other group table service but us! I had to go to the bar 3 times for menus, drink etc., yet they still charged 10% service! On check-out you get shoved in some tiny room round back to pay your bill which is actually quite intimidating. No one asked if we had a nice stay or where we were going next, or even said bye when we left! While I do appreciate Sri Lanka is a poor country and tipping is needed, this was the only hotel during our whole trip that had this greedy mentality. We saved hard for this trip and don’t appreciate being treated like lesser people because we don’t have lots of extra money for tips! They also seem to have no problem in letting touts in to the hotel who come up to you on your sunbed to sell you a sari! I get that this happens on the beach but they shouldn’t allow them in the hotel grounds.",negative

"Our first stay here in 2009 was on the very strong recommendation of Sri Lankan friends and we vowed to return sooner rather than later. Neither my wife or I recognised some of the negative comments on this site prior to booking our latest trip in December 2011 but we had some concerns. Those concerns were totally unfounded. From the moment we were met with refreshing cinnamon tea until the redoubtable Dudley packed our cases in the car at the end of our stay, it was total relaxation. The attitude of the staff is a delight and may explain some of the complaints - they have a wonderful ability of being remarkably attentive whilst appearing to be laid back which may be misinterpreted as appearing not to care.Nothing could be further from the truth. Some of the younger staff members are still extremely keen and their enthusiasm, whilst appreciated, intrudes slightly into the relaxed ambiance. They could do well to learn from Jacob. If you have the good fortune to have your table served by this gentleman you will understand the point I'm attempting to make. He is like a swan gliding serenely on the surface whilst away from view he is paddling like hell to ensure that you enjoy every minute in his care. Our room was excellent - the only criticism we could make was the that the Venetian blind in the bathroom was past its best.... this is really struggling to be negative. I can't believe that someone on here had complained about the food - how absurd! Not only was the buffet absolutely first class but the puddings were out of this world. A real trip down memory lane for persons of a certain age! Unsurprisingly, the dessert table won first prize in the hotel industry awards. Please don't take my word for this - our visit coincided with that of an annual trip of French gamblers(???!) to the hotel. They attacked each meal with that Gallic gusto which is unique, (complete with napkins tied around their necks!) - if it hadn't been up to standard I'm sure that it would have been the kitchen staff at risk rather than the food! When these lovely characters found that my wife was multi-lingual they hijacked her on a regular basis to tell the hotel chefs of their appreciation. Another negative comment I had read was regarding the beach folk. Yes, at times they can be boorish but they are trying to make a living. If you inform them that you are definitely not interested in purchasing anything today they will leave you alone. You are, however, missing the opportunity to chat to some fascinating people with experiences completely different to your own who would really appreciate the opportunity of honing their language skills on you - this is especially true of the clothing ladies. If all else fails the magic word to use is 'yanda!' whose interpretation is, I believe as rude as it is effective! We would like to thank the management team of Rifan (General Manager), Tilleth (Food and Beverage Manager) and above all the professional and gregarious Sampath (Assistant Manager) for a superb stay. You have staff and a hotel to be very proud of.",negative

"Returned after 10 years and found the place to be just as amazing as I remembered. What I didn't expect was the care and kindness from the staff. I was sent a surprise birthday cake after dinner! But i was moved by the assistance provided to us when my 4yo daughter slipped and fell near the pool just before checking out. Family members left in the hotel, while we were at the hospital, were looked after well. The staff were kind enough to arrange a special meal for us as we were not back till hours after the buffet lunch was over.",negative

"We have always wanted to stay at this hotel and this was the first time we had an opportunity. We stayed recently for a few days whilst visiting Sri Lanka. The hotel really needs to be updated, compared to other beach hotels this hotel stands out for being old and dated. Not a good place to be. The rooms are a good size and comfortable but everything needs to be modernised. The food was quite nice and really enjoyed our dinner and breakfast. The hotel is overlooking the sea and the views are great. Both swimming pools are really big and very conveniently placed. The staff make up for the disappointing look of the hotel. They are extremely nice and helpful. They really made our stay and amazing one. The price paid £ 155-160/- per night per room is really not a fair price for this hotel. Hence will not return.",negative

On arriving at Heritance Ahungalla……it was 3am and rain not waiting to come down: we didn’t appreciate until the next morning how wonderful and picturesque this place was until the following morning. Our first couple of days were spent getting to know the hotel and its people…….they are the most amazing group who go out of their way to make this a home from home and always have a sole on their face all the time. There are too many staff to mention individually but one who deserves special mention is Rukmal who worked his magic everyday on our room and his inventiveness with towels and flowers is a joy to behold…..we will miss you and your colleagues greatly and will look upon this as one of the most amazing holidays and locations we have ever been on and look at Rukmal’s leaving present for us on our last day……..think it demonstrates everything that is good about this place. Goodbye Sri Lanka and Heritance Ahungalla…….we will definetly return one day…..it’s a must !!!!,positive
I was there with my parents when I came on a holiday from the UK.Excellent place for a relaxing holiday with an amazing view of the sea. Great and very friendly staff and they were happy to help at anytime. Spacious and luxurious rooms with all the facilities. Food was amazing and there were lots of choices and it was exceptional. My special thanks goes to miss Dilinie Rajapaksha who gave us a tremendous support when I booked the hotel. There were two beautiful pools and the surrounding of the hotel was exceptional. I highly recommend this hotel and I’ll definitely visit this place during my next holiday from England.,positive

"Property : Beautiful architecture, bright outdoor spaces and two amazing swimming pools and a useless beach. Rooms: Needs an upgrade to the really bad lighting system. Rooms are very dark and not at all child friendly. Beds are comfy n pillows are great. Room cleanliness is not all satisfied. Cigarette hash underneath the bed looks as if it had not been cleaned for ages. Food: The Salads are not at all up to the standard. Soup was a good start. Main course buffet was a bit messed up. Potatoes burnt while the cuttle fish left raw n the crabs too sweet n also uncooked for dinner. Lunch was way better. The positive point is that the staff after informing made us an ala carte dish of crabs and prawns and it was amazing. Desert was spot on delicious. Variety was also another plus point. Staff: The happy smiling faces and welcoming gestures by the overall staff make you want to come back again to this property. Thanks to Mr Thushara the Food manager and the head Chef and also all the other staff for making our stay a pleasant one. We look forward to coming back to heritance Ahungalla with a better expectation. Imran Hinghora",neutral

"If you are into stuffing your face on buffets and booze, probably a great hotel for you. If you are looking for quality food and culture, or even 5 star service probably not for you. Outwardly the hotel looks great, they rely on the great infinity pool for the wow factor but scratch the surface and there is not much else a pontins holiday park wouldn't provide. Probably why there are limited photo's on the website apart from the pool. We paid extra for a luxury room, which was very nice but cost enough to justify. The room along with the friendly staff were the best parts of the holiday. Breakfast was average, dark, dingy, smokey (cooking smoke) buffet room. Nice cooked options, and hoppers. Waffles were very nice, but coffee served was just terrible. Green pool was OK, but cloudy water. Good green pool service Nice beach, but not worth visiting due to the constant hassle. People have to earn a living but it gets a bit draining to be friendly, only to be hassled to buy something every time you want to walk along the beach. Grotty and hot gym, with old equipment. Miles away from anywhere, so unless you want a 1/2hr tuk tuk ride to Bentota (which is fine and plenty of offers outside the gate) you are stuck with hotel options. The best food we found was in the mustard cafe, lovely curries. Everything else was overpriced euro buffet. Final nail in the coffin was check-out, no service at the nice reception desk, you go round to the back office, smelly little room where you que up to pay your $$$$ bill while the cashier argues and discusses other bills with clients and colleagues. Then the taxi you ordered with the concierge isn't booked after all, they just look at each other and call over the 20 year old smelly wagon. We refused to get in, and they got an equally smelly but slightly newer car for the 9000 rupee ride to Colombo. Smelly is a reoccurring issue here. Overall, 5 star luxury room (for the right $$$) in a 3 star resort......With a really good looking pool.",negative

Travelled here to part of our office annual trip and certainly lived upto the expectations. The rooms are well maintained and face the sea. Our room located in 4th floor(some staffers say 'sachchin's suite) that faced the sea and the wind blowing towards us. What I liked most was the pool which was amazing in the evenings. It faced the sea and gives a stunning sight towards sunset.,positive
"I stayed at the Heritance at the end of October for 3 days. The hotel is beautiful and makes the most of it's stunning surroundings. We opted for half board and were very impressed with the selection of food on offer for breakfast and dinner. The live cooking stations were a great addition. The staff were very friendly and made an effort to remember us and our preferences. The infinity pool is large and lovely, and as we went out of season there were plenty of sun loungers. However there didn't seem enough if the hotel was full. The only downside was the electrics and power points in the room. During our short stay we had three power cuts, the only power sockets in the room that we could use where to power the telly and mini-bar so we would have to simultaneously remove one to be able to charge phones, or straighten hair. The other sockets available didn't fit any sort of travel plug (I'd packed a world compatible one and it still didn't work!) the room comes with a kettle and tea making facilities however even the kettle plug didn't fit in the sockets! Slightly disappointing side to an otherwise lovely hotel.",neutral

"This place has deteriorated unbelievably. I have visited the hotel on multiple occasions. In the early 2012s the Hotel was decent with friendly staff. Now its all gone down sour. I revisited again in 2016 but was shocked to find out that the standards have turned so bad. Firstly, I was welcomed by the usual friendly smiles and what not but the staff at the pool were extremely rude, and racist... I took some family visiting from the middle east for lunch and soon found that the hotel service made them very upset. They tried to use the pool, however soon knocked back and told that 3 quarter shorts weren't suitable for pool. These idiots have no idea. As a traveller in many western countries, I have never seen such fools running a hotel.. They don't know what guest services means... then the racism part kicks in where the staff are plain rude and are like robots and smiles at white skin guests, but frowns upon anyone with a tinge more of colour... Absolutely ridiculous and I discourage anyone from travelling and staying at this hotel....",negative

"Ahungalla Heritance Hotel is reassuring when you arrive through its private drive after passing the entrance arch gate. It keeps being reassuring when you discover the open reception to the swimming pool that visually extends straight into the Indian Ocean just few meters away until … you end up checking in at a bar behind the reception that was very dark as most of its lights were switch off; was it a try of being Eco friendly ?? We had a strange feeling that the hotel was not up to its 5*. This obvious detail was like the top of an iceberg; will we discover the rest of it along our stay? Was Heritance a 5* iceberg? The room was ok, yet had aged and would need a lift. There was no safe deposit (5*?). The room maintenance appeared secondary as we noticed an obvious splash of dirt on the terrace door window and one of the door lock was broken. At “Mustard coffee shop”, we ordered seafood salad, it came with no salad or veggies (misleading salad term). We checked the “UpperRestaurant” menu and were not impressed by its presentation neither by the incomprehensive culinary composition of its expensive dishes. The restaurant was empty … lack of soul, poor lighting, no spark. Instead we went to this little Coconut Hut restaurant down the beach out of the hotel, where we really had a superb and reasonable diner, thank you to Berthy the owner for his welcome. We recommend it. Back to our room, we were not blown by the auto glorifying video of Heritance Ahungalla that was played in random on the hotel TV channel, it sounded too superlative to be true. The Heritance corporate management needs to open its eyes, international real 5* hotel are on their way to Sri Lanka and soon they may be at the origin of the end of Heritance Hotels 5 * era. The F & B department should also be worry and revise its restaurants concepts and put its heart and mind into it.",neutral

"Originally designed by Geoffery Bawa this is a hotel with impact. Beautiful pool areas and superb setting. The staff are always polite and friendly - always ready with a smile and going out of their way to assist. When booking a room be sure to state if you want a double rather than a twin. This hotel codes 'double' as twin beds positioned next to each other. So for a shared bed you need to request a 'king size' upon booking. A small irritating change of descriptor that lead to many a confusion and many a room change request I'm sure. The rooms are of a good size with brilliant en suites - great power showers. We had a large balcony - more of a terrace which was perfect for a g&t as the sun went down. We were on an all-inclusive package eating from the main restaurant each meal whilst in the hotel. Whilst I am never a fan of buffet style dining the quality and range of good was astounding. Always a fab selection of salads and local fruits as well as everything in between. We sampled do many new local dishes - one chef even cooking a new dish to try especially for me! If however it's Mediterranean/English fare you fancy whilst in the tropics, well then too you will not be disappointed. There were always about eight non-local dishes and about the same of Sri Lankan. Plus - if you're still peckish - a dizzying array of desserts. We arrived out of school holiday season and both pools were perfect for working off all that food, or pootling about in. On the last days of our stay however considerably more families arrived which made the pools, whilst beautiful, a little impractical for a full hotel. Whilst Western standard five star this certainly is not, overall it's a fine all inclusive offering.",positive
朝食からディナーまでビュッフェで、作り置きのものしかない。全く美味しいと感じられなかった。 大規模なホテルで団体客も多いので仕方がないかもしれないが、１人で泊まる時は、ここではなく、小さな居心地の良いホテルを選ぼうと思う。 食事以外は建物もプールもキレイで悪くない。,negative
"We have just enjoyed a relaxing time at this hotel celebrating our wedding anniversary. The hotel provides a beautiful setting on the sea front with lovely gardens and two large pools clean and well maintained. The Pool staff are very attentive to guests needs when using these facilities. Whilst the local area is very quiet this is a good location from which to explore the South Western coastline of Sri Lanka and access to a number of popular tourist spots nearby. The staff at this hotel have been superb, eager to please guests and happy to ‘go that extra mile’ to make visitors feel welcomed. We must give special mention to the following staff for their hard work and for making our stay feel extra special - Jacob, Asitha, Jagath, Nimsara and Sinari. A big thank you also to Lokusuviya for his hardworking cleaning and tidying our room each day and the really friendly young man serving in the hotel gift shop! The food served in the main dining room was of a good quality and always offered a good choice of different Asian and Western dishes. We also took advantage of the drinks and snacks regularly available at the Pool side snack bar! During our stay here we were lucky to enjoy all the festivities and additional events organised by the hotel to celebrate their special New Year. We booked several trips during our stay with Rasika, a local guide, who can be found at the edge of the hotel/beach front. He offers good value and local knowledge/experience and we were happy to support local people rather than the large companies. We were fortunate to enjoy the Elephant Safari at Udawalawa, the Madu river cruise, a day trip to the Galle Fort town and spent time at Hikkaduwa swimming with the large Turtles. We also arranged to see the iconic Stilt Fishermen, the rather moving Tsunami Museum and spent time relaxing on the lovely beach at Unawatuna. Thank you again to ALL of the hardworking staff at Heritance Ahungalla hotel. We have really enjoyed our stay here.",positive

"We stayed the night in a luxury room with a huge sitting/dining area and a separate king bedroom area. Lots of space for our little ones. Room was well appointed and amenities as listed on hotel website. Eventhough bathroom was good size, the raised up jacuzzi tub with an overhead shower was impratical. Literally need to climb in and out of the tub. We didn't experience the award winning cuisine from the buffet dinner. (Extremely salty grilled prawns, burnt BBQ meat. Poor food presentation). Breakfast was a tad better. Our benchmark was the dinner buffet at Heritance Kandalama. That's what we called award winning. We enjoyed the two pools and the wonderful beach right at the hotel doorstep. The service from the staff was excellent. Hotel ground was beautiful with a majestic view of the Indian Ocean especially from the lobby.

1st Strange that I am the first to review this in 2015 despite this been a popular destination. Before going I had a look at the web site. I saw a couple of brocken links and informed them but they did not respond back to me... I was a bit skeptical as a 5 star hotel needs to keep its web site 5 star. My skeptism was correct when I went there... I felt the staff was not bothered about good service. They were in general NOT FRIENDLY. The hotel I found not to be well maintained. Things are getting old and discoloured. They did not have a changing room for the pool. Thus you need to change in your room and go. Through the hotel to the pool (I am talking about the main pool). Food was good. Generally it was ok but I was expecting a lot more. I would say this is more of a 4+ star hotel than a 5 Star.,neutral

Other meals were good too. Loved the in house guests only pool as compared to the main pool as it had more shade. But main pool had a lovely view of the ocean. This hotel has its charm in its design and fittings. Not like the neighbouring Riu which I'm sure is great but is more modern and ... well white. The beach here is clean and really nice. Nothing much near the hotel, except the turtle hatcheries. May not appeal to many but do understand that at least the eggs are being hatched and released rather than consumed. So don't begrudge the entrance fees.",neutral

"I'm from Kandy. We (myself and my wife) went to Kandalama in dabulla and had a great time So we wanted to take our parents as well. It's pointless of going to the same place (Kandalama) twice therefore we decided to go to ahungama heritance since it's all from the same family. There's about 220km from kandy (up and down both about 450-500Km) it was along trip. by the time we got to the hotel it was 5.00pm on 05/12/2015. We told the reception we have 2 bookings, one double room and one triple room. The welcoming lady was a fat girl and she was very rude to us she did not support at all even when filling the forms during the check in. and she took us to our rooms Double room (215)was ok but the triple room was very small (216) and fully packed most of all there were only 2 beds, so when i inquire about the 3rd bed from that girl we said "" Ah.... ok i will send a folding bed for you"" As if like we are servants/slaves. I told her politely. I request for a triple room and I have already done the payment by visiting to your headoffice at aitken spence colombo. Her reply was ""all our rooms are this size there is nothing we can do"" I said if you put another folding bed here, there is no space even to walk in this room. Her reply was ""Sorry"" she said it in a way either you take the room or go home, and she went away saying she will send someone with the folding bed. My mother said ""don't be mad putha we all came here to enjoy not to fight the other room(215) seems to be a bit large so we shifted to the next room. Then again I thought I already paid for a triple room and I don't get the service I wanted. If the hotel has only double rooms, they should have told me when booking. they never told me that. I got mad. I called the reception and requested to connect with the manager. Unfortunately manager was not there and an executive officer was available named ""Chathuranga"" I told him about my situation. I have child about 10 months old. Myself mywife my child and my mother all are staying at this room, and the room is too small. he quietly listened to my situation and he asked me 5 mins and call back. then he called me and say ""sir we have a large room vacant you can shift to that room"" I was delighted we all went there to enjoy not to suffer and stay in a room like in a prison cell. Then again I called to chathuranga and appologised him for getting mad and raising my voice what he told me shocking. he told me ""sir it's better you told me now rather than checking out, if so we couldn't have done anything for you.",negative
"Hard to fault this place as its defiantly got some class and style. Coming from Western Australia we did find the beach a bit disappointing and bizarrely very unused , most likely due to the hassle that the tourists get from the local hawkers. We got a suite upgrade for one of our rooms which was very nice and the other room was great too. Buffet breakfast was pretty good but had a very disappointing ala carte dining experience including a nearly 90 min wait for main course, which was pretty average. Pools were nice . The hotel really needs refurbishment which I believe is happening later in the year . There is also a monster new hotel being built right next door. Staff were lovely. All in all , a really good hotel just needing a facelift",neutral

"Its my fifth time in Heritance and the standards continue. They have a good selection on dinning, though the dessert range seem to have come down a bit. The Fire dance entertainment is a bit of a joke. We Sri Lankans can never do it like the Africans. We rather do what we are good at like a Low-country mask dance, would have certainly thrilled the visitors than the ""Fire Dance"". Such dance would have even entertained the Local crowd as well as the foreigners. Parking lot for the residents can improve. Big hump (almost not visible) on the entrance gate brushed up in to my chassis of my new 2013 year car ! Wish that did not happen. Also the parking area is full of grass. They have Baby/Kids care facillity. Had we known before, we would have been prepared to get use of it.",neutral
"Me and my wife stayed there in 20-21 of June, 2015 weekend (one night stay) to celebrate our second anniversary. We were in a deluxe room and it was clean and spacious. The staff was great and we were very happy about their service. And the food was amazing... all the meals were in buffet with lots of varieties and they were very tasty. And there are two pools. One pool (called Green Pool) is only for the residents and it is very beautiful. We enjoyed a lot and would like to thank all the staff for making our stay wonderful.",positive
"We vacationed with friends from 02/12/24 to 02/19/2024. The hotel is super, I don’t know who writes angry reviews. You need to understand that this is Asia. The hotel is very clean, they cleaned and changed towels every day. There are only 2 bars, one is always empty, unfortunately, the second bar always has delicious cocktails and beer (beer is so-so, like lemonade), but whiskey and cola is super. The waiters are very attentive; in general, Sri Lankans themselves are very kind. When it comes to food, you won’t be left hungry; be sure to try the oysters, incredibly tasty. There are many Russians, 70-80 percent, the rest are Europeans, but everyone is very cultured, no one bothers anyone. There was a lot of security; once I was going to the beach to visit friends at night, the security escorted me to make sure I was not alone. The ocean is gentle, the waves are just super, I don’t know who needs a lagoon, the ocean without waves is a lake😁 on excursions: here they are trying to deceive our brother everywhere. Valuables just speak from their heads. We went to Kandy with Kamal, I’ve attached the number. He speaks Russian and charged us for an individual session, less than what we were charged for a group session. +940776085334. Lobster at the hotel was expensive. He even offered to buy it and fry it for free in a cafe from his friends.",positive

At the bar we ordered Black rum Bacardi, they brought it local for the price of Bacardi and also included service for what????????? Because they tried to sell local alcohol at the price of imported alcohol!!!! They also added 18% tax to the price indicated in the price list.

Everything was o k except for few service setbacks in some areas. But my concern is that the food quality and selection . it didn't stand out despite having the most awarded celebrity chef. The hotel must be careful in selecting the range if foods that compliment each other and food taste was of average quality. When the hotel is championing their chefs individual brilliance they must make sure same is trickled down across the board,neutral

"Just returned from an 11 night stay at Heritance Ahungalla and already making plans to return. Check in was fast and faultless. The room was well appointed, spotless and, considering the amount of guests, quiet too. Efficiently cleaned daily (even the balcony), tea/coffee replaced, evening turn down service, couldn't fault it. Having spent a month travelling,in Sri Lanka, this was by far the best hotel of my trip. Breakfast buffet was something to look forward too with a superb and varied choice. The evening meals had a different theme with a massive array of western and asian dishes, all cooked and presented at a high standard. After a longish stay at a hotel, buffet meals can sometimes become a bit tedious with a longing to eat elsewhere, but despite several beach cafe choices, we were never tempted away from the quality food served at the hotel. Getting tea and coffee could require a bit of patience in the mornings but this is not logged as a complaint just a niggle when you need your early morning caffiene fix. The pools are amongst the best I saw in Sri Lanka, cleaned daily, the grounds kept neat and tidy and the beach vendors kept at bay by security and a respected boundry line although they do become a complete nusiance shouting and calling out to try and sell their goods but after a couple of days they tend to get the hang of who is worth pursuing and who needs to keep having sales tactics applied to. Beach is a beautiful mile plus of fine sand backed by palm trees and suprisingly free of plastic debris; not totally free but judged against standards of some asian beaches and the collection of bags etc that gets washed up, it's a gem. Only problem is that a walk along this beach is punctuated by the attention of several 'best friends' you never knew you had that want to get you to a cafe/gem shop/ tour but a firm 'no thanks' seems to be respected. There is a handy wine shop to the right of the hotel and several little shops that sell most stuff you could need but don't let any of the men that pounce on you the moment you walk through the gate follow you or continue any sort of converstion as they will be clocking a commission at your expense for taking you to the shop. They get the plan and politely telling them to stop, stay here and don't follow me is respected and didn't cause offence. Would I return to this hotel, too right I will. Would I recommend it, absolutely without hesitation!",negative

"At one stage furing the tour planning, we planned to stay two nights at Heritance, Ahangulla. We thank our forefathers that we decided otherwise. It would have been an expensive disaster had we stayed there any longer than the 12 hours that we spent there. I can not fathom who ever gave this hotel a five star rating. It must be with the help of some under hand dealings. The mistake I did was that the tour was booked through the agency who owned this hotel. There is an obvious conflict of interest here. This is at best a three star hotel.....nothing more. Minuses: unclean floors, dirty pool, dirtier pool towels, fountain with black water in the front of the hotel and by the side of the main dining area, walls, roof all badly needing a stroke of paint, cracked walls, beaches infested with intrusive locals, stray dogs....

"We decided to stay at Heritance Ahungalla as it was designed by an architect that we like - Geoffrey Bawa. Later we realized so are many hotels en route Ahungalla from Colombo. Having said that, it sure is a beautiful hotel with two vast pools overlooking the beach. The brand is all about the blend of tradition and modernity. The service staff were all in their white sarongs with white shirts. The rooms were a bit disappointing. We requested for a triple room and realized that it is a double with an extra bed. We really thought there would be more space. The maintenance was not as good and lamp shades were falling off. For a property of that size and price the in-room amenities were dated including a large tube television that juts into the walk path. There were a lot of renovation going on and we had to walk through scaffolding all the time. We also had this noon drills and plumbing noise that would not let us take that much needed siesta. The food was again a strong blend of Lankan and Continental. I was ok with an odd piece of dried fish in my food. My wife and kids were not. So I had to taste the dishes before they ate. But the traditional food was enjoyable and we gorged. There is a fine dining restaurant in the property and I would rate that very high. The pools were fabulous - clean, well maintained and addictive. The gym was old, grubby and rusted (most of the equipment were not usable). When we go to Sri Lanka again we will not go south as it is intended to rip off unsuspecting tourists. And so we will not stay at Heritance Ahungalla either. I think all properties in that stretch of Bentota, Ahungalla are overrated. I would rather stay in a boutique property at Fort Galle.",neutral
"This is by far my most favorite hotel in Sri Lanka... It's luxury and comfort with the welcoming and relaxing feeling of being right at home.. The staff are extremely friendly and accommodating and went out of there way to tend to our every need.. Exceptional service which I have never experienced anywhere.. The food was fantastic.. The rooms were beautifully decorated, very comfortable and well thought of with all the amenities you would need.. They even helped us make baby food for my little niece..

"Overall, the facilities were nice but we found this property to be poorly managed. 1) Check-in process wasn't organized well. 2 days after check-in, I was contacted and told I had an extra person and I had to pay more money. They didn't even bother understanding their error! We had provided all passports at check-in and we had booked 3 rooms. They had mixed up the adults/kids in the rooms and thought we tried to sneak in an adult at a kid rate. How is that possible if we provided our passports at check-in??? Then at check-out I was still charged and had to get it resolved again. 2) Food was average. And the setup is not optimal. Buffet is split into 2 rooms, with one room having large, open doors which basically let's in bugs/flies. This comes across as unhygienic and dirty. 3) When sitting out by the pool, had to ask 3 times to get towels and ended up getting them ourselves. 4) The room setup isn't good. The bathroom has blinds so it makes it really awkward for someone to use the bathroom. Also, the thermostat directions are on the balcony door (why not next to the thermostat). 5) We arrived on a Wednesday and were excited there would be a show. The show was terrible with what appeared to be some sort of mime type of performance. 6) The gym is a joke! You don't even feel like working out. It's small & cramped with old equipment. 7) There is one elevator that is old and slow.",negative
"Had mixed feelings about the hotels. I was not bad but was never 5 star. The check in could have been done in a more pleasing manner. The staff was too harsh, not even with a proper smile on the face to welcome the guests. The much needed cold towels were not provided. We stayed in a standard room and is quite ok though three's nothing outstanding. The furniture was of good quality and the rooms had a prestigious look. We stayed in a tripple and the extra bed was a total disappointment. The mattress was terrible. The verandah of the room was nice and big. Toothbrushes, tooth pastes and a shaving kit was missing in the room. I had to give a few calls to get them to my room. there was central air conditioning with temperature control, but yet the temperature controller seemed not to work right. The bathroom was ok but could have been bit more large. The common areas of the second and the third floor was neither air conditioned nor had proper ventilation. So you can hardly relax on a sofa there. the food was good. had nice sea food. But need to have a few notches up to get it to 5 star level. The service was terrible. the staff is too harsh. No body has a smile on their face and you would have a real unpleasant situation. Those in the dining were ignorant of the guest's needs. During the dinner I had to ask five times to get a bottle of water. They take hours to prepare a new table. A really inefficient staff lacking the professionalism. The two pools were really good. both really large and well maintained. The green pool has a great privacy and is much better than the main one. That of course is 5 star. The towels by the pools were too old and doesnt sute for the five star quality. If you are finding some nice hotel to stay near Galle and if your budget permits the best would be the ""The Fortress"" Koggala and even the light house hotel may do better.",neutral
Unforgettable stay at Heritance...,negative
"We were unfortunate to stay at this hotel on a day that they celebrated the Earth Day in 2023. We love, encourage, and actively participate in similar programs. The problem was, how the hotel management went about the celebration and their lack of planning. Hotel management decided to shut all electrical lights in the downstairs lobby area, then lighted kerosene torches. There were so may kerosene torches lit all over the area (including bar, near pool etc.) and the smell was unbearable, air was unbreathable. Add 100C temperature and humidity to the situation and it was absolute hell. What was the point of this stupid show? They probably added more pollutant to the air by burning all the kerosene for few hours than the greenhouse gases emitted to generate electricity. Stupidity at its best was in display at Heritance Ahungalla on 3/23/23.",negative
"The building and the smiling staff builds up a expectation. The logistics are a mess. Takes to long time for small things. Its a general gender problem in Sri Lanka.

We went to this hotel for a weekend stay with another family. Hotel looked very old but since this is a Geoffrey Bava creation it’s still of so much value. We stayed for one night and was on full board basis. Food was average because of the variety. Sri Lankan food was there but still for a 5 star hotel not good enough. Staff were friendly but overall service needs to improve. They lacked energy and interests. Across the hotel we felt there was some sense of boredom. Room was ok but then again it looked old style if you like them. Overall this is a good hotel which may be in need of a new theme and a service upgrade.,neutral

"Overall I would say this is a superb hotel and would definately recommend it to anyone wanting a relaxing place to stay. The hotel is very clean, the rooms are large and spacious and all the staff are very accomodating. The two infinity pools are lovely and the loungers around them can be moved in to the shade very easily or in to the sun when required. As we went off peak it was incredibly quiet and for 3 days there were only 2 couples around the second pool. The beds are very comfortable and the bathrooms well equipped with large showers and always immaculately clean. Breakfast was always very good with a huge range of food, with omlettes freshly cooked to order. Try the Egg Hoppers! Evening meals were available in the main restaurant generally tended to be from a set menu and were always a high standard - although the Sri Lankans tend to put two different dishes on one course. The Coffee Shop was also very good - you have to try Rice an Curry - a real treat. The Negative Points: On two occassions I sent food back only to have the original food returned........ the first was a chicken burger which I specifically requested to have no cheese on, it was returned with cold chips and the cheese scraped off - absolutely disgusting in my book and they were very apologetic about it. However the waiter spilt an orange juice over another plate of food and said he would get a fresh one, but when he returned the food was still soaked with OJ and underneath the salad there were remnants of the juice, so once again the plate had just been wiped down. I understand they were incredibly quiet but keeping costs down at the expense of the guest is not on. At weekends a lot of Sri Lankans tend to come and stay and the hotel becomes incredibly noisy. If you like early nights and peaceful sleeping I would definately recommend you request a room away from the main pool area. We arrived and were put in to a room facing the main pool and just on walking in the room knew it would be too noisy. We could still clearly hear the Fri and Sat night entertainment in our replacement room and Sat night there was really loud music on until midnight. If you value some peace ask for rooms at the far ends of the hotel. A word of warning regarding the beach hawkers...... unfortunately we had a bad experience with Emile De Silva, we arranged a couple of trips and an evening meal at the Sunshine Restaurant. Whilst the trips were 'ok' I felt crowded by having him, a driver and someone else join us (a trick for getting more money out of us by asking for bigger tips), they rushed us around the nice places and didn't really give us any space and didn't deliver on the glass bottomed boat, whilst still wanting the same money. The evening meal also never materialised with 2 different excuses given and then making us walk miles down the beach to another location which was actually on the road. We lost 1000 rupees as we refused to go as they had not told us earlier in the day there was a problem. Otherwise the other people on the beach were great, the ladies selling the 'sari's' were great fun and whilst they did try and call us over all the time they were lovely. Whilst the negative points above need to be considered, please don't let it put you off. The hotel was wonderful and all the staff would fall over themselves to help. It certainly looks by far the most superior hotel on that coastline. We have certainly agreed we will be returning in 2 years time. Tourism in Sri Lanka is desperately needed and when you spend your money you are treated like Kings. Tip: Take a trip to Unawatuna - a stunning little beach outside Galle which was charming and filled with the locals.",positive

Although we had a room with a beach view it was above the bar area - and each evening we had to endure really loud really awful karaoke type music. Luckily this only went on until just past 11 but it sure wasn't the peaceful, relaxing stay we had anticipated. We asked to change rooms but were told it was not possible. The food was luke warm and the service, particularly for drinks, was slow. We did enjoy time spent around the quieter of the 2 pools and the beach was only a short stroll away. There were touts but we got used to them, it's a third world country after all. It wasn't a disastrous stay by any means but I would describe it as more of a 3 star than it's supposed status of 5 star - so it's expensive for what you get.

"In general: Architecturally very generously designed hotel complex with beautiful green areas directly on the Indian Ocean. The hotel definitely stands out from other hotels due to the friendliness and exceptional service of the staff. Thanks for letting me be part of the Heritance family for three weeks. I will definitely come back. Rooms: The rooms are larger than average and have a kettle and refrigerator in addition to the general standard. Recommended is the “laundry service”, fast, clean and inexpensive. The housekeeping was good, thanks for the towel animals or flowers on my bed. In the evening the bed was revealed, the curtains were closed and if necessary the towels were changed again. Restaurant/Bars: In the restaurant, the high level of service is noticeable. You are led to a table set with cloth napkins and bread plates at each meal. Light background music underlines the atmosphere. Thank you Duminda, the good soul of the restaurant, and thank you Jananja for the always professional service. The offer as well as the quality of the food were above average and prepared with a lot of attention to detail. Extra wishes were also gladly fulfilled. Thanks for that, Kavindu. I was lucky enough to be able to take part in the gigantic buffets on Christmas and New Year's Eve. Chapeau Keshan!!! Service: The absolute plus of the hotel is the leadership and exceptional service of the staff. You always feel welcome as a guest. Staff are always friendly. As a solo traveler, I never felt lonely, but rather as part of the hotel family. Danke an Jayaru, Guest Relations Executive. She's helped me with some of my affairs. I'm really looking forward to seeing you again. Location/surroundings. Directly in front of the hotel entrance you can take public transport or tuk tuk to the surrounding towns. Excursions I booked through Sunil. You can find him on the beach. He speaks good German and is very reliable.",positive

"This is a very nice hotel to get some rest and recreation, especially for a family with kids. Although the hotel is old, it has some great architectural features. There are courtyards with lush foliage, which gives a cool atmosphere. The grounds are full of trees too, which provides well-needed shade during the daytime. Big pool and the ocean is right next to it. The rooms are also nice and comfortable. The design and interiors are a bit old fashioned, which I personally liked, but not if you are looking for modernism. The staff is very friendly, and the food is quite good, with a lot of variety at all meals. They even had a kids table, which I found very quaint.",positive

"We stayed from 18 to 21 January with a group of 13 family members. This was the second hotel in the Heritance group we stayed at during our 23 day holiday in Sri Lanka. Compared to Heritance Kandalama Ahungalla was a real disappointment. It looks great when you first arrive - the pool looks fantastic but everything else about it was disappointing - the tiles in the foyer area and along the corridors are stained, the bathrooms need a really good scrub, the food in the buffets was boring and many of the staff looked like they just didn't want to be there. Overall there just didn't seem to be the attention to detail we saw at Kandalama - we booked 3 double rooms, 2 twins and one triple room. On arrival the 3 doubles were all made up as twins and the triple had only 2 beds. One of the couples called reception on arrival to have the beds remade as a a double and had no problems, the second called and was told that it was not their practice to do that and in order to have a double bed the couple would have to be moved and that couldn't happen at the time because the hotel was full, the third couple then rang and was upgraded to a better room, despite the previous couple being told that there were no other rooms at all. In the triple room a small fold out bed was provided and most of the first evening was spent trying to explain to the staff that the tiny bed was not large enough for a teenage boy. Eventually after much conversation a better bed was provided. My parents have visited this hotel 4 times, however I would not go there again. In its current condition it is not worth the price charged.",negative
"We stayed at this place for 4 days 3 nights - US$1,100, included a lame New Year buffet and ""celebration"" (US$125 per person) This hotel bore no resemblance with its sister hotel in the same group Heritance Kandalama (where we stayed over Christmas and which was impressive). The architectual and design elememts that make Heritance Kandalama very special are total lacking in the Heritance Alungalla. The level of service could not compared. The attitude of staff generally was insincere and gear towards tips rather than service. We also had 2 experiences of male staff members making inappropriate comments to the females in our group. The food was uninspiring at best and unhygenically prepared at worst (one of our party and a known other guest were both made ill by poor food preparation.) When the issue was raised on our departure with the most senior staff member made available (only a room division manager), no responsiblity was taken nor apology offered and the stock response was that the guest had not until then made a formal complaint (despite the matter being known to reception and housekeeping staff) and the guest was blamed for not having asked for a hotel doctor at the time. The room we had was an attempt maximizing a corner area and was at first glance impressive. However, not all the electrics were wired up and the basic layout of the location of the light switches was poor (you have to get out of bed to turn off the bed side light). And one of the toilet in the suite smelt which affected our enjoyment of the suite. We couldn't use the sitting area of the suite. To cap it all, having paid US$100 for a vehicle to take us to the airport, the hotel provided a desperately underpower, mini people mover which had no safety belts for passengers (an essential requirement for Sri Lankan roads). Compared to the rest of our experience of accommodation in Sri Lanka, Heritance Alungalla was over-priced and poor value. It is definitely not 5 star accommodation as it claims to be. It just seems to be a money making ""machine"". The main positive point about this hotel is the beach which is beautiful like the rest of the West coast of Sri Lanka (you do have to however put up with beach touts). We will be lodging a formal complaint to the hotel but given their initial response we do not expect any joy.",negative

"Having had our honeymoon at the Heritance Kandalama 6 years ago, during this years' vacation to Sri Lanka we decided to experience another Heritance Hotel with our families and we are more than happy over the stay at Heritance Ahungala. The pictures do not do justice to the beautiful landscape and ofcourse the highly commendable team; the excellence of service by the Aitken hotel staff is something I always admire. Very smooth checking & checkout with special thanks to the Front office Manager Lakshitha who was very informative about the services offered and organized everything for us. Tharindu we will never forget your sincere smile and the service. We were offered a lovely cake congratulating for our 6th wedding anniversary. The surprise birthday cake for my brother in law was also well presented and special thanks goes to the Restaurant & Bar Manager Thushara, Madu, Panditha and of course Chef Thilakaratne you are doing an amazing job to make sure the team is serving the best food and tirelessly looks into making a happy dining experience. We really loved the food and the variations (makes me wanna go back!) The ""yare tea"" at breakfast was something to remember and loved the variety of hoppers (yum ""pani appe"" after ages!) Of course we will come again. You will not regret a long stay over here with delectable food, easy access to the beach, 2 beautiful pools (loved the green pool), outdoor sauna, well equipped gym, and within close proximity to attractions like madu river safari, turtle hatchery, & less than an hours' drive to Galle.",positive

"Two of us stayed here for a business trip to this area. The staff are fantastic, friendly, courteous and ever helpful. The hotel itself is on a beach and the views are incredible. The Internet is not strong enough in the rooms, our mobile devices seemed to work but when trying to log in with computers it was a different story. The hotel was quiet, 1/3 of the rooms full yet the hotel still gave us two rooms above the karaoke that started at 8pm thru to midnight. We both moved room but not sure why the hotel would give these two rooms when the noise was so loud the walls were shaking. The restaurant was also a disappointment - cost wise was actually higher than some 5 star hotels in Colombo, and the quality not as good, as well as the restaurant under renovation and moved to a banquet room with no view - overall food was a disappointment.",negative

Rooms were comfortable, but had to be moved after first night because our so called de-luxe sea view room was situated immediately above the kitchen and dining rooms.

Restaurant and food were excellent with great choices every morning at breakfast and then again at dinner in the evening. Staff were very helpful and always with a smile. Service was slow in the restaurant. Bar staff were great. This is not a five star hotel, more between three and four.",neutral

Wonderful visit!,positive
"On our way from Colombo to Galle we stopped by this establishment without prior reservation. The grand driveway and facade of the Heritance Hotel where impressive at first sight. Having arrived there the good impression faded quickly. The room rate given at the reception was US-Dollar 140 per room without breakfast, which is expensive for the island, but we accepted without a written receipt. First of all we had to wait over 1 hour to get the room. By that time the dinner was about to finish, so we were advised to go to the restaurant where a buffet was presented. The quality of the dishes were far from higher standards. The room was alright, but nothing special. The hotel was crowded with tourist groups from China. The next morning by the tome of check-out a bill was presented of 280 US-Dollar. The chef concierge refused to get the man on duty from yesterday night. The outrageous room rate was ompared by us with rates shown on booking sites. The same night rooms had been available from 58 US-Dollar! After were rude discussions we left the hotel with a ""discount"" of 60 US-Dollar and paid incredible 220 US-Dollar. A never come back experience!",negative
"We have stayed at Heritance Ahungalla several times, and find its a lovely hotel with excellent food and great, courteous, helpful and friendly staff. The kids loved swimming in the pool, table tennis, badminton and the gym. As teenagers, they spent all their time outdoors. The live music at the bar had us on our feet dancing away! The wide range of food in all the buffet meals were delicious and we were even given a tour of the kitchen which was very interesting. We have enjoyed our stay here, I would recommend it to all my friends in Melbourne :)",positive

However on checkout much confusion with bills being mixed up within our tour group. This took about 45 minutes to sort out and when the cashier was asked for proof of purchase, he had to fish the receipts from the bin. This system needs an overhaul to ensure correct bills are billed to the correct person. Would definitely stay here again.",negative

"After visiting the sister hotel in dambulla, I had high expectations for customer service. However I was sadly disappointed apart from a very few members of staff. We arrived after touring Sri Lanka for our honeymoon for a rew days relaxation by the beach.. Dispite the local security we were often harrassed by the local ""beach boys"". A stroll on the beach was anything but relaxing. Although not a private beach the constant calling and shouting at by the locals was very annoying. Even after explaining we were on our honeymoon we were still surrounded by a number of the locals. Obviously this is made worse by the lack of security at the hotel, which allows locals to stroll around even to the resident only pool. After on evening sitting for a pre dinner drink I noticed a number of flis around and which point my husband pointed the food and liquid on the adjacent table. After letting the staff know and expecting a prompt clean up, nothing was done about the mess. In comparison to other hotels within this chain and other hotels we stayed at the hotel was not well maintained. I never saw anyone clean the main lobby and bar areas dispite obvious mess. In fact e only time I say a brush was during a lunchtime of heavy rain to brush the water out and this was only done once. There is a lack of information provided by the hotel. This could easily be rectified by adding a little more information into the room guide. Information about the surrounding area, places to visit and information about food within the restaurant. The hotel food however was of brilliant quality. We enjoyed a meal at the fine dining restaurant and can say this food would not have been out of place at any top london restaurant. The food at the the al a carte restaurant was also of a good standard. The evening buffet was expensive and so we avoided this as we felt it would be poor value and probably poor service what experience we had of breakfast. Now breakfast was a terrible fair, although a wide selection of food not enough waiters or chefs. We came down for breakfast at various times, but noticed if we came after 9.30 no one was around to provide tea or coffee or chefs to cook the food. If we came earlier it was so busy we had to queue for the dishes and the cold foods we're not refilled often enough. Rooms were of a good size and clean. However try to get a room a reasonable distance from the lobby as this can be noisy especially on the weekend. All in all this hotel has the basis for being lovely. The food was good, the views gorgeous, just a little more customer service and focus would improve anyone's experience massively. Maybe the staff here should vist kanadlama or the tea factory for some tips!",negative
The property is located in a great location and really easy to access. The bawa architecture is well preserved and presented. The pocket gardens maintained within the property is really nice.

"I was attending a wedding held on 20th December 2014 and a friend of mine and I had decided to stay at Heritance. Coming from the UK I was keen to stay close to the wedding venue and enjoy the supposed five star luxury that this hotel boasted to offer. My friend a resident of Sri Lanka arranged the accommodation some five months in advance for us to stay from 19 Dec till 21 Dec, using Booking.com. However upon arrival, they didn't have our booking for 19 only 20. Some 45 minutes, emails and phone calls later I was given a room based on half board. The room itself was large and nice. A bit dark in decor but view of sea front was nice. The hotel is large however there is no clear indication of how the rooms are numbered on each floor. There is according to the member of staff showing me to my room a north and South wing again this is not indicated visibly so it's easy to get lost. The entrance of the hotel is stunning however the rest of the hotels falls in comparison. For four hours I was without WIFI, a number of phone calls later a staff member turns up and fiddles with my phone including switching my phone off airplane mode connecting me to my UK service provider and leaving me with a £40.00 data roaming fee whilst still not realising that the Wifi was an issue with the hotel and not my phone. After trying to relocate me to a new room much smaller with a terrible view I eventually head in hands and eyes filled with tears of frustration and tiredness, was placed in a more pleasant room with a bigger balcony that over looked the sea and the wedding venue. The sliding door which acts as a blackout was unable to fully close because the side table was too big. I had to move this in order for the blackout to fully close. The air conditioner controls were broken in all three rooms so I had to use my nails to switch off the air conditioner. The shower cubicle was placed in such a away that you had to get in close the door before turning shower on. The hotel toiletries were poor - the shower gel and shampoo were all placed in bottles that were not sealed and the soap was well rather useless. There were also no small hand towels or towels big enough to dry hair with. All in all two large bath towels and two hand towels. No bath robes either to sit and relax in. A basic I feel for a hotel claiming to be five star. The mini bar of the last room was broken and had never been checked so we found the drinks warm mouldy and in drinkable. The cost of a glass of wine in comparison to the bottle found in the mini bar also made no sense. It was cheaper in the mini bar. The dining room (only one restaurant in this hotel) was dark and dismal. The hot food area was hard to find until further inspection. The food was ok. A very basic selection. Nothing fancy or elaborate. The bar area outside by entrance was far more prettier yet the service was poor. Morning breakfast in the same dining room was a very dark and gloomy affair. The decor and seating was so basic and dark that you just didn't want to eat in there. The only blessing was the guest relations officer Shanika who was so lovely and ever so eager to ensure we were happy that she went out of her way to do everything to make us feel at ease. We were on exit served with a $200.00 a night bill which I had to question over and over again. I am really sad to say that it was really shocked and disappointed by everything I had witnessed at this ""luxury"" hotel and having had a thorough read of what is expected to meet the international standards of a five star hotel - this to me is just a glorified bed and breakfast. Having experienced five star luxury and also other ratings of hotels I think I have had better staying in a cheap bed and breakfast in Brighton for far less the price tag. I can't say I would recommend this hotel to anyone and would recommend those that work hard for their money go look elsewhere.",negative

"This hotel is a 5 star hotel, I say that because of its high standards and of the the high hospitality of the staff no matter how good the hotel structure or the rooms are if the service is not good the hotel is never good but in this hotel the rooms food and the pools are up to the standards but the service is more than our expectations so I recommend this hotel to everyone.",positive
"Ceylan (Sri Lanka) is astonishing! Unfortunately this seaside hotel was the worse in our journey around Sri Lanka. Even if it's classified 5 stars, on reality it is not. The hotel needs a huge renovation ( a must for the 80's superb architecture from very well known Sri Lanka architect), the cleanliness could be much better and the staff (almost all of them very friendly) should have better management and be more professional. Even though ( even next time going visit Ceylan is better booking and hotel north of Colombo, because is near the cultural and forest tours), the stay was relaxing and, for a change at the far east beaches, there were 26º C 3 meter waves to brake....",neutral
"A unique hotel, great service, but it’s getting old and needs work Whilst the room (suite) was large and well appointed, the bathroom in particular needs renovation. It’s just getting old and needs work. In particular the shower over a massive spa bath would be very difficult for someone unsteady on their feet to get into - apart from holding on to the glass shower screen there was nothing to hold on to. There was areas of the hotel obviously no longer used, an upstairs bar above reception was empty, the locked billiards room, and the empty kids club were all looking sad and unloved. With some investment in the rooms and some public areas this hotel could easily beat the new chain hotels springing up",neutral
"It was only because of the hotels staff that my 2 nights stay here from being a horrible one to a very good experience. We checked in very late one evening and were given rooms above the coffee shop grill which meant that the rooms were full of the grill seafood smoke. A few minutes inside the rooms we started feeling like grilled fish ourselves. Upon request for room change we were told that the hotel was full and our request thus denied. Dinner at the coffee shop was a pretty sad affair too. The chicken that we were served was so hard that I am sure if I'd thrown it at a passerby that person would get hurt. After a stroll on the beach when we came to our rooms past midnight we realized that there was no water supply in the rooms due to some maintenance work and that it'd be restored around 2 am. That too did not happen. Our arms full of woes we met the Resident Manager Sampath De Silva and were surprised that he offered no arguments but only an apology. From that point onwards our stay turned into heaven. Mr Sampath offered to change our rooms and the staff went out of their way to be helpful, courteous and friendly. I'd particularly like to mention manager Praveen from the restaurants who made sure that the fare that was served to us was excellent. I'd recommend that future travellers take advantage of an exclusive special table d' hote that they arrange on the beach. The experience is put of the world.",negative

"The property is old and there was construction happening in the restaurant area. Only one restaurant was open during our stay and the Ala Carte had nothing much to write home about. The hotel does not have any facilities on the beach (no beach chairs etc.) and the beach seemed completely dry with very few tourists during our stay. Breakfast had a good range though. Rooms look old and the bathroom had strange blinds which did nothing for privacy. Not sure what I missed. Staff told me they get lot of German and Chinese tourists but I couldnt really imagine why anyone will choose to stay here rather than Bentota. Maybe during the season it is more vibrant, we unfortunately did not feel the vibrancy.",neutral

"The first thing that hits you is the chaos that reigns at the reception. It takes 30 mins to check us in . We were desperate for lunch.So at 2.30 the coffee shop seemed like a good option. But instead of quick service we were greeted by rude staff and poor service. The rice n curry we ordered was cold. Took them 25 mins to serve cold food. They did try n make up for it at their main restaurant. We were told ""you just name it and we will make it"". The buffet spread is vast.Vegetarian dishes they are yet to master.what they cook up as Indian fare falls woefully short.A quick rethink is needed here. Being a resort by the sea side, Heritance could have been exciting but alas the only thing that they provide is the sea! No water sports.No beach based activity. The staff is overworked. Its a mela out there. Bentota could be a better option with many hotels and resorts to choose from.Also it is the hub for water sports.",negative
"Отель достаточно старый и скучный. В море у отеля купаться нельзя, очень сильные течения и огромные волны. Всю ночь стоит грохот от волн, разбивающихся о камни. Совершенно не дружелюбный персонал.

"In terms of service, this is the worst experience we've had so far :D. I travelled through over 40 countries, and nowhere did I see the personnel so chilled - but not in a good way :) Restaurant & bar team easily forgets your order, and even when they don't, you can wait for a simple coffee in a bar with 2 tables occupied for over 0.5 hour. They graciously add someone else's drinks to your bill (8 glasses of wine instead of actual 2? easy!) Moreover, some of them literally beg for tips, and when you tip them, it doesn't mean the service becomes any better. I had a birthday on the first night of our stay, but the reception forgot to inform the restaurant, so we went to ask for a candle. On the same evening we asked for refill of water, coffee and tea in the room (we didn't get a refill on that day, so we called the reception to ask for it as they themselves advised us to do), but instead a boy came with a brewed coffee charged extra... The room keys didn't work on one day, so we had to go all the way back to the reception to then be escorted back to the room by the maintenance guy who spent quite some time fixing the issue. Oh, and as for maintenance, you simply can't be left in peace here - e.g., laundry man barbarically opens your door even with the DND sign on... Last but not least, on arrival, my bank card didn't work, while on the check-out it did. Quite strange. Luckily we had another card. Will I recommend this hotel? Not really. Maybe only for 1-night stay to enjoy the beauty of nature. But if you want nice service and a proper care you would expect for this price, avoid this place. :)",negative
"Nothing five star about this hotel. That doesn’t mean it’s terrible, it just doesn’t do what it says on the tin. We should’ve realised when we saw the deal we got. However, blissfully unaware we departed for what was meant to be a 5* hotel in Sri Lanka. From the start things went wrong. I didn’t understand how a hotel with 5* reviews on Tripadvisor could be so different to reality. But, what they do is they hand out cards asking you to rate them 5*, i presume most oblige as if you don’t they repeatedly ask you and get a “bit” irritated if you don’t. Unpleasant and unnecessary and not something you would ever experience in a 5* resort. Room: Our first room smelled like an ash tray, for two non smokers this was just an immediate no. After we said we wanted a new room they looked frustrated, but acknowledge the smell. Seemingly they wanted us to just ‘get on with it’. I don’t know if a 5* hotel which permits smoking indoors, especially with private terraces available. Finally we moved rooms (having to unpack / repack). Our second room had a broken AC, which in 32 degree heat was also unacceptable. After two nights of no sleep, 5 complaints about the AC and being told “it’s fine”, we finally moved to a third room. The AC worked and the room was much larger, an upgrade we thought. However, after the first night it was all clear. We were next to the maintenance and cleaning room, so at about 6.30-7am every morning we were woken up by the sound of trolly wheels on the stone floor. It is so loud that you don’t stand a chance of sleeping through. Initially they don’t turn down the bed and don’t give you the water they promise. The upside of the rooms are the large and comfy beds, and our room housekeeper (Rukhal) was good and left funny towel shapes (monkeys, dogs etc). Poolside: the pools are great, we spent most of our days by the green pool. Lots of space and a nice atmosphere. However, they don’t clear up so following morning you will find yesterdays banana skins, glasses etc. Quite disgusting. We ended up clearing up ourselves. Staff: some great members of staff, highlight was definitely Waruna. Seemingly the only trained and wanting to please member of staff. The rest don’t want to be there and expect to be greated with eye rolls and attitude even when ordering food. You feel like you’ve inconvenienced them at great length. Try ordering a cappuccino at breakfast and you’ll know what I mean. Especially when you get a cold one and ask for a hot one. Three people will try to tell you to drink it and then dip a finger in when you say it’s cold. Going the extra mile certainly doesn’t come naturally. Another upside was when the guest relations manager walked around asking for feedback. We shared our experience and things improved, that evening our bed was turned down, more water was given and pool was improved. It lasted merely one day though. Also, one member of staff in the restaurant wears an unsightly net vest! I think he is trying to be funny. Seems unhygienic and out of place. The hotel is filled with staff but they are untrained and only do one job e.g open door, fill water (no other beverage) so you end up waiting a long time. They also take your food away from you before you have finished and give you bill before you are ready. Stressful, to say the least. Food: the local food is great, especially the Dahl. Lots of food available and we can’t complain. Not 5* but still very good. Facilities: they claim to have several bars and restaurant but there aren’t, or at least not in use. They also have mould in several areas, cracks and paint chipping. The toilets don’t have soap and are often untidy. Spa: fab! Loved it and worth a visit. Entertainment: avoid! Hotel should stick to the live music. The shows and plays ruin what would be a romantic evening with your other half. Overall: despite all this, we had a great holiday, but that was down to my husband and I laughing about it all and making the most of it. I would even recommend this place to others, but with the caveat - you get what you pay for. It’s a firm 3*. WiFi is also fab! Tip: visit some of the local restaurants on the beach! Great food. Also, stay away from ocean - strong currents and big waves. Can be very dangerous and if red flag is up your insurance won’t cover any accidents. Don’t forget to check your bill, they say 50% off but don’t give it to you unless you remind them. Expect an eye roll and potentially an argument before it happens.",negative

"We were there for two days ie 06 and 07 Dec. Let me objectively articulate the good thinga and things which needs improvement: Good ones 1. Well kept resort with private access to the beach 2. Huge open swimming pool which from the reception provides an illusion as if the pool is merging into the sea..a visual delight 3. Nice rooms with a balcony and I was told all rooms were sea facing Areas for improvement: 1. The access to the beach or otherwise ia uncontrolled ie no real security or barricade ..there were outsiders/ touts soliciting business and no one controlled them. 2. Most guests were Europeans and no wonder ..the entire menu was made to cater to their preferences barring a few local items 3. The menu for both dinner and breakfast practically remained unchanged thru our stay 4. Though the staff and chef were helpful, they probably had little clue about Indian dishes / ingredients/ taste. Despite their beat effort to provide one odd dish especially for us, the food experience was far from satisfactory. So if you are Indian and crave for Indian food ...this ia not the place for you. In contrast, all other places we stayed in SriLanka ie Kandy, Nuwara Eliya or Colombo, there were some Indian dishes on offer and some of them tasted good too. 4. Lastly , despite making a special request for cake/ flowers for our anniversary and reminding that very morning again, they messed it all up. Finally with the intervention of our travel agent they did bring a cake but by then the damage was done. It also gave me a feeling that they are probably still under slave mindset of licking the white skun. Thus on balance, 3 to 3.5 stars is what I will give",neutral

A hotel that has an impeccable service and warmth about it. From the time you enter to the time you leave the staff will make you feel so at home. Filled with smiles and excellent service 24/7. A wonderful atmosphere with an infinity pool to die for. However i would like to give some constuctive feedback to the hotel management with regard to food. As a five star resort i expected the food on weekdays to be what i would say awesome. But i was disappointed to see the buffet was average. It didnt make me say wow and the dishes were predictable each time i came to the buffet as i stayed 3 nights. I was surprised to hear the hotel has an award winning chef. However it did not reflect so with the cuisine. The silver food containers were very hard to open and close. The buffet should be more colorful and the dessert needs to have variety as i have experienced in other five star hotels in sri lanka. The hotel didnt have a tea/coffee buffet for the evening tea. (As advised by the staff when inquired). Other hotels provide these services for full board guests. The tea in the room is not that pleasant due to the creamer tasting weird with tea. So they need to have a tea corner as well. Next time i return to the hotel i wish see this as a five star hotel to its fullest and not only to the star count. Dinuk Weerasekara (Sri Lanka),neutral

Only one towel in room until more brought at 6pm which was a bit late. Toiletries supplied very poor, bathroom needed a good clean. Found the buffet to be disappointing and dishes not refilled very often also one night the vegetables were very undercooked, also little choice. Breakfast buffet good.

"This is a first class hotel right on the beach. Very spacious well equipped rooms, beautiful grounds and 2 large pool. Nice restaurant with Buffett but was lacking the choices we had experienced elsewhere in Sri Lanka. The family members I travelled with like a cocktail before dinner but less than half the cocktails listed on the menu were unavailable. They had no limes in a country that has heaps of citrus fruit. We stayed a few nights and still no limes at the end. Only a small thing but I’m sure they could have bought some just outside the resort.",neutral
"From most of the reviews here and because of the generally good reputation of Heritance hotels we had high expectations for our stay here. This was the last part of our Sri Lankan trip before returning to Colombo and the plan was to relax and enjoy a luxury hotel along a beautiful beach. The beach was beautiful but the hotel was disappointing. Pros: -Beautiful beach-clean, not crowded. -Decently appointed room with large balcony. -Wifi that worked well. -Lovely reception area and infinity pool. Cons: -Room floor was sandy, bathroom mats with dirt smudges. -Bad housekeeping service. After being out all morning our room still wasn't cleaned - I called and asked to have it done right away while we were at lunch. They finally arrived while we were napping three hours later. -Broken minibar never repaired or replaced, after we requested -Breakfast buffet restaurant -Very strong moldy/mildewy smell permeates. Buffet adequate but not great. Chaotic atmosphere and spotty-to-bad service. -Hall noise (many children in hotel during our stay) -Noise from pool area - music at night, exercise activity in pool mid-morning Altogether there were too many things wrong with this stay. Disappointing for what is touted as a five star hotel. We would not return or recommend.",negative

"This was our third time at the hotel. We were married on the beach when the hotel was the Triton, visited again on our 10th anniversary and have just returned from our third trip there. The hotel is as lovely as ever and makes for a really relaxing holiday in a beautiful setting. There are plenty of opportunities for excursions to see more of this fantastic country but it's also lovely to relax by the pools or wander along the stunning beach, especially at sunset. The staff throughout the hotel were excellent; from the reception staff at check-in, the restaurant staff, waiters, pool staff ... All were very helpful, friendly and gave a great service throughout our stay. We booked on an all inclusive basis and the food was always very good and plentiful. The staff also arranged a romantic 4-course meal on the beach for us which was superb. Would thoroughly recommend the hotel and we are already planning our next trip back there! Thanks to all the staff who helped make our holiday so enjoyable.",positive
"We had bee here in 2002 and 2004 upon arrival having booked a suite it was full of Mosquitos we booked A I went for dinner inedible the wine was just terrible! We went to remember the 10 anniversary of the Tusnami , when we were there. It was a huge dissapointment! It was with regret we had to complain. After a meeting with the general manager every thing changed, we renegotiated the AI do not do it! We re started on B&B it all changed. It is NOT the standard hotel it was, it is with regret I have to say this, the horribly black dinning room! On we go the sun beds are so unbelievably bad they aren't describable , when you see the staff wheeling one wheel with the other on the top ready to stick it back on, residents having to use just the pads on the floor as they don't have enough beds and lying on the grass infested with ants. There are so few umbrellas when yo leave your bed they have to move them for other residents , this is a 2 star or less and I really hate to gave to give this review , but I as an experienced well travelled Sri Lankan tourist I'm so sorry to say I will not be returning. Also to add the beach sellers who I had known since 2002 and have supported. Even to getting a sewing machine funded are the most intense in all our travels they drove us to distraction ! No we won't ever go back and this leaves me with a sad heart on my live of my beloved island",negative
"It was an overall disappointing stay at Heritance Ahungalla. The hotel was fully booked during our stay, given the holiday season. The hotel staff was very nice and friendly. It is an old building and definitely needs maintenance, particularly the rooms. For a 5-star property, the room is small, and the toilet hardly has any space in it, which is not what you'd expect given the star category this hotel boasts about and when compared to other similar 5-star hotels and resorts in Sri Lanka. The quality of the extra bed in the triple room would possibly befit a 2 or 3 star hotel. On the other hand, the king bed in the room was very comfortable, and one of the pluses was the sea view from the room, which was amazing. The food lacked variety and if you are a vegetarian, stay away from Heritance Ahungalla. They simply don't cater to those needs, even if you make a special note of it. The lunch buffet was the worst of the three meals we had. This was brought to the attention of the chef and the restaurant manager, and they were most apologetic, but it was an overall bitter experience in the end at Heritance Ahungalla. On the contrary, the desserts were superb and delicious. Overall, our stay did not offer any value for money, so I would never visit or recommend this hotel.",negative

If you want a large hotel with conference facilities this would be a good choice. However if you want a 5 star luxury hotel look elsewhere. The hotel is noisy the rooms decidedly past their use by date. The location is a problem with limited local facilities. Taking a walk was a hassle both on the beach and in the village. The main buffet restaurant is extremely tired. The one saving grace are the staff who are really excellent.,negative

"Disappointing Dining Experience at Ahungalla Heritance I had high expectations when visiting Ahungalla Heritance (part of the Aitken Spence chain), but the food quality was a major disappointment. The lunch buffet was underwhelming, with most dishes lacking salt and flavor. The fried rice, made with samba rice, was a poor choice and didn’t complement the rest of the dishes at all. Tea-time snacks were no better—minimal variety and nothing appetizing or memorable. We even raised our concerns with the chefs, but unfortunately, there was no noticeable improvement. For a reputed hotel chain, the dining experience was far below standard. I hope the management takes this feedback seriously and works on upgrading their food quality and variety.",negative
"We arrived at the hotel after almost 20 hours by plane and found out that espresso coffee is a special coffee and will have to pay, although it has the same taste and in no case was an espresso. I mention that we had an all-inclusive supplement and the coffee was included First Breakfast: i wanted an omelette I asked the chef to prepare ""well done"", but he became visibly irritated because I have explained in more detail. He said something in his language, evading after I asked him what he said. I inspected the room where I was staying and found that under the bed were traces of visible dust probably old before those who have been staying here previously, the bathroom is not the bathroom of a 5stars hotel. The towels are to used and have old stains. On the ceiling we discovered traces of mosquito / dead flies on the ceiling of the bathroom The beach behind the hotel filled with annoying vendors that are allowed by the security agents even inside of the hotel property limit. We found the waiters mostly unprepared, lazy and disinterested. At the pool if you order a drink lasts an eternity. In fact, if you order anything in this hotel last an eternity. The food at dinner buffet is an ordinary cantine and you can easily see that they recycle the food from evening to another or is the same food. The concept of all inclusive is a joke, because there are only a few types of local drinks and those bad. Beach towels are to used and have old stains. We chose the restaurant ""fine dining"", but the disappointment continued. We first drink comes after 15 minutes, and the food was brought after an hour of waiting and although you must have 15 / discount due prepaid package of all inclusive, we were charged 100 / requires that the next day to ask for explanations, explanations that reduced bill. However, the food is typical of a normal restaurant. Not bad, but nothing special. I have to mention that in the fine dining restaurant were only 2 tables with people. It was empty! The new years evening was ok, but we wanted to order champagne and they told us they are out of stock. We wanted Moet, they gave us Mumm. How can you not have stocks of champagne for New Years Eve? The food was very good. If this have been the food for all the holiday i could have forgot all the other things At 14.30 in the nect day the room was not cleaned in the context in which We left at 9 am the room. I ordered a soft drink included in all-inclusive package, it was added to the bill and replaced at the my request. Conclusion: if you're not careful pay twice. Wishing to relax at the beach we waited 30 minutes for the staff to find sun beds towels. Another breakfast: I asked two omelets ( for me and my husband) everything OK, I asked him and the third omelets for my son and the cook was getting nervous. The adventure continues... For sure the hotel management will have a respond to this post, but it will not make any difference , because my new years eve holiday was ruined, so I recommend you avoid this hotel that can be classified as no more than one 4-star hotel!",negative

"We spent 3 weeks in Sri Lanka and stayed in 12 hotels and this we ranked last at number 12. On arrival our room was not ready despite it had gone 14:00. We were told this was due to a late check out and we were made to wait at reception without any offer of a refreshment. We reserved a table for evening food and upon arriving at the reserved time the table had been given to another group. We received phone calls on both mornings waking us up. One was at 07:30 regarding some washing being ready for us despite not having any done. The laundry department were insistent it was ours and then Hung up when we told them it was not. When we tried to speak to management we had to ask three times and after 10hrs we got to speak to a manager. They heard our complaint and offered half price food for the evening as a good will gesture. The buffet was on par with other hotels and the restaurant food was very good. Unfortunately despite the managers efforts at departure time we were phoned regarding when to collect our bags. We asked for 10 minutes time which they said they could do. After 25 minutes we walked our own luggage to reception and left the hotel in the same style we arrived, little to no service. During our visit some of the facilities were shut despite the hotel supposedly being fully booked. The room was fine and clean but the communal areas looked tired and not what was expected from a 4 Star hotel. The restaurants lacked soul and character. Due to our experience I can not recommend this hotel and I would question the awards and endorsements it has. I hope that others receive better service than we did given the price.

"I was a part of a team coordinating a wedding to be held at Heritance Ahungalle on Saturday 20th Dec. All plans were in place and all of us in the coordinating team were moving ahead with the game plan when we got to know that the furniture supplier had messed up the order. Needless to say that all hell broke loose while we tried to work out an alternate solution, it was a mere 3 hours before the wedding ceremony. A lot of stress, tension and heart stopping moments later the furniture arrived at 3.00 pm, we had to set up and decorate 30 tables in 1 1/2 hours - guest were due to arrive at 4.30 pm. The team at Heritance Ahungalle, stepped up to the occasion, they deployed additional crew to unload and set up furniture and get it all going to ensure that the wedding set up was ready on time. Their attitude was fantastic - it was a case of everyone working together to give the couple a wedding to remember. The result was fantastic, everything was set up and ready for the wedding with mere moments to spare and it all looked brilliant. It was a result of brilliant cooperation, understanding and adrenaline. No one entering that marquee would have realised the tension we all had to work through - the set up looked stunning and the couple said that it was more than what they expected. What's important is that it was not the responsibility of the hotel to do all this and we in the coordinating crew know that if not for the team at Heritance Ahungalle lead by their F&B Manager Gamini we would not have been to get it all together on time for our clients and give them the wedding of their life.

"We just got back from Ahungalla one of 3 hotels we stayed at in Sri Lanka, we spent the first few days of our holiday travelling around and then 4 nights here. Quite frankly I cannot believe the rubbish some nit pickers write on here. The hotel is amazing, the setting is gorgeous and the staff are the friendliest we met. All the staff are very well trained and could not help us enough very approachable. The room was clean and kept clean daily by housekeeping who did an outstanding job. The A/C worked wonders and our room was a constant cool haven from the outside temperatures. We were on a half board basis and ate every day at the resturant. I found the variety good and my husband enjoyed all the local dishes, even on a day when i couldnt find a meal to my taste the kitchen prepared me something just for me. We were completely content in the hotel and only left once for a small shopping trip. I haved stayed in a variety of hotels in other countried but this was my first time to Sri Lanka, I was unsure what to expect but was completely happy with my hotel choices and the country a fab holiday.",positive

"As we pulled up outside the entrance to this hotel we were amazed at the view. We were looking forward to some relaxing days. We were shown to our room which was disappointing. It had a poor view and the shower was in need of some good quality cleaning products, with the grouting all black and the glass door was covered in limescale. We were so unhappy and disappointed (this was the third hotel in the group that we've stayed at on this trip) that we asked to be moved to a different room. This was facilitated but we had to wait almost two hours for the replacement room to be ready. This room had a much better outlook and whilst the grouting was cleaner, there was still the same issue with the shower door. Some good limescale remover used regularly would work wonders. That said, the overall cleanliness of the room was very good. The room cleaning service was always good and the guys couldn't have been more helpful. The pool and gardens are nice and the staff at the pool were very good. On one occasion a man was in difficulty in the pool having wandered out of his depth, and the lifeguard on duty leaped to his aid. A happy ending. Don't be too worried if you see chipmunks and land monitors passing by. Perhaps even the occasional monkey. We found the service at the pool bar to be friendly but quite slow, with some staff, on occasion, preferring to stand and chat together. We ate in the outdoor restaurant twice and found the food to be pretty awful. After those poor experiences we ate in the buffet restaurant. I wish I could be more positive but I can only be honest - the evening meals were not up to the level of that at the previous hotel at which we'd stayed. We found many dishes overcooked and almost cold. At the dessert bar, only half the items were labelled, and if you went to eat after the main rush it felt like we were being given the leftovers. The whole presentation was lacklustre. The staff though, were very nice and friendly and the service good, though some worked harder than others. I feel this establishment would benefit greatly from more staff training and motivation.",negative

"We were a group of 10 adults (couples) and this property was part of our itinerary. The minute we entered the property, we were in awe of it but thats it. Our problems began right from the word Go. Our check-in process took almost an hour which ideally should have been a 5 minute job since our passport copies and all details were with the agent and hotel. Post the checkin, our ordeal just began to rear its head. Of the 5 rooms we were provided, 3 of them were with twin beds when it was clear to the hotel that were were couples. Then further, of the 5 rooms, 2 of them were side corner rooms which were nowhere near the deluxe rooms as shown on the website. The plumbing and the lighting too wasn't in order. On asking for a room change, the manager on duty just told that this is all that is available. With absolutely no remorse on settling us for subpar rooms. This is surely not how a 5 star property treats its guests. Thank god I stayed just 1 night. The room service was pathetic and they took almost an hour to get to us since the mini bar was completely empty. What I liked about the property was the various activities, the food and the variety. I liked the proximity to the beach but I just hope the property gets their act together, have proper signboards on each floor and get better processes in place.",negative

"Booked this hotel as part of our tour of sri lanka , it was the last one having stayed in 4 other hotels .Recommended to us and overall it was a nice hotel but let it self down in certain areas. Arrival was pleasant and we had a slight delay before going to the room , which was very nice spacious but in need of some improvements . wardrobe doors did not close on the runners , blinds in the bathroom had no function to close them , did report to reception but nothing done . Pool area very nice always able to get a sun lounger two pools available and the attendants were first class in providing towels and arranging the beds for you . Staff in the restaurants and bar areas were also first class being both attentive and professional. Only down side the evening was based around the pool and i feel they need to provide a better more comfortable seating arrangement instead of the same seating for the daytime pool drinking and eating tables and chairs . food and drink was good with a good choice and selection . beach is lovely but quiet due to , beach sellers and men pushing their taxi business which disrupts the relaxing environment , they stay behind a line of flags but it is close to the sun loungers. overall this is a nice hotel and nice beach side location nothing outside the resort if you go B+B then you must eat in the hotel which can work out expensive . The let down for us was the last day , most flights out of sri lanka are late evening , we were due to be collected at 21.30 . The room had to be vacated at 12.00 ( no late room available ). At 12.00 which was embarassing a member of the reception team came and cut off the all inclusive bands when we were with other guests. this is the first hotel which stopped the all inclusive many hours before we left . also if you want that shower prior to departing then they wont provide a room , we had to shower in the pool shower which is also the toilet nowhere to hang clothes or dry your hair . this was a disappointment to me which let the experience of the hotel down and which in my opinion stopped it being classed as a 5 Star , the sri lankan people were great i will return again but not to this hotel , i did read the reviews and thought i could ignore the beach sellers but it did spoil it . couple in our 40's",neutral

"We visited on 19th December we were a group of 7 adults and 3kids we received a warm welcome and it was a very busy day to fount office. All three meals were very good kids also enjoyed as well as us and rooms are also good and clean... we have booked 2 double rooms and a one triple room, But they don't have triple rooms they only give a extra bed for the third person... Wen they fixed the third bed it was a tragedy! none of us can sleep on that bed because it was a very small folding bed. I have never seen a extra bed like that in my life. we have visited many star class hotels, and we always booking a triple room as we are travelling with our mother. I have never seen such a small extra bed.... When we ask about this from the hotel they told us this is the size of a extra bed they provide. That bed is good for a kid not for a adult... I'm very very disappointed...But I couldn't let any one to sleep on that bed I barely manage that bed so didn't had a good sleep... It was a sleep less night.

Stayed here for three nights and loved it. Great staff Always willing to go the extra mile and so very friendly. Even the gardening staff always smiling. Room fabulous overlooking the smaller pool which was an added bonus. Food special. Had buffet for breakfast and dinner.,positive
"During our tours of the country, we had dropped in to this hotel as a family several times in passing over the years for lunch etc (excellent experiences) and finally took the opportunity to stay few nights this year. As always, the famous GB architecture in the reception area was fabulous, staff were very helpful courteous. There were some issues with the online booking system where the exact facilities in each type of room was not clear but the staff on the night managed to sort things out satisfactorily for us, even with the hotel being near full occupancy. The room we stayed in was clean and modern (appeared to be a recent refurbishment, the multi-socket wall powerpoints took in my overseas devices without the need for an adapter!), room service was good, Wi-Fi excellent, the gym smallish but adequate, pool & beach areas great and there were some good traditional outdoor displays/ activities during local New Year celebrations. Overall, a good experience & would be even better if the online system and a few minor maintenance needs were to be tidied up by the hotel group.",positive

"We stayed at this hotel for five days from the 13-18 February, in a superior room, on the ground floor overlooking the gardens with a partial sea view. From arrival it was apparent that the room had a stale smell that had been unsuccessfully masked by the cleaning staff using cloves to hide the odour.In general terms the rooms are large,although extremely outdated by the original 1980's décor. Limited attempts have been made to upgrade the bathroom by the replacement of the original sanitary ware. Although bare plaster,binding door,pop-up wastes that do not seal negate part of this exercise. The restaurant prides itself on the training of its Chefs,although has considerable difficulties in balancing the menu to provide a mixture between eastern and western food.There is little provision for some travellers who may not want to eat Sri Lankan food for the whole of their holidays. This was mentioned on more than one occasion to the Assistant Sous Chef,and The Sous Chef,who provided a detailed tour of the Kitchen,although no indication why the menu is so one sided. The restaurant is open between 7-10 pm,when we arrived at 8.30 pm most of the salad trays where empty and had not been replaced. The one European dish,pasta, had two spoonfuls of ""penna"" left in the tray. When we queried this with the Assistant Sous Chef he asked what we would like to eat?,and this could be prepared for us.I also noted that many of the dessert trays where empty and would be withdrawn and not replaced,normally at 8.45pm. At this time the restaurant is open for a further 1Hours and 15 minutes. I really would expect better from a 4*-5* hotel.",neutral
"Having read some fantastic reviews of this hotel, we arrived with high expectations. Twice prior to arrival we had reqested a room with a sea view and a double bed. On arrival however we were asked if we wanted to upgrade before even seeing the room, therefore, it came as no suprise that we had neither a sea view nor a double bed as requested. Now I appreciate the hotel was very busy over the Sri Lankan New Year however we had booked well in advance and were assured that within two days we would be moved, which did not materialise despite constant pleas, until day 7 of 10! Agreed the hotel was very clean and in a fantastic location, however, if you are looking for something intimate and romantic this is not the place for you. The beach is beautiful though the hawkers provide little peace and are a constant menace and not to be trusted, given the stories we heard from trusted locals inland.",negative

"We spent 10 nice days at the Heritance Ahungalla in april 2015. To summarize, the stay was in general a good one. The setting is wonderful indeed. Spectacular beach. Great weather. The hotel as such is not bad at all. However, given the fact that it is supposed to be on the upper end, and that is has been designated the title Travelers Choice, we expected a lot more. This is more like a mid-range family resort. The good: Wonderful surroundings, sea view from the balcony, tasteful spacious rooms with a well-regulated AC. Great breakfast. Pretty good food quality in general. Friendly service. The headwaiter acted very professionally and listen very carefully and arranged adjustments when we complained about the buffé dinner. The Bad: Dinner is a Buffé, served in an environment reminding you of an elementary school. Let us say - not very cozy. They brag about their fine dining restaurant, which serves excellent lobster (hence, you should go there once) at a quite high price, but the rest is nothing special. Expect €40-50 for a bottle of wine anywhere in the hotel. It is a family resort. Some days the pool area is crowed with screaming kinds, despite that pool rules say: NO GAMES. The staff does nothing to moderate. Between the hotel and the beach there is an area with palms and bushes. In the shade, a dozen or so sales men and women do their best to attract the attention of the guests all day long. Hello, hello! Our plane departed late so our travel agent suggested that we should ask for a late check out. Initially the response sounded as if that most likely could be arranged, but somehow the hotel was fully booked on the Monday morning when we should leave, so we had to leave the room and take the shower in a cramped public shower with no shower gel and no space to leave your belongings. That was the end of a glamorous holiday. Well, maybe not. Suggestions to management: 1. Dinner: Try to do something about the elementary school dining room. Serve the Buffé twice at 19 and then again at 20:30. Make sure that the food is fresh all the time. 2. Mixing families and couples: You have two pools. Why not enforce strict quiet behaviour at either pool and let the kids play at the other. Everyone will be happy. 3. Public showering facilities: It is warm. People are the for swimming. Make sure they can take a shower in a respectable bathroom before they say goodbye. It will be the last impression they take with them back home as they say Au revoir.",neutral

"We stayed at this hotel for the first time back in the late 90s, when it was called Triton. By the way, the statue of this Triton still flaunts at the entrance. It was a marvelous, respectable hotel with several restaurants, a tea room, fine service, and two lovely swimming pools. This is a beautiful colonial-style building, inside there are very beautiful galleries, between which water flows, trees and flowers grow. This is real architecture, not a soulless block with rooms. Unfortunately, the hotel ended up under water in December, 2004. The staff will tell you that only the first floor was flooded, and they will lie. Typical tsunami traces will also be on the third floor, this can be seen, although the walls are being tinted. I don't really understand how they got 5 stars. It is a very sad sight of destruction and extinction. The hotel is a pity as an old horse, from which they are trying to squeeze out the remnants of strength. Unmown grass, peeling sun loungers, frayed beach towels, yellowed bath towels, stained old linen, squeaky air conditioner, mildew, dampness, musty. Tiles are falling off in pools. Fence-mesh around the perimeter. And that is not all. This once beautiful hotel is now used as a staging post for bus groups, arriving to spend one night before departure. From the pros: It is still an outwardly beautiful building The staff works with full dedication Decent cuisine for Europeans, not too spicy, many adapted dishes. In the room, like more than 20 years ago, a bowl of fresh seasonal fruits will be waiting for you. The staff is still on the ball.",negative
Not the nicest resort,negative
A good weekend,positive
"Our stay here cost about £180 per night for a double room. Overall the hotel is nice but just not really living up to the standards you'd expect of a 4 star hotel or the price tag. For example the toilets in the reception area were rather dark and needed a clean and tidy, there were lots of staff around but so many of them doing nothing and at one time I had to ask 5 different staff to order drinks over a period of about 20 mins before anything actually happened, a lot of the time the waiting staff seemed to just cluster in groups and were lost if actually asked to do anything. The cushions on the sun loungers were ancient, one of the things we noticed that should be easy to put right if the hotel put some of its profits back into the premises. The hotel makes a lot of its 'award winning' chefs which became a bit irritating after a couple of days as some food was great, some really not so good and I had the only stomach upset of the entire trip after eating at the hotel as did a couple of the family, I think due to food being reheated as some things looked rather familiar. Also they seemed thrown at breakfast if more than one or two people wanted the freshly cooked items such as hoppers so you had to wait absolutely ages or give up and have items that were not needing cooking - a real shame as I love my Dosa and hoppers! The kids club was good but the evening entertainment seemed to be the male ents team dressing in drag every night and miming to something and they seemed to abandon the kids pretty quickly if there was any sign of mingling with the grown ups. The other big downer for the hotel is the mosquitoes which are absolutely rife, not totally avoidable but I feel they could have made more of an effort with the rooms and common areas to minimise the mozzy numbers - as most of the other hotels we stayed in had done. Plus points were the two nice pools and the nice view of the sea. Without a fantastic rate to entice me back I'd be inclined to try somewhere else along the coast when I next go back.",neutral

"Arriving at this hotel, it looked rather impressive with its long entrance and infinity pool overlooking the beach and ocean. On closer consideration, expecting five star quality, I was surprised to see stagnant water in some of the fountains, the quality of the material used in the hallways of the hotel looked rather cheap and our room, while quite big and comfortable seemed kind of empty (as if some furniture had been removed or was mssing something). The hotel food was average (which was how I found most of the food during our stay in Sri Lanka). For the positive, we loved the beautiful beach, which was one of the highlights of our trip, the greenery surrounding the pool areas and the natural beauty of it all, was what finally made our stay quite enjoyable (as well as the geckos wandering around). To reiterate, our room was very comfortable, clean and quite large for the three of us, with a very nice, large bathroom. We had a balcony overlooking the pool area and we could hear the waves of the ocean (unfortunately as of the evening we could not leave the doors opened because of the mosquitos).",neutral

"For the layabout to do nothing, the fitness fanatic to be at peak, the gourmet to garner all the delights or the holiday maker in search of serenity, there is one place in Sri Lanka all rolled into one. That is the five-star Heritance at Ahungalla, where the blue ocean kisses the sand and the swimming pool stands between the airy reception area. This may sound like a leaf from a flyer or an advertisement. It is not. That’s my experience during a week-long stay at the luxury resort. The absence of what seems an orchestrated hustle and bustle in some of the resorts, being left alone from the taunting touts on the beach and caring of the staff made all the difference. I fell in love with what I saw and what I enjoyed. The buffet meals for breakfast, lunch and dinner had a wide variety to choose from – a cross section of the most popular Sri Lankan cuisine and a widespread selection of western and continental food. That is not to mention the fine dining restaurants. If you need to learn a little more, go beyond what the glossy magazines and flashy advertisements on websites say. I did that. The tins, bottles, corrugated boxes and other degradable items do not go waste. There is a team to sort them to be re-cycled. An award winning Chef, Dimuthi Kumarasinghe finds no space on the walls of his room or his tables to place any more awards including trophies. They are full. Ask him to give you what they call an “indigenous meal.” It’s a three course lunch or dinner with produce including catch of the sea within a radius of five kilometres from the hotel. I told Manager Refhan N. Razeen that I was pampered. “That is our style,” he said. So, if you also want to be pampered in southern Sri Lanka, Heritance is the resort. Don’t believe me. Have a go, try it.",negative

"Once again I'm back at Heritance Ahungalla and it is just as good as the first time, maybe even better. I came to the hotel with some buddies and had quite the bachelor pad.

stayed for five nights as a family of five and we enjoyed everything about the hotel. The long well maintained driveway and the large pond in front of the entrance. Everybody smiled and spoke to you and were all very happy. The reception when we arrived made you feel instantly welcome. Our rooms were first class clean tidy and well maintained. We were even visited by a tribe of monkeys playing around the walkways one morning. The dinning area and quality of food was excellent. The waiters were all experienced and very helpful. There are two swimming pools both of which were large and clean. The security staff kept the beach area quiet but you could approach the beach boys and banter with them and they all wanted to be your friend and guide. We had no qualms about using a couple of them as guides and these enhanced our experience of the area and the people. The only complaint I had were often the number of flys in the dinning area which was hard to stop due to the open plan design. The entertainment was low key but very fitting for the hotel and its location,positive

"When you arrive at this hotel you cannot help but be impressed. There is a large water feature outside reception and a lovely pool just inside. The rooms were pleasant but not great. When I got to the balcony the sea view was not quite what I imagined, the hotel is set a bit further back than it may appear in brochure photos. Found the staff very pleasant and the buffet choices quite expansive. The major disappointment were the cocktails on offer on the all inclusive. A couple off the Arrack based ones were OK but the others were pretty naff. Other AI's I have been to have a better range, although sometimes there is a small charge for the more expensive ones. Here it is full payment for non AI menu.",neutral
"Overall a very good hotel and staff were excellent. Some areas of the hotel were tired but everywhere was very clean. Rooms were comfortable and facilities good, with a reasonably well equipped gym and two large pool areas, where the attendants were helpful in providing towels and arranging beds. The food was very good however, our experience in the dining room was mixed, mainly because at the weekend, the hotel is open to non-residents, so there were suddenly huge numbers of extra diners for dinner on Saturday and breakfast on Sunday, which turned the experience into a bit of a bun fight. The quality of the food was still good, however the presentation was off putting as staff could not keep up with the volume and serving dishes were left messy and tables were not cleared as quickly as on other days. We ended up in the 'outside area' which felt very 'make shift' - perhaps this area should be made available for non residents so that residents at the hotel do not experience reduced standards at the weekend. On the plus side, there is a quieter residents only pool, so it is possible to escape during the day at the weekend. My advice would be to avoid weekends when the hotel is open to non-residents as it becomes far too busy and noisy, specifically in the dining area.",positive

"We stayed in Heritance Ahungalla for 16 nights. I want to structure the Review in positive, neutral and negative things and because everyone seems to tell just the positive things i start with the negative ones. Negative: - Dirty beach; the Hotel does not care about the litter on the beach. Of course it is a public beach but there are only Hotel guests. Thats why they should clean it more often. - Beach Boys: they wait in front of the beach and even whistle or shout for someone. You always feel observed when you lie on the pool - Rooms are in poor condition. In the shower is mould, the curtains are dirty and the furniture is old (i enclosed some Pictures). This is definitely not 5-star-hotel-like! - The Hotel customer Service asked if we could give them a good tripadvisor-rating and they want to see if you give 5 points. Thats certainly the fact why there are so many good Reviews. - The Prices in the Hotel (if you dont have AI) are quite high. A 0,3 Liter Diet-Coke is about 3 Dollar, the dinner 26 Dollar. Very much for a Country like Sri Lanka. - When you leave the Hotel there are some Tuk-Tuk-Driver who want to bring you to the next herbal-farm or wants to sell you drugs. After our second try, we did not dare to go out -The Bar staff was quite slow and we had to wait almost 15 minutes till someone cared. That happened many times. Neutral: - Loud Room: We had a room over the bar and the bass was quite loud till 11 p.m. But most other rooms which are further away are certainly quiet. When we told this to the front desk they immediately offered another room Positive: - The architecture of the Hotel and the beautiful pools. - The Housekeeping and almost every Hotel employee was extremely friendly - The animals in the Hotel. There where cute chipmunks, funny apes, lovely ravens taking their bath in the pool, a lizard and even a big snake (i dont know if it was poisonous) - great Food. I dont think that you can find any better Food in Sri Lanka I just rate the Hotel with two out of five because it is made much better on tripadivor than it is for real. In my opinion it is not better than a european 3-Star-Hotel and i know that sri-lanka-standard is far lower than european but unfortunately the Prices are not like Sri Lanka (Massage 1 hour- 100 Dollar!)",negative

"The good first - Hotel staff are all wonderful, helpful and the service slow but very friendly. The beachfront location is excellent. The food is good- even the buffet - which I normally dislike with a vengeance was above average, but the fining dining experience (lobster) was excellent and the coffee shop a la carte was also very good. The main pool is fabulous and the other okay - but the Jacuzzi is dreadful - small, old and uninviting. The bad - oh dear!! The rooms are drab, dysfunctional and this was after 3 changes!! We arrived tired after a long drive from Kandy and were given a twin despite requesting a double - when we complained we were moved to a double and told this was an upgrade - despite it being exactly as the other but on a different floor! Complain again - as this was supposed to be a 5 star - and the room was very tired - and we were told that we could move the following day to a luxury suite but not until 5pm. Trying to be accommodating and not spoil a so far wonderful trip to Sri Lanka we agreed not to unpack and move rooms the following evening. But, three rooms later - okay this was larger - a very large separate, very stark work room - with a private balcony and wonderful views but the air conditioning didn't work in the bedroom, there were cigarette buts on the balcony and the shower (which my husband couldn't stand under - built for little people) leaked to wet the entire bathroom floor. However, the wonderful staff, sous chef, and just about everyone we met were so lovely we forgave everything. But this is NOT a luxury hotel!! Just a very standard hotel charging luxury prices and it will be interesting when the 501 roomed giant opens its doors next door to see if it survives. Oh and the ugly - the sunbeds are from the last century and the pool attendants who set them up very pushy for their tips.",neutral

The rooms were clean and had a good bathroom. One of the best hotels in Sri lanka which provides great safety. but didn't have a nice view. If you are a sea food lover, you must visit this hotel. Crab, prawn, cuttlefish and many more seafood things in one place. Never experienced such a thing before. They had a good buffet with a lot of varieties and they served tasty foods. But only a few items were delicious. I experienced that drawback from this kind of bigger buffets serving hotels. Live music nights and a lot of services available through the hotel.

There were people in the pool wearing ordinary clothes. Which is so off-putting and unhygienic. You are supposed to wear swimming attire and wash yourself before getting into the pool. This made us feel very uncomfortable and surprisingly the hotel management didn't seem to take notice of it either. Then when we went to the second pool, there was another couple the lady was dipping with her clothes on! This is not the type of environment we expect from a classy hotel. I really hope that the management takes required steps and fix the issue. Other than that it was a great stay and an extremely hospitable hotel.",neutral

"I returned to Heritance Ahungalla after several years to relive my memories from the last trip which was excellent. This time however the hotel fell way short in meeting my expectations. It all started with a 45 minute waiting time just to get checked in. The lobby was storming with guests and baggage scattered everywhere reminded me of a government hospital than a star class hotel. The room was very clean and neat however, I had booked myself in to a ""Deluxe King"" room with a ""King Size"" bed on the ground floor (printed on the confirmation). However I had been given a room on the 1st floor with two single beds put together. We were so eager to get to the beach that the minute we came to the room we unpacked and stormed off to the beach. It was when we returned we figured out that it was not a king size bed. Called and complained to the concierge and I was told that ""Sir, you have to make a special request for a king size bed at the time of booking if you needed one"". After 15 minutes of arguing and speaking to the duty manager was I offered to be shifted to another room. Again, a very clean and comfortable room but a small shower in a very odd triangular shape. Not for someone who is claustrophobic. We went for dinner in the main restaurant and it was chock-a-block. They had stuffed every available chair and table in to it and we could only move about sideways. The seemed to have a shortage of plates as we had to wait up to 5 minutes sometimes for fresh clean plates. And no service what so ever. There were only five or six waiting staff to serve and we hardly caught a glimpse of them. We were never even offered water. And I am still waiting for the tea I ordered to the table on the second morning of my visit. Dinner was really good. There was a very decent variety of food and the taste was very good. But breakfast was not so exciting. There was no variance and every day it was pretty much the same assortment. In-room dinning was an absolute disaster. It felt as if ""In-room dinning"" is a whole new concept that the hotel staff is yet to hear about. There was no menu available in the room and two cheaply printed A4 sheets stapled together arrived at the door 30 minutes when we called and asked for one. We ordered two fried rice and let me tell you that I have had better fried rice served on a plane. It was a mixture of rice and boiled chicken with the odd piece of carrot. The hotel is beautiful, comfortable and very clean. As long as you lower your exceptions in terms of service, you might have a decent stay. For me however, I do not see myself returning any time soon.",negative

"We visited the hotel in April with my husband and small son.As we entered to the hotel we were warmly welcome by the infinity pool with very own heritance traditions and three different types of fresh juices also.Fortunately we could have a room within 10 minutes, even we didn't reserve our rooms earlier.It was fast when considering to the other hotels in Sri Lanka.We were guided by Ms.Supuni to the room and she explained us everything in the hotel with giving the maximum definition to the hospitality. Later my husband wanted to see the green pool even we were not allowed to use it because we were just for the day use. Again we were guided by Ms.Supuni and she explained the history of the hotel that we wanted to know. My son was very happy during the stay because he used to get lollipops when he needed. Food was awesome and I think there is no other place to compete with.Credits to chefs!Our room was cleaned and comfortable although we got a room nearby the spa. We have visited many hotels in Sri Lanka but never felt a hospitality as in Heritance-Ahungalla. Staff is very friendly and always supportive to the best of it. My son was very upset to leave the hotel and we couldn't extend our stay due to overbooked situation. Miss.Supuni is a credit to your hotel and definitely we will be back to feel the hospitality again to this beautiful hotel.Highly recommended for everyone!",positive

"Recently returned from a two week visit to Sri Lanka, staying mostly at the Heritance Ahungalla. The welcome was warm and friendly, with bags taken to the room quickly and efficiently. The room itself was clean, well decorated, cool and well equipped. We had a family suite, which had a bed big enough for an entire family!! Even though we had an additional single bed in the room, myself and my children shared the comfortable large bed and were very happy for the two weeks. The pools and poolside were cleaned daily. Sunbeds were easily acquired. We were in a group of 17 and found beds together every day we stayed around the pool. The quieter pool was slower for drinks, but ever so relaxing. The beach was breathtakingly beautiful. We weren't hassled at all. The current and waves were very strong during our stay, which meant swimming wasn't advised, however, we jumped and played in the waves which was lots of fun. All of the communal areas were kept clean and tidy. The lunch time menu at the bar was lovely. The chips and burgers were extremely yummy! Having booked on an all inclusive package, we used the one restaurant that was included for breakfast, occasional lunch and dinner every day. By the end of the first week, admittedly, this was a little monotonous. The food didn't vary very much from night to night, even though the chef did try to make it themed. However, the food was delicious and to a very high standard. It would have been nice to have a little more variety on offer though - perhaps in the way of a second restaurant/place to eat. Service for drinks in the restaurant was sporadic. Depending on the waiter, we could wait for around 15-20 minutes for drinks alone. We combatted this by building a rapport with one waiter, who after a few days, looked after us and would bring drinks quickly. The evening entertainment wasn't fantastic. And we found the evening's could drag a little. So be sure to take your own entertainment with you! While staying here, we attended a friends wedding. The wedding planner was very friendly, but failed to explain the traditions that the couple were undergoing in their service, which left them and the group confused. The hair and make up provided by the hotel were sufficient - although our bride did end up taking off the make up, as it was a little too much. The photographer was unobtrusive, yet quite dated in his approach. Even though these may sound quite negative, we couldn't fault the wedding itself, which was incredibly special to the couple and us as guests. The staff were so kind and helpful throughout. Overall, we were so pleased with our stay at the Heritance. All of the staff were happy and helpful. Everything was completed to a high standard. And yes, there were some aspects that could have made it even better, but overall, it's been a holiday of a lifetime. Would highly recommend a visit here!",positive

"Very disappointed with our stay. Rooms definitely need upgrades. Stayed in a triple room where the third bed was just a small folding bed. Blinds in the bathroom were broken and could see through them from the room and the outside. Flies in the room. Communicated all this to front desk but nothing done about it. The second pool was ""apparently"" under maintenance every time us locals wanted to use it but all the foreigners were constantly swimming!!!!! Again spoke to front desk and we were told the pool was not closed???? Very sad is all I have to say. If this is what we call 5 star then I have no words. Will not be staying here again.",negative
"Lovely looking hotel with a beautiful location. A few irritations though - no soap in the rooms, just two empty soap boxes in the bathroom bin! The boutique appeared to have exactly what I was looking for, but despite three trips to the shop and finding the ""open"" sign in the window, the door was locked and nobody was there. As we had to depart, I didn't have time to try to find someone. On arrival we had to remind the reception staff to give us back our passports. And there was extraordinarily loud drumming below our room for perhaps 45 minutes after dinner! We presumed there must have been some sort of cultural show on that we hadn't been told about. We were just starting to get really tired of it when it stopped. We had dinner in our room, and it was served quite promptly and was delicious. Breakfast was also delicious, with a great variety. Despite this list of irritations, the hotel was quite lovely, and if we had been staying longer, we would have taken the trouble to sort them out.",neutral

"We recently stayed at the Heritance and I can say that it was an absolute delight. From the moment you arrive it takes your breath away -- the drive up to the front of the hotel brings you to the view through the lobby, out over the pool and to the see beyond. The hotel's refurbishment has been sumptuous -- beautiful furniture, stylish decor and very well appointed rooms. The food was excellent. Every day we'd see the restaurant manager who would talk to us by the pool and tell us what the specials were going to be that evening, and on the one occasion we went to the fine dining restaurant we had the most exquisite food. We were brought two extra complimentary courses and had wonderfully attentive service (although I have to say that a very minor downside here was that I don't think the staff realised that the CD they had put on was a Christmas CD, which wasn't too appropriate in late January, but never mind...) It was rather heartbreaking that there were so few tourists around in such a beautiful hotel.",positive

"The hotel is a bit old and I would not rate it as 5 star hotel. I stayed there for 3 nights last FEB in a 2 interconnected rooms, the view was nice but the rooms were poor and give you the feeling of the 80s starting from the metal key to the furniture, the AC, the toilets…etc. I had all the meals in-room dining and it was by all means disaster, not clean at all (hair in the food, dirty plats, wrong orders) I made a complaint and the reaction of the restaurant manager was excellent and honestly he was professional gentleman…thank you Mr.KK.",negative
Excellent service. Friendly staff. Quality room service. We'll never forget the experience in Green pool. So much things to enjoy. Especially the spa! We enjoyed very much. Spend peacefull two days with mouthwatering foods and breathtaking views. Thanks Heritance!,positive
"After 6 busy and interesting days in Sri Lanka, we couldn't find more beautiful hotel than Heritance Ahungalla. The room have been cleaned twice a day. At the reception desk works very capable staff whome are always available. If you ever stay in this hotel please ask for mr Dinusha Kularathne. He made for us surprise in the room (flowers for wife and fruit basket). He makes a great effort to accomplish any request we had. In general this is the best hotel we ever stayed in, don't skip it if you ever come in Sri Lanka.",positive

"We stayed for Christmas 2007 and agree with other reviewers that the hotel has been beautifully refurbished. We had a fantastic room with a sea view, very comfy bed, huge bathroom, all spotlessly clean. The pool area is stunning and the pool attendants very helpful in brining loungers, towels and refreshing slices of watermelon. A few rupees on day one will get you a great spot and a parasol for the rest of your stay! However we were disappointed with both the food and the service. Yes the fine dinning is superb but overall the food was too ""international"" with very limited choice for those of us that travel in Asia for the delicious local food. As there is absolutely nothing outside of the hotel ,and only very limited choices if you take long a taxi ride to other towns along the coast, we soon became bored with the choice of one Sri lanka curry, one chinese style stir fry and the local dish of Devilled chicken. Personally we don't travel for 11 hours to eat a rack of lamb no matter how good it is! The hotel was busy at it was Chistmas and it took ages to get served, particularly at the pool bar. Over one hour for a sandwich and a beer for lunch on one occaision. Overal the hotel is excellent provided you like an ""all inclusive"" type of holiday. Having travelled extensivley in India, Thailand, and Malaysia we were a little disappointed in Sri Lanka overall. It takes forever to get anywhere as the roads are so bad and so congested, the food wasn't that great anywhere, Columbo is polluted and rather grim. Whilst the beaches in the South are fantastic we enjoyed our stay further North more. Tragically there is still a long way to go to recover from the Tsunami. The lack of tourists is having the effect that those that do go are seen as ""cash cows"" we felt somewhat ripped off on more than one occaision. Beware the moonstone mines - you can buy them cheaper in the UK!",neutral

"We have just spent over a week at the much vaunted Geoffrey Bawa designed Heritance Hotel. We enjoyed our week on the coast but find it tough to rate the hotel better than average. No doubt in its day the hotel would have been considered ahead of its time however today its minimalist design and decor highlight the fact that hotel is getting tired. The rooms have apparently been renovated recently and they are OK however the public areas are uninspiring. We visited a number of hotels on the coast while in the area. It was noticeable how many are either new - Chaaya at Hikkaduwa or recently upgraded - and Surf and Avani at Bentota, or in the process of being renovated - Vivanta by Taj at Bentota. The latter, based on the upgrade we saw to date, is going to be fantastic. The Heritance will need to watch its competition. The beach is nice once you've been rude to the touts to keep them off. Tourist information is not readily available and most things you'll want to do are away from Ahungalla. We got most information and help in getting around from the on site taxi drivers who can arrange pretty much anything including motor bike hire which despite the local traffic we would recommend. Tuk Tuk drivers outside the hotel are bad news - rude and argumentative which we didn't find anywhere else. Finally the hotel entertainment is amateurish. At +US350 a night it wasn't cheap for what it is.",negative

Place is very beautiful with a beach and a huge pool yet the worst customer service ever. I ordered a baby food in advance but that was prepared in the last minute and was served really hot. There is no emergency lines to call in the nights. We asked for in room dining but staff were hesitant and was saying to join the buffet. We were waiting for our breakfast to be brought to our room for more than an hour.When we called the room service they said buffet is still not open due to less staff but the time was 7.10am. Highly disappointed.,negative

"It was a pleasant experience from the time we got off the vehicle to the time we got back in to leave. The welcome we received and the casual check-in process they adopt put you at ease immediately.

It was obvious that the staff were well trained as the service received from different staff members from different departments were the same and exceptional. The quality of food and the variety available at all meals made dinning a pleasure. They even handled our request for exceptional family rooming requirement and accommodated us. We will certainly be back soon!",positive

"Me and my family planned this small vacation to Heritance ahungalla because of a recommendation from a friend and after seeing the amazing photos that they have in their website. We stayed in two rooms and the rooms were pretty much normal. The view of the sea was covered from trees as it was in the 1st floor. And basic amenities were there. Nothing to get excited for. Food and the buffet was terrible. Only few options were there for vegetarians. They have not given their attention to minor things. For an example I had to request a different salt shakers during ALL the THREE meals I had during my stay. (One table didn’t have any salt/ pepper shakes, other two times - the salt was stuck in the shaker) . Also the arrangement of the buffet was hideous. Food were all over the place. The variety of food was really poor compared to the price we paid. The pool was amazing though!!! The view and the feeling was spot on ! And top notch!",negative

This is the worst hotel I’ve ever stayed. Not compared to other 5 star hotels even just some random hotel with no star ratings is better than this. Our check-in was at 2.00 and we arrived at about 1.50 and the person there asked if we are starting from dinner and she said lunch will be closing at 2.30. once we went to get the lunch all the tables were full. they told us to wait outside till a table is available. we booked 2 sea view rooms and only view we got was pool. rooms were not cleaned properly. you cannot even walk barefoot on those floors. bathrooms were dirty and not properly maintained. we went to the pool at about 7.00pm and the person there told us the pool will be closing in 10 minutes. but when we asked before they told they close the pool at 8.00pm. the guy at the pool don’t know how to speak to people. after 10 minutes he came back and told us to leave. there was a lasagna at dinner buffet that smelled really bad. There’re so many other things and this hotel shouldn’t be a 5 star hotel. mainly the staff is very rude and they treat guests like they are staying for free.,negative
"i was at the hotel afew days ago with colleagues for a workshop. The location is well located. Staff were also pleasant and of help while needed. My main disapointment was the rooms. As i was taking a shower, water didnt run through the drain as fast as its supposed to. This was a clear indication that the drainage is poor. Also, i noticed a dry roll of tissue placed on top of the septic tank, Yak! I immediately threw the tissue in the bin.The walls of the bathroom are not very clean. I would suggest that they invest in putting tiles on the wall. The sheets were also not sparkling clean. One had a stain of something......i dont know what. The towels are also not new. I had one tired look towel which they tried to hide with the newer towel. The hotel needs to really look into the small things that give guests total satisfaction. Otherwise, i dont think i would want to go back there in the near future.",negative

We'll be back! 👍",positive

Veg sushi had the display but was mixed with seafood & chicken, and sadly even the chef couldn't figure it out until he tasted it & then confirmed.",positive
"I used to be very pleased with service and product. Today after 4 month I come again but the place has changed. Now be careful if your bill. A waiter asked me you know how many beer you have consumed, my answer yes; 3. Waiter no 4.well it is only 3 and this is fraud attempted by the staff. They had to admit that yes only 3 beer was served so why have this stupid discussion trying to make me pay for something not consumed. Very disappointed.",negative
"Big buffet but flies on table and crawling crabs under tablecloths in airconditioned dining room. The tiles in the shower area had never been cleaned. Dull resort as very little to do beside swim in their pool. The beach is unsafe, no water sports. Only one table tennis table and one carrom board. Very warm and friendly staff but housekeeping and reception leave much to be desired.

"We were a group of 20 people in 10 rooms at Heritance Ahungulla for the new year. The service is absolutely the worst I have encountered across Asia. Staff in general are unhelpful and sometimes rude. The breakfast place is fine but the bar and snack place is absolutely terrible. We had to wait for almost an hour for a club sandwich and when asked three times they kept saying “2 minutes”. Finally when I approached a more senior person at the bar, he was totally unapologetic and asked the same waiter who said “yeah, I will get it”. This is one example amongst many incidents - from no towels in the pool to poorly made up rooms. I certainly do not recommend it - there are many other places in Sri Lanka that are far better.",negative
"We stayed here as part of a tour of Sri Lanka, finishing with a 5 night stay by the beach. Positives: the staff are friendly and try very hard. Food was plentiful and usually of good quality. The pools are very pleasant and well set out. The size of the room was good, and the aircon worked well without being too noisy. Drinks were reaonably priced - large beer £1.20, cocktail typically £3.75. Negatives: the building is over thirty years old and doesn't really look as though it has had a proper makeover at any time. It looks a bit tired. Although the staff try hard, they are bit chaotic and prone to mistakes when it is busy. On arrival, the wrong bags were sent to our room, and despite me making this clear, the porter seemed determined to leave them with me - a minor gripe, but typifies things. Drinks and food orders were wrong on occasions. I think that the food was pricey for Sri Lanka at £20 each for food from the buffet. Food at the buffet was not always piping hot, depending on what time we went. There is almost nothing to do outside the hotel. The ""entertainment"" in the evening is dire.",neutral

"We visited to celebrate our anniversary. Even though its quite apparent that we are a couple, a twin room was provided. In the reservation page its mentioned about a sea view room (""best perhaps are the private balconies – from where it will seem as if the sunsets are ablaze in glory, just for you""). The photo also showing a sea view room. But we were given a garden view room in an isolated corner. When inquired the answer was ""sorry sir we are full today"". Its not an excuse. I must mention that we were not late for our check in . Actually we came around 12.30pm because we planned to have the lunch as well . Then moving to the condition of the room itself, It's very old looking small one. The doors were rusted, stained & discolored. The Bathroom is small, ancient & basic. Walls faded & definitely need painting & renovation. Even most of the 2-3 star level hotels provided a much superior rooms than this. Neither Toothpaste, toothbrush nor shaving items provided which are expected to be provided in a 5 star hotel. We had to asked for it. When asked they have provided us with two packs of toothbrushes & only one of them had a tiny toothpaste for us two. Anyway we manged it economically for two days although both of us used to brush teeth after each & every meal. We didn't bring those because all the other five star hotels we have visited have provided them without any fuss & we honestly expected this hotel to be the same standard level. I noticed the lack of the shaving kit only in the next day morning. I knew i had to ask for it again. But as we are checking out anyway i didn't bother the housekeeping staff early in the morning and left my self unsaved for the breakfast. I'm wondering whether they are providing older rooms especailly for the discounted booking offers. We reserved Heritance Ahungalla thinking that they would provide with the same exceptional service like their Heritance Kandalama which we visited sometime back. Anyway we have determined to avoid Heritance hotels here after as its not worthy taking any risk ,after our anniversary got totally ruined. I truly hope you could make some improvements in the future.",negative

"Amazing hotel, very friendly and helpful staff. Our two night stay with a 3 year old was very relaxing as we had plenty to do, two pools and a wonderful beach kept us all busy and happy. My daughter loved the traditional dancers and the evening event and still talks about it. Food is great, you have a lot of choice at the jute buffet, the in room dining is great too as you can sit in you balcony and enjoy a meal in comfort. The hotel was fully booked on our weekend stay, but still got a hot dinner served in room withing 20 minutes which I thought was good!. The hotel is set slightly away from a town, so for longer stays and wondering about you may have to walk about half km to get the the gates to access the main road, and would struggle to get about on own if you are not a local. You can get a tuk tuk, without much difficulty during the day. I would like to thank the staff and management for the wonderful time we had and would love to stay again on our next holiday! I found it is a nice touch that senior members from Management team Mr Razeen, Mr Sampath and celebrity Chef Mr Kumarasinghe spent time meeting and speaking to guests in the evening without sitting in offices. I felt it was nice that they cared about how guests felt and they were easy to access if you had concerns. Thank you!",positive
"When we arrived we were taken to a room that clearly wasnt set up for us and our two kids. Not only was no baby beds set up, we could not commit to the room as it was too dangerous for our kids. The balcony had steps to railing, which meant our 1 year old could jump or climb over. There were holes i the railing where our 1 year old could slip through. We then spent almost 2 hours looking for another suitable room. Its been horrible as the only room they could put us in has no floor space to walk as the infants beds and pram take up the entire room. Im so sad that i bought my family here on a holiday as its horrible. They are moving us rooms but this is costing a lot more. This place is not for families.",negative

"Excellent location and beach. Hotel is a fantastic design. Great food and the majority of the staff are really friendly. Unfortunately however, although the management have repeated on a number of occasions that the renovations have been completed, they are far from complete. We did have a look at some of the rooms that had been renovated and they looked excellent. Unfortunately, we weren't in one of these, our room was extremely dated, the cleaning was not done to a very high standard and we don't think the balcony had ever been cleaned! We used the pool furthest from reception which was excellent, with well-kept lawns. The major problem here is that there are only 8 umbrellas, unless you want to sit under the trees, we we didn't. I always sit under an umbrella and my wife always sits in the the sun but the problem is that the pool boy reserves the beds/umbrella's for those that have tipped him previously which then involved us having to have an argument with him most mornings to get a place with an umbrella - on some days there were 2 or 3 umbrella's/sun chairs that he had reserved but there weren't used all day as the guests must have gone out for the day, but he wouldn't let anyone sit on them! The main pool at reception area is excellent although the surrounding lawn areas are extremely scruffy. Overall had an enjoyable holiday and stay at this hotel but the room we stayed in wasn't up to standard. Stayed first 2 weeks in Feb 2017.",neutral

Firstly the rooms are looking tired and old!! -The bathrooms were filthy!! i asked house keeping to re clean!! Shower screens had mould and l was told this is hard to keep clean! - what a load of rubbish!! - Beds had bed bugs in them, we were bitten so badly and i thought this was odd as we have been traveling around SL for 2 weeks and not one mozzie bite throughout the whole trip! -Cockroaches in the bathroom after dark! - Complex too large (may be a positive for some people) - Main dining room dark and mouldy smelly + The positives are the staff!! Always friendly and very eager to help.

"Our stay was from 01st of April to the 02nd of April. As April was a month where a lot of tourists are attracted to Sri Lanka, the hotel did have a lot of guests. But the staff made sure that everyone was treated in a special way. The mastermind behind the architecture of Heritance Ahungalla is Late Geoffrey Bawa and as a result, it’s one of the most striking resorts in the Sri Lankan coast. From the moment where you set foot in the hotel till you leave, the staff stays by your side making sure that your stay is memorable. We experienced a situation which made our visit unforgettable, on the 02nd of April. It was my daughter’s birthday on the 02nd and on the previous day, Mr. Nipun Mawatta happened to know about it from a friendly talk with us. However that simple conversation was enough for him to alert the rest of the staff to surprise my daughter at breakfast on the 02nd by appearing suddenly with a trolley laden with balloons and a birthday cake with the restaurant crew coming together to sing happy birthday as she cut the cake. It was totally an unexpected, well-planned surprise and Mr. Mawatte and the staff deserves a shower of thanks. Not to forget, the food at Heritance was always “never-enough” due to their taste and variety. The rooms were lavish and we highly recommend the rooms with the ocean view as it is truly amazing. The infinity pool is always inviting in the burning heat. During our stay, several gents in the staff decided to display their hidden talents from a hilarious performance after dinner. It kept everyone laughing every time we recalled it. Heritance Ahungalla is one of the greatest places to experience the beauty of the Sri Lankan coast and a place “WHERE TRADITION IS ALIVE”.",positive
We have just returned from our first trip to Sri Lanka. We had a wonderful time and Sri Lanka is stunning. We stayed at the Heritance Ahungalla expecting a little bit more than we got however the biggiest disappointment was how dirty and aged the rooms were. There was no bath and the shower was filthy as was the rest of the room. My son on the first night was sick (not sure how) however we asked that the room be fully cleaned the next day which is was not. You could still see the smears of sick on the floor from where we had cleaned during the night. The bed sheets were also stained and did make you wonder if the sheets were clean stains or not. The corridors to the rooms were also in a poor condition and looked more like the corridors on a run down housing estate (I can say that as I lived on one for 5 years). The bathroom amenities are also just refills with dirty lids so make sure you bring your own! However!! The staff were amazing and so attentive and the natural beauty of Sri Lanka makes it all worth while. Would we go back to the same hotel? No! Would we go back to Sri Lanka? Yes! Yes Yes! Special mention to Sri Lankian immigration too who are so friendly. Looking forward to returning to Sri Lanka.,negative
"I used to be a frequent guest since early 2009. This hotel used to be one of the best in every possible way. I should say that the location is great, with absolutely stunning views of the southern beaches of Sri Lanka. The architecture, flora and fauna gives a very relaxing feeling away from the commercial/business feeling. The staff is still very helpful, most would bed over back to entertain the guests. During the last visit with my wife they even upgraded me to their best suite, the Sachin Tendulkar Suite with no buzz or hazel at all. I must say, the rooms are of good size. But unfortunately that is where it ends! The buffets are not up to the standards ( I am being very polite and generous towards the hotel here). Variety is lacking, taste is lacking, freshness is lacking. The edible items run over in 1 hour, so if you go there it late - you are left to trial the buns and sandwiches like parchment, and some left over stuff. As with many other hotels in SL they seem to cater a specific corporate client base, as a result the food spoils it for the relaxing holiday traveller. This is not just one time experience, but my observations over time. Restaurants and ala carte has little to offer. The ""best suite"" feels like collapsing on one end, not cleaned for days on another note, and worse of all even the renovation seems to be left at half way. Little activities happening at night, and the management does not seem to be interested in addressing it for years. Last few visits all I felt is that the staff at junior positions, room services, and reception are trying to blow some warmth and energy into it, but the higher levels seem to be not bothered about what they offer to the clients. While I do believe, looking at the number of corporate customers in the restaurant (mainly East Asian and Indian - whom I have randomly come to contact with, have informed me that they are sent to this place via corporate arrangements, not by choice) that the hotel is likely making good returns and is not financially pressured to invest in restructuring and renovation; it makes me sad that this is like an aincient giant which is approaching its last legs. Would I recommend it to anyone? Probably not if you are on your vacation. Given there are quite nice new boutique hotels in the area, for a fraction higher price point. Would I go there again? Probably not, unless the hotel addresses these issues effectively, because it's a waste of time and money the way it is.",negative
Unfriendly staff Fake smiles Attitude Lack of flexibility I feel like a burden on the hotel I didn’t feel like a guest at all Discriminative I felt that im not welcomed One of the staff interrupted me while i was talking to his colleague and told me 1 minute then he started to talk in Sinhala while me standing waiting for his permission to talk lol My first and last stay in this hotel,negative

"We felt we could not relax whilst in the grounds, the local sellers both men and women, hid in the bushes of the hotel on the beach, waiting to get people's attention. As soon as you stepped onto the beach, you were surrounded by them. Also so much rubbish strewn about the perimeter. Overall the hotel lacked any atmosphere, maybe it is too large for that? The staff were all lovely and friendly. For the money we both felt very let down, it is marked as a 5 star hotel but I would disagree with that.",negative

"We visit there as out department annual trip. From the start the experience was terrible. General check-in time was 2.00 p.m. Be we waited for ever to get our rooms. We were at tjhe lobby and we had to check every 10 minitues for the room availabity. After great difficultly I manage to get my room around 4.00 p.m. Room condition was not that satisfactory either. to get the hot water after turning the tap it took considerable time. First time I thought there was nop hot water. Bidet shower was made awful loud noise. In the restaurant if the table is not prepared it took some time to prepare it. I still missed certain items like napkins, I asked for severral times and eventually continue witho out it. Food was average in both lunch and dinner, but the brakfast was better. Inside the rooms the cellular service was poor, sometime absolutely no reception. I can't find any reason for this but all my friend experience this issue.",negative
"We are a European Asian couple who came to Sri Lanka for our Winter vacations. We admire Geoffrey Bawa as a legendary architect and decided to come to one of the hotels designed by him to live his work for real. So We booked two nights in Heritance Ahungalla. Today is the second night of our stay and we just left the beautiful beach after the music reached the point of a super loud sound test. When we checked in we were made to sit and wait in front of a really loud bad music group. We complained a few times about the loud music right in our ear but they smiled and continued, forcing us to move away with our bags. Otherwise the treatment we got in checkin process was cool. But all the good mood was gone thanks to the awful music. Bawa designed his buildings in a way that the outside is coming to the inside and there are lots of open spaces. So really bad music in full volume means that you will hear it all over the hotel even in your own corridor. We complained more than 10 times and witnessed that other tourists were laughing at the music and walked away as far from the lobby as they could. The hotel management put really ugly ridiculous christmas decoration in the lobby and inside the beautiful infinity pool making, a big mockery of Bawa who designed the lobby so that you see the sea behind the infinity pool. The food was okay, nothing special other than a terrible vegetable chop suey and vegetable fried rice we got for yesterdays lunch. They have great freshly baked bread and spreads which we loved. And nice veggie burgers. Our room was interesting, as it seems to be originally as designed by Bawa years ago. The mini bar was dirty inside and the refrigerator quite rusty. The wifi worked well for my computer every where in the hotel, but my wife had not as much as luck as i did. The staff were trying to give us a friendly face and some times we met nice people. A front desk guy called Khan was really funny and cool to talk to when he helped us secure the late checkout which we were promised via booking.com. The dining area got really wet under my own feet with lots of rain water this morning when it was heavily raining. Our corridor and the bar/ reception area was flooded because the roofs and windows were leaking. They have amazing pools designed by Bawa and we used every opportunity jump in to them. The hotel is an architectural masterpiece and in a very cool location. However, the company that runs it seems to be treating this paradise for architectural lovers as just a another cheaply run 5 star hotel to use as space for mega groups they bus in to maximise profit. The loud music and badly maintained building may kill it for most. For us, we will not come again unless some miracle happens tomorrow. We are extremely disappointed of the fate of Bawa's hotel.",negative

"So it seems that even though we booked a 5⭐ hotel, we were unlucky to get the most outdated dirty rooms I've ever seen in such highly rated hotel. I always judge my room by the condition of the bathroom. The bathrooms here in both rooms were so dirty. The shower was the worst. The shower screen was completely covered by soap scum. The tiles were mouldy. Clearly the housekeeping had not heard of bleach or sugar soap or any kind of deep cleaning. Even run down hotels can be presented well with proper maintenance & care. These rooms don't deserve anymore than 3⭐ rating. Very disappointed. The food outlets however were fantastic. We dined at 3 outlets during our stay and each area was superb. Food was delicious. Best buffet food I've experienced this time in SL. The service was equally incredible. We travel with a toddler and we can demanding however the team made it so pleasant for us. Thanks you F&B team. Keep up the great work. You guys run a true 5⭐ rated Hotel restaurant. Message to the Heritance brand. High time you pay attention to the condition of your rooms rather than leveraging off the great locations your hotels are based at.",negative
Ask for a higher level room with the balcony facing the ocean for a wonderful view.

"We are staying at the Heritance Ahungalla during the monsoon low season, but weather has been great. The hotel is a beautiful Geoffrey Bawa resort, not new but reasonably well maintained. We have a lovely comfortable, well appointed room, spotlessly clean and attended to each day. Beautiful swimming pool (can't swim in the ocean at this time of year as it's too rough). Friendly staff. Great breakfast. So why aren't I giving this resort 5 stars? A few problems. Firstly the service at the outdoor bar area is very slow for simple snacks/ lunch. You wait and wait for a simple sandwich for example. Prices are very high. With tax and service we just paid 2,000 rupee for a bottle of Lion beer, a lime and soda and bowl of devilled cashews. The resort feels a bit isolated and there aren't obvious alternatives for dining etc. (that may explain the high prices.) The resort is large. Next time I will stay in all boutique hotels and guest houses for more personalised service and better value in Sri Lanka. I feel a bit ripped off at this resort (and we have stayed at a range of places around Sri Lanka). Even up market resorts need to understand that there is a limit to what tourists will pay for basics.",positive

"Now, we have been coming back to this Hotel since it was called Triton because it stood out among typical beach hotels in Sri Lanka and coming here once in a while was treat for our children. It is a quite different now, and not particularly in a good manner. Our last stay at the hotel was on a weekday and was out of season. The property was about half full and a renovation was going on in the main side. At the dining hall, for some odd reason, there were no cloth table napkins and instead, a cheap replacement of paper serviettes. The food served were all so bland and nothing impressive, that's including desserts. I even overheard a couple saying that it was the same for the past few days! Breakfast had in store for us, an averagely spicy Sri Lankan food corner which was quite good. Pools and activity around the pool was enjoyable and the best part of this stay. An interesting underwater Zumba class also took place! The rooms were the same as before, thank goodness, but one thing made me stop my praise. The bidet shower was out of order. There was a surprise at the check out. I made reservation by calling this hotel and made sure that child meal charge was included with the price. (Child stays free in a double room sharing bed but for the meal, they charge about 30USD). In any case, we were asked to pay extra for the child meal because the price mentioned was the Double room rate. It was a mistake done by booking operator and the Hotel said that if we refuse to pay, the balance will have to be deducted from operator's wage. Since we did not want that to happen, we just paid and left. Overall, I think the hotel could have done a little more to repeating guests. I think that the hotel might have gotten complacent, due to the five star rankings people have given them, but as of now we lost loyalty to this hotel and unlikely to recommend others to stay.",negative

"We travelled as a family and stayed in a deluxe suite, so had plenty of room. The furnishings in the room were a little dated, and the hotel as a whole could do with a revamp. There is a new luxury 5 star hotel being built next door, and I wondered whether the Heritance is gradually sliding to the rung below international luxury hotel, so as not to have direct competition. The food and service here were definitely substandard in comparison to the other hotels on our trip (Ulagalla, Anantaya and Jetwing Lighthouse and Yala), and our son ended up with food poisoning on our last evening, nearly delaying our return home. It was hard to get a table in the restaurant, and once seated it was hard to get the staff's attention for any drinks. The hotel was not very responsive to requests (we had problems with ants in the room, a lamp not working and a couple of other things) but the boy looking after our room was very attentive. Having said that, the hotel was very helpful about allowing us to use another room on the day of departure so that we could continue to use the facilities. I think there was a laundry issue: each time we asked for pool towels we were told there weren't any, but they did eventually materialise from a tumble dryer. Service at the pool bar was extremely erratic and inconsistent - we usually had to walk up to the bar to get attention. The stretch of beach by the hotel was lovely, and the currents not as strong as in some places, but still a risk for swimming. There was often entertainment on the beach, but two days after fireworks, the debris was still littering the beach. You have a great stretch of sand, don't ruin it! All in all, the hotel gives the impression of a gradual decline, which is a shame. Our room (at the very end of a corridor) was very quiet, but our friends stayed in a suite nearer to the main part of the hotel (329, I think) where you could hear all the entertainment all evening.",negative

I liked everything very much. There was great room service. The maid Rukmsn did his job efficiently and responsibly and every day after cleaning he left a beautiful figure made of towels.

"I am surprised at the number of glowing reviews this hotel has received. Either my wife and I were unlucky, too hard to impress, or other reviewers for this hotel were being too kind. Ill start with the positives. The hotel grounds are very nice, the pool is excellent, the location right on the beach very nice. The rooms are ok, they have everything you might expect or want. Nothing more or less. However this hotel seems to follow the usual business model you find in these types of regions. Hire the cheapest staff you can find, provide only the basic training, charge the guests international rates, make a fortune on high margins. Staff were slow and spoke very little english. They cannot engage in conversation which is frustrating when you need to ask about the local area, request extra food items, or anything you might require. There was no imagination, such beautiful grounds yet no outdoor BBQ for guests during the day or night, outdoor pool bar, or even music. And then there is the idea of apparent supplementation of hotel income by allowing corporate/local guests in with their families in tow on weekends. About 20 screaming kids in the pool and all the deck chairs taken forcing guests like myself to retreat somewhere else. I just dont expect this at a hotel that wants be considered in the luxurious category. Food was overpriced for the quality. It was fine, just not what you would expect for the price. Staff would take away an empty bottle and just fail to ask if you wanted another. Basic stuff. Staff are just in a constant state of apathy. I found myself having to look for the barman, find the guy to bring my wife and I the towels for the pool area. They were just never where you wanted them to be. When you did they were slow and emotionless. And the hawkers waiting outside the hotel limits on the beach. I mean that put me off straight away. We couldnt go anywhere without being accosted by these people. If I want a poorly made garment Ill go the street market myself thanks. Other guests actually hesitated walking on to the beautiful beach just so they didnt have to interact with these people. How is that fair? Upon checkout, my wife and I sat in the lobby area for 35 minutes as we waited for our driver and werent offered a single beverage/refreshment. Guess once you check out you arent worth the time anymore? Given so many of us only have only a few weeks a year allotted for holidays due to work commitments, its heartbreaking not getting what you think you are paying for. I think the Heritance Ahungalla has become complacent due to all the kind reveiws. When compared to the surrounding area it is 5 star quality, but internationally its 3 star at best. Its not a bad hotel at all, just not that great. Therefore I gave it an ""average"" rating as its simply average. UPDATE: We have just checked in to the Fortress in Galle and it makes the Heritance look even worse. I wish we hadnt bothered with Ahungalla at all now. Im sure Ill get some half-hearted response from the management regarding my critique as they have done to others. I would have given it to them personally had they asked, but they never did.",negative

"I went here just before Christmas, with friends. It's a lovely hotel - good rooms, nice food, good location (although sea swimming a bit rough). Gym, swimming pool, jacuzzi, free wi-fi, all the trappings. But the service just didn't match up - it was very pleasant. all the staff were extemely nice. But poor English, sloppy service, long waits when ordering anything. So although I'd recommend it, I do hope that Heritance take some time and trouble to train the staff properly - it's a great hotel, but the service lets it down. Biggest black mark was the very vocal hawkers on the beach - they stay just on the hotel boundary, and shout and harass the guests trying to sell things. Not pleasant at all, and really ruins what would otherwise be a restful and relaxing place. I'm surprised the hotel hasn't negotiated with them to tone down their somewhat agressive selling techniques.",neutral

"I stayed here for 3 nights with my husband, my one year old and my four year old in August. This is a lovely hotel, well maintained with great staff. Everyone was very helpful and considerate especially as I spent most of my time running after my one year old. The only let down for us was that there wasnt a kids pool - my son could only stand up on the steps of the pool which meant we were constantly on guard. The close proximity of the beach was beautiful so the kids enjoyed the playing in the sand. The buffet was good - there was a different choice every night. For lunch we ate at the pool bar which i enjoyed more. There is a very small kids club room so the kids spent a little time colouring. I would recommend this hotel for older families or couple - purely based on the pool depth.",positive

"A tranquil & amazing stay at this hotel which is set back from the main road with a STUNNING INFINITY POOL and access to the white sandy Indian Ocean beach (where you can see fishermen working hard for their daily catch). Ahungalla is quiet and there are limited offerings around (although never too far away are roti's and spice gardens). The hotel has all of the amenities that you would expect from a top range hotel, so if you are looking for total RELAXATION, The Heritance delivers in spades! EXCELLENT service and incredibly friendly staff who work together to ensure guests enjoy their stay. On arrival you receive a mouth cleanser (different albeit slightly strange) and a welcome drink (multiple options - very refreshing). There were plenty of options for breakfast and dinner (vegetarians and even just fussy eaters have choices to make). The rooms are large, comfortable and well equiped - the best few nights sleep we had in a 3 week trip!",positive
"We stayed for 10 in the luxury room during February. The room itself was large and clean, however the accommodation in general needs to up its game to 5 star standards. We were shown two of the newly refitted rooms which were beautiful, however planned works due to start in May have been delayed. What a shame! Other areas of the hotel are showing signs of wear and tear for example the gym with its old equipment. Now to the positives of which there were many. The layout of the hotel is stunning with two massive pools at either end of the hotel. The staff at the hotel are outstanding with particular reference to the pool boys and resaurant staff. Nothing was ever a problem and each request was greeted with a smile . I would advise to eat at the hotel as there aren't that many options outside. Although buffet fare there was always lots of variety, and we were pleased We had a couple of issues , however these were sorted out by the general manager. If you are not happy speak with him and the issue will be resolved.

"• I am a frequent guest at Heritance and for the second time in 2022. My holiday joy and that of many other guests was spoiled by the majority of holidaymakers from two other countries. Her reckless and disrespectful manner caused anger among the other guests and hotel staff. Parents didn't take care of their children. The children took over the restaurant as a playground. Eating behavior unacceptable, ……. .Pool was polluted with sand. The employees tried everything to change this situation, but only met with rejection. Not exactly motivating. It's over now!!!!!!!!!!!!

Heritance Hotel Review,positive
"We arrived here nearly a week ago to torrential rain. This is the end of the monsoon season in this part of the island. First impressions of the hotel were lovely. The staff are what makes this hotel a pleasure to stay in. We were shown to our room which was a little dated but clean and cool. The rain Showers in the room are great and the shower gel smells of a tropical fruit sensation. Food here is amazing. The head chef Manjua runs a great team of chefs who are more than happy to cook you what you like if what's on offer isn't to your taste. They sure know how to make curries here. You must try every single one as they are divine. Our ever expanding waistlines are proof of this. There is plenty more on offer if curries are not your thing. A myriad of fresh fruit is available and bananas taste amazing, nothing like what we eat at home. The weather was good most days. Towards the early evening rain clouds gather and a heavy downpour follows. Perfect time for a G&T at the pool bar. Sunsets are incredible and worth waiting around to see. The beach is vast and deserted. Just a few hotel guests walking along taking in it beauty. There are however beach guys who nag the pants off you to sell you sightseeing trips. Be aware they usually don't have insurance so best to book with a reputable company. They are harmless just a few no thank you and they get the message. There are a group of ladies who sell sarongs and trinkets on the beach they are lovely and friendly, don't forget to barter here, start low and then usually meet in the middle. Be careful of the sun you burn very quickly and don't forget mozzie repellant and bite cream. We used a guide for our trips LASI TOURS LASI was great and drove safely through the traffic which is another world in itself. He is very knowledgable and will arrange bespoke tours according to your needs. Sri Lanka is beautiful. Made even more special by its people.

"Consistent with the other recent reviews we were scheduled to stay at the Heritance for the final three days of our SL tour. However, we checked out after the first night. On a positive note, the room was clean and recently refurbished. The food in the optional al à carte restaurant was also good and the restaurant staff very friendly and efficient. On the other hand, the hotel is extremely large with many guests on “all you can eat” inclusive deals. This created a very different feel to other hotels we stayed in. The staff were a mixed bag. Some were polite and others simply ignored you. The grounds were somewhat scruffy and the water in both pools was opaque suggesting a problem with algae (see photos). The adjacent beach was full of litter and hawkers. Having decided to check out were asked for feedback and this was positively received. Unfortunately, this didn’t result in any gesture of good will and we paid the full bill for drinks etc. In summary, the hotel is adequate if you want to eat, drink and sunbath cheaply but it does not provide the experience consistent with other hotels in this class.",neutral
"The reception people are very depressing. They are not courteous, rude and I was shocked that this hotel belongs to a group of hotels and a large company. The Reception people really gave my family a soar welcome and ruined our mood. They are very suspicious and look at you like we are thieves. Maybe the Management have to start customer service classes and put the right people there.At least people who can smile. Also responsiveness of services is also slow overall.",negative
"Booked over the phone for 3 nights which was ok enough. Nice enough hotel with a decent location though the beach was not as nice as you'd get in the east coast or even some Other parts of west coast of Sri Lanka. Most of our time was spent in the 2 pools as were the others from what it seemed as the sea was too rough during our stay. Food was ok, mainly buffet type of food with a decent variety though the fruit selection seems to be the same everyday (melon, papaya, pineapple & guava) Rooms and the hotel was a little dated to be honest and not worthy of 5 or even 4 star, especially compared to some of the other hotels we've stayed during this trip to SL. I do admit though that I have high expectations usually and wouldn't mind paying for it but this hotel was rather less expensive compared to the others and kind of explains why you get dated room & decor (get what you pay for right??) One things I should mention however was the price of food and drinks. It is an absolute rip off when looking at the cost of drinks. All the menu prices are expensive enough , but they add a mandatory service charge of 10% and government VAT 12.5% on top of the final bill which make you pay about 800 LKR (about £4) for a bottle of Corona. Note that local beverages are not cheaper either. A small bottle of water is about 225 LKR which is little too expensive compared to other Sri Lankan luxury hotels. The location itself is not close to Galle so not much to do outside of the hotel. We did do a boat trip on Madu river (about 10 miles out) which was as well worth it but I'd suggest you don't book through the hotel and go directly to the Balapitiya bride where you can see many tour operators and get a boat for a ride. Takes about 90 mins and cost us 2000 LKR (£10) which was well worth it. There also is a turtle hatchery that you can visit which is nice. I probably wouldn't come back to this hotel to be honest as I wasn't overly impressed but could be a decent location for the average, budget conscious traveller looking for a bargain, as long as the price remain cheap.",neutral
WORST HOTEL IN SRI LANKA,negative
"The hotel at 5* doesn't pull at all. It needs a good repair. Rooms are good, cleaning is good. But there are nuances like a broken kettle, the doors to the balcony don't close. Strange scenery on the walls. The linens are not exactly white. There are two pools. Beautiful ocean view. People are kind, sympathetic. The food isn't very varied. A lot of it's spicy, the beef's really tough. Delicious pineapple and papaya. There was no fish variety. Amateur salads. Ice cream liked it. They gave oysters once. The shrimp is delicious. The restaurant's not big. Wifi is weak. There are no TV channels in Russian. For all the faults, you can rest here well. In food find your own, the population is very positive and simple, nature is beautiful. Just whoever is coming here will tune in to another level of service 😊 Special thanks to the hotel, for your help and special attention to us!!! Not the hotel's indifference to tourists and quick response to the issue, for that thank you so much! Thank you very much to the staff! We wish the hotel prosperity and development!",negative
"The hotel was built in the early 1980s in the Sri Lankan style. Helpful and nice service, trouble-free contact in English. Rooms clean and spacious. A good base for trips to the most important attractions of the region. The swimming pool is clean and well-kept. No problems with sunbeds in January/February. There is a wide beach next to the hotel with a flat entrance to the ocean. I would highly recommend!",positive

I love this place for its beauty and architecture and have been coming here for years (the first time 30 years ago as it was my Sri Lankan father’s favourite) .

Set over 3 floors, long corridors.Gym, and spa (expensive). 3 restaurants, very good veg curry, best we had all holiday.Balcony to all rooms. Rooms could do with a little more lighting, very dark if you want to read or do work. The Large restaurant that is used for breakfast, is all enclosed, some times gets very noisy and stuffy.

Disrespectful and unfriendly front office manager and staff. From the time I arrived to the lobby. Wasnt provided a welcome drink and towel while other non solo travelers were attended too. Had to carry my own bags to the room. The front office manager was the worst employee I've ever dealt with and was extremely rude. Tried to over charge me for meals and came up with some nonsense explanation which has nothing to do with the guest blaiming the head office. when i made a noise regarding it so other guests could hear he asked me what i want just to shut me up. Extremely unprofessional and sadly this hotel has lost its way especially with staff. Same menu everyday for breakfast which was boring.,negative
"Pros - great view of the ocean (sea view avaiable with Premium rooms0 - speacious clean rooms - good size pools (note there are two pools, and one is mostly only offered to foreigners) - good spread for buffet (but its almost the same everyday for bfast) Cons - teriible reception/front desk service; had a don't care attitude and were often rude - had electrical problems in the room when the fan was turned on but even after informing the reception twice (on two seperate days), they did nothing about it..did not even apologise or offer to change the room - requested king/queen bed but were only given twin mattresses - no bath tubs, this is only available in luxury rooms - Not much choice for in-room dining - Don't visit during the weekends; the hotel allows far too many groups to have the spend the day on the weekends (allowing one or two groups is fine but there should be a limit so that the pools are not over crowded); My personal opinion is that the hotel treated foreigners differently to the locals (including locals from overseas); with the locals, they just didn't care. Me and my husband are Sri Lankans and we visit Sri Lanka often and like to escape out of colombo for a few days. We were really disappointed with the way they treated us. I think i've had far better service in other hotels in the area (bentota etc). Great hotel but would not recommend due to the horrible service.",negative
One of the best experience i had out of all the hotels i have visited.... the rooms are quite big and the view is so great.... the food is so delicious and has a very large variety and the people are very kind attentive and very helpful..... the servicr is superb i would say... overall a good hotel will come back again,positive

"We had a great stay at Heritance Ahungalla this January! The hotel provides excellent quality for its price, everything is clean and comfortable. The staff was very nice everywhere, from the reception to the restaurant, and always responsive to our needs (special thanks to our housekeeper Rukmal, who made our stay even more comfortable:)). There is great food for every taste at the restaurant, if you’re curious about traditional food — it’s going to be heaven for you! There are always multiple types of curries, kottus and biriyanis, that vary every day. If you want something more familiar in food you will be satisfied too! We really miss having fresh sweet fruits with every meal. There are two pools at the hotel, one is very big and popular among kids, and the other one is smaller but way quieter and just heavenly. The nature at the hotel territory is very pleasant for the eye. There are some cute little animal visitors on the territory, but no scary big reptiles or insects (you need to be cautious of mosquitoes tho). There is live music in the lobby every night and one of the evenings we were surprised with a beautiful cultural show. On our first day we met a great tour guide whose name is Nimal, we bought an excursion from him to go to the old town of Galle and were very satisfied! We’ve had a great day, Nimal brought us to various great places and recommended a nice restaurant, we’ve taken our time and explored all these places and the old town itself. We definitely recommend Nimal’s tours! He is a great man that you can trust and always ask for a ride. I hope your stay goes as pleasant as ours! Thank you Heritance Ahungalla!",positive

There was a problem with my booking which meant I was delayed checking in. They sorted it in the end so all was well.,neutral
"My wife and I stayed here for three weeks and overall found it to be a comfortable and very friendly hotel. This is branded as a five star hotel, but in our experience, these star ratings are pretty meaningless and we have found that nearly everywhere we have been in the world. If you are influenced by star ratings you may be disappointed for reasons I will explain later. The public areas are expansive and the hotel looks out over a lovely beach area. The red warning flag flew every day of our stay and you would do well to take notice of this because there are strong undercurrents. But we swam nearly every day in the hotel pools both of which are large and set in the attractive hotel grounds. Our room was on the 3rd floor and a good size with all the usual fittings including tv with mostly English channels, very effective shower, balcony overlooking hotel gardens, hair dryer and a safe. One day a room attendant arrived to change the safe and after emptying, picked it up and put it on his trolley. Not so safe then! There is a well equipped gymn on the 2nd floor and there is good Wi-Fi throughout the hotel and even in the grounds it isn’t too bad. Here I have to mention what many visitors will regard as the main criticism of the hotel. The rooms are a bit dated and well used. By that I mean they do look a bit tired and in need of refurbishment. Having said that, I don't think people should be put off by this because there are many really good aspects to this property. For example, we stayed on an all inclusive basis and the food in the main restaurant is outstanding. Every day there are at least seven or eight choices of main course. If that's not enough Chef Manjula who walks the restaurant floor during service, will cook something to your liking. Most of the cuisine is curry orientated but you can get plain fish or meat. He cooked a very tasty sirloin for me. Coupled with the friendly service, and the delightful staff, this really is the main selling point of the hotel. It is worth noting if you are all inclusive that you can only get wine (it's Italian) in the main restaurant and not from the bars. This was a bit irritating for us since we are wine drinkers and didn't want to drink beer, shorts or cocktails they serve in the bar areas. The other point to be aware of is that for religious reasons, if it is a full moon the law forbids the sale of any alcoholic drink for the whole day. There are quite severe penalties if any establishment is found selling or distributing alcohol. We also got caught out on Independence day and regional election day both of which were no alcohol days. The hotel has two fine dining restaurants and a seafood shack called the Wadiyah. We tried this and had fresh grilled fish right by the beach. In our opinion, it is not particularly fine dining. The table mats were dirty, only bar stools were provided until we asked for proper chairs, the music stopped and was never restarted, the salad was very small and the area is poorly lit. It lacked any real atmosphere. You have to pay for any of the alternative dining and we paid 15000 Sri Lankan rupees which is about £75 including wine. We also dined in the Upper Room where mostly European food is served and had New Zealand lamb which was very good. In our opinion this is a good hotel with excellent food in the main restaurant and wonderful friendly staff. They really do go the extra mile to make your stay a happy one. This all goes a long way towards overcoming the increasingly pressing need for refurbishment of the bedrooms.",neutral

"The hotel needs refurbishment. Some of the corridors and courtyards were in a very poor state. The meals were OK, although not up to 5 star standard. There was only one ala carte restaurant. The restaurant staff were a credit to the hotel - always willing to help. Unfortunately, cant say the same of the reception staff who would benefit from a communication skills training course. The Gym was very poorly equipped and certainly did not merit a 5 star status.",negative

"After a 6 hour drive we were welcomed to Heritance Ahungalla with a drink and fast check in and shown to our rooms. We were upgraded to a suite which was a nice surprise and invited to the managers cocktail party. The rooms were very spacious, quiet and clean with wonderful views over the ocean. The pools and grounds were immaculately kept with staff to help you move day beds, supply towels and tend to your every need. The food was great in the restaraunts, but very dissapointing room service and pool bar/ outdoor cafe food - the ""hot"" food always came out cold and the icecream was served melted and the staff were not that keen to fix it. We wre lucky enough to be invited in to the kitchen for special cooking lessons which were wonderful. I found this hotel to be a wonderful place to relax and unwind at the end of a busy holiday.",negative

"Staff is very friendly, but the hotel is very outdated. For the price you pay there are better or cheaper options available in the surrounding area. Facilities are ok. Rooms are very old. It looks like the hotel did very small to keep the place presentable. The only good thing is the pool. Big and great for kids. Restaurants are also not bad and food prices are fair. We had a good time but I personally believe that the hotel management can do more to keep the place more vibrant. Also checkin experience is somewhat strange where guests can feel little unwelcome with the process in place. We got electrocuted when using the hair dryer. Unit was definitely faulty. We reported this to the hotel but no management came to investigate or consult our family. We manage to get a replacement and luckily it wasn't a big accident. I'm not sure if the hotel deemed safety of guest as their utmost priority. But in our case, it felt as though they just simply ignored. I don't think we will visit there again. Locationwise, it's a good place.",neutral
"Just return from a week in Herritance Ahungala. The hotel is amazing with its infinity pool facing towards the ocean. Plenty of sunbeds, beautiful beach. Maybe the rooms needs to be renovated but that is no important, the most important are the people, with their heart on hands just to make your stay perfect. They are not a staff they are a heritance family and try to do everything that you become also a part of their family. Food prepared by Chef Manjula is just delishes. Beginning from European cuisine ending on real taste of Sri Lanka. Grilled lobster, crab curry, dhal, egg hooper are to die for. The food was the best I have been eaten in the all-inclusive hotel. Must say that in many good restaurant you will not eat better. Chef Manjula, who I have had chance to meet personally gave me is even his secret recipe for dhal. I have seen some negative comments about the rooms, food, cleaning- so if you look for a just the hotel (good drinks, animation, standard hotel food) do not go there but if you want to feel the soul of Sri Lanka is the place for you.",negative

"Years ago this was probably a very grand hotel, however the grandeur has faded. The location & facilities appear very good, however the devil is in the detail and the lack of cleanliness makes the whole place feel grubby. I have stayed at numerous 5 star hotels around the world and have seen how standards vary in each continent. So using a European standard I would only rate this 3 star, which might meet some guests expectations. The staff are very friendly and energetic as we have experienced in all seven hotels during our two week Secrete Escapes tour. What this hotel lacks is Management direction to fix the cleanliness issues. As an example I enclose pictures of our recently renovated room where staff regularly create “towel animals” when they should be directed to scrub mould of the newly tiled bathroom walls & floors.",neutral

"We stayed at the hotel for 2 nights during the 2nd week of August. Took the new Southern Express Tollway to get there and was amazed at how the relaxing the dirve was compared to the Galle Road which we have driven through in the past which used to be a trying experience. The GRO greeted us and offered us a choice for the welcome drink (Watermelon, Orange and coconut water) and also a refreshing cold wet towel which was most welcome as the humidity was pretty high that day. The hotel pool which can be seen from the time you get off the car is absolutley fantastic and overlooks the ocean. We were upgraded to higher level room which gave us a pool view as well as a partial sea view. The lighting in the room was decorative and as I've always noticed in most hotel globally too dim during the night. Why the designers of hotels allover think that mood lighting has to be dim I will never fathom. The food (we were on HB basis) in the retaurant was fabulous and they had a western as well as Sri Lankan choice. We had lunch on 2 days from the speciality restaurant on a la carte and that too was excellent. The choice of wines is limited as expected in a 3-4 star hotel of that standard. The beach was quite nice although the sea was quite choppy on both days due the season we were told. The hotel has limited activities compared to a 5 star hotel in the city but this is to be expected as one goes to these type of resort hotels only to enjoy the beach and pool. The hotel does have a 2nd pool but we did not use it as it was 1.7m depth all round and was too deep for my 2 kids and also had a lot of leaves fallen in du to the close proximity of large trees along the pool. The service was quite good but could also be attributed to the fact that we were staying during the week where the occupancy is lower than compared to the weekends.",positive

"My partner and I have arrived from the UK this afternoon and we knew instantly, that we had made a big mistake choosing this property as our base in Sri Lanka. The lobby has as much ambience as my mothers funeral in September!!!!!! It is dark, unwelcoming, cold,uncomfortable furnishings and lacks any kind of warmth and inviting environment. We had paid for an upgrade on our room prior to leaving the UK with a double bed deluxe sea view. We got neither. Room was damp with a smell of urine from the bathroom. Interior was again dark with numerous scratches on furniture. No ocean view and two twin beds put together and the safe was not secure to anything!!!!! Tiles missing from the bathroom and no kettle,ironing board and iron!! The list is endless. Complained to the management and the front of house manager did state some of the rooms had not been upgraded in thirty five years. We were moved to another room which was supposed to be an upgrade. Alas not. Toilet that leaks, as well as the air conditioning: no secure safety box and the smell of fresh paint. Have eaten n the restaurant this evening. Best described as bland, average and uninspiring. We have already been in touch with our tour operator to move us or we will be returning early home. The only positive are the very friendly staff.

There isn't an on complex shop so you have to buy everything in the bar and trying to get out of the hotel main gate to the road is a nightmare as the locals swarm around the en trance ready to pounce on you, they find it very difficult to take ""no"" for an answer. The same goes for the beach, you cannot get on it in without being harassed as they line the edge of the hotel grounds. Would not recommend booking holidays thru the rep as these are double the price of using the hotel taxi's to take you to the same places. If you are not giving the locals, be it where ever you are, tips for this that and everything then they are very abrupt and can't get rid of you quick enough, especially the rep!

"The hotel is very tired. Everything in my room worked, but everything was a little shabby and shabby - both the furniture and the plumbing. And even the ponds with lotuses and carp behind the hotel - if they were at least cleaned, it would be a completely different feeling. The food is beyond praise. There wasn’t much to eat around anyway, but in the hotel - if you take national cuisine - huge portions and very tasty. The staff tries to solve your problems, but not quickly. The cleaning is lousy, whether you leave a tip or not, it doesn’t affect the amount of sand on the floor. The hotel always had free sun loungers, which the staff will put where you need them upon request. There are a lot of different animals on the territory - monitor lizards, palm squirrels, funny birds. And also a skinny cat and two very cute dogs (the latter, however, were chased by the staff). Monkeys walk on the roofs, but they are also chased, it is not so easy to see them. The beach is public, but given the location it is mostly deserted. At the exit from the hotel to the beach there are annoying merchants, and you feel like you are alone on the coast. The entrance to the water is perfect fine sand. There were always waves, occasionally strong, so not everyone could swim. There are nuances, but overall it’s a good hotel, although of course it barely reaches 4.",neutral

"We visited three Heritance Hotels during our stay. This was sadly the only one where customers were secondary to hotel maintenance. We were Woking up by hammering of temporary barriers and scaffolding at 2 am as well as loud porters moving beds all through the night. That said, the day staff were all pleasant and helpful but little thought was given to guests when they carry out maintenance work both day and night. The hotel rooms were tired and needed the work, but managed well, they could have sealed sections of the hotel rather than maintain where guests were occupying rooms.",neutral
"It's gorgeous beach front hotel and nice swimming pools. I spent a total of 15 days after returning to Sri Lanka from Australia. Room was very spacious & clean, and filled with amenities with a balcony overlooking one of the swimming pools. Everyone at the hotel staff were really friendly and attentive, right from the start of booking process to the end. Special thanks goes to all guys at the restaurant including Chef Chandana, Lilanga and the manager for adding a personal touch to the dinning experience. They were always willing to go the extra mile to satisfy my taste buds.",positive

"I want to share my experience (no so good) at The Heritance Hotel Anugila. I along with my 2 sisters had made a booking for the 3 of us for 2 nights 17th and 18th August 2017 at The Heritance hotel Anugula. We checked-in the hotel on 17th Evening and were smoothly escorted to our room number 224. 1- On reaching the room we noticed that the floor was a little wet and asked for it to be cleaned with a delay of 5-10 minutes the floor was cleaned. 2- Tired of all the travel throughout the day, we thought of making some tea/coffee in the room, just to find that there were only 2 of all the things in the room. 2 cups, 2 glasses, 2 spoons etc. (for a room booked for 3). Why would the arrangements be for 2 when the booking is for 3??? 3- The electric kettle was placed in a cupboard which had no plug points. we had to shift the kettle to some other table to actually use it. But again to my surprise, the electric kettle plug (Flat pin) and the plug point (Round ones) in the room did not match. 4- My sister sat on the third bed to find out that the bed was actually not stable. If you sit on one side of it, it would lift up from the other. 5- We called up the rooms service for the above 3 points (2,3 and 4), but to my disappointment they could not have been slower. When you have a 5 star facility I would expect the staff to know English. The room service were not able to understand our plain English!! The room service addressed the plug problem, we made tea, and one of us had tea in a glass tumbler as there were only 3 cups in the room! 6- I went for a swim in the evening and came back to my room to take a shower. I land up in the bathroom to find out that there is no Shampoo or conditioner in the room!!! I call up the reception for the same and they tell me they will send it to my room. I wait for almost 15 mins no hear no knock on my door. In the end I had to take a shower without a shampoo or conditioner. 7- At dinner that night, my sisters were a little disappointed as there were not much veg options (they both are vegetarians). The chef was there taking feedback and my sisters told him the same. The next morning we were to go for an early whale watching trip and had to leave at 5.30 AM. We had already asked the reception to pack our breakfast. Previous night, while talking to the chef, my sisters told him that we would be leaving early and to pack good breakfast for 3 (2 veg (for my sisters) and 1 non veg (for me)). We woke up and were leaving for the trip. The reception handed over our breakfast nicely packed. We opened the packets around 10AM on our way back from the trip to find out 3 non-beg meals!!!!! My sisters could not have breakfast that morning, thanks to the chef’s goof-up! 8- We reached our room, called up the reception for shampoo and conditioner (Which were still not there in the room). The room service comes to the room with an unlabelled bottle and said that was shampoo. I asked for a hair conditioner and I am still in shock that he did not know what that was!! I explained what that was, and he said that they do not have a hair conditioner available!!! Believe me I am in shock as I write it!! 9- The day went on, we did not want to spoil our mood as we were on a 3 sisters vacation! But the next morning when we woke up, we found out that the entire room was dripping of water (see pictures attached). The room had always been wet throughout our stay (as found on check-in) but it started dripping literally next morning. We had our luggage placed on the table above which the ceiling was dripping! All our clothes were wet! We had to quickly move the luggage from there to the beds. And then there was no place to sit. I called up the room service to show them that, to hear a reply that we should not have the window open. We were in a sea facing room and were there to enjoy the sea, not to seal ourselves up in an AC room. That we do anyway at our offices when we are not on vacation. Why would you be in a sea facing room and not have the balcony or windows open?? I have not seen a beach side 5 star property of not having slippers or bathrobes in the room. I do not think these facilities should be provided on request. Isn’t it obvious that on a beach side resort the guests will go to the beach (or swimming pool) and would need slippers? Why should they have to ask for it?? Again still in shock - No conditioner!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! There are no plug points next to the bed!!!!! only 1 plug point far away fromt he bed. No multi-plugs available in the room. You have to call room service for that as well! We were in Sri-Lanka for a 7 day trip, stayed in all 4 star resorts. We wanted our last 2 days to be special and relaxing and hence we chose a 5 star. Our experience in all 4 star places was far better than these 2 last days! A Dissatisfied customer",negative

We stayed at this hotel for two nights at the end of 3 weeks touring Sri Lanka. We really enjoyed the beach and lovely swimming pools. Our room was average directly above the main restaurant with a very hard bed we asked staff to it a mattress topper which they did but was not really any better the second night. We We're woken up very early one morning by room service but had not placed an order Breakfast wAs more like a cafeteria this hotel is very popular with the locals and they obviously have very different standards to us they love a Buffett which is exactly what we don't want. This is supposed to be a five star hotel and they certainly charge accordingly but they are not providing five star service or food More expensive for two coffees Than in Melbourne we did not eat any other meals at this hotel we went out to local restaurants recommend jungle Beach 10 min walk turn left at the beach Heritance need to have a look at there food and in particular the price of water prices $100 US for dining on the beach without drinks and the food is just not good enough standard The staff were friendly and pleasant at all times we found this at all Aitken Spence hotels,negative
"We spent 2 days in the hotel and it was a lovely experience. Buffets are very good. however, it could have been better. however, we had to wait for more than 2 hours to check in as the room was not ready. finally we checked in around 4pm. That is the only negative comment i'll have to mention. however, we don't mind visiting again in near future simply because of the food, pool and the long island iced tea/mojito served at the pool bar.",neutral

"The hotel really is tired, needs updating and a good clean in places , some staff rude and unhelpful. All inclusive package is not worth the money as they run out of the decent beer and water down cordial to put into spirits as you can’t have fresh juice. Food is very good. I find the hotel is not like the pictures. Sun beds are filthy and in need of a clean. Swimming pools are too hot and could do with some cold water as it is not refreshing when your sunbathing and need to cool down.electrical sockets came out of the wall and needed to be repaired, patio doors did not shut properly this also had to be rectified. Needed som information on transport from reception and we were told to Google it, Unbelievable. Shame there is not separate smoking areas as you choke on smoke wherever you go. I am well travelled and shocked that this hotel shows 4 stars. Other than this I would recommend to anyone who wants a 3 star hotel.",negative

"The sign next to reception says the hotel was voted the best 5 star hotel in Sri Lanka in 2010. If it's true then I just wonder what the rest must be like ! The original standard room was appalling and after complaining we were upgraded to a deluxe room which was good. All public areas are in need of refurbishment and there is a lack of any serious evening entertainment. Alcoholic drinks are some of the most expensive I have come across, either in Europe, Asia or the USA. The dinner experience in the Jute restaurant is mediocre, unless you like curry. It's a buffet and nothing is really hot. There appears to be a problem with the extractor fans and as the breakfast is cooked in the restaurant there is always a cloud of smoke circulating in the mornings.The room has a low ceiling and the decor is dark. The are two nice pools but the tiling around the edges is very uneven and loose. The beach is long and pleasant but the irritating, aggressive beach hawkers who stand ten metres away shouting to attract the attention of the guests make life unpleasant, they are a major problem. The beach has a lot of debris strewn about , bottles, polystyrene etc, but the management claim it is the job of the local council to clear it. As a previous poster has said, there is nothing close to the hotel and very little to do. For $150 per night it would be reasonable, but for the $300 per night ( b&b) we paid it is way overpriced. As Sri Lanka seems to have their own star rating system, I would rate this hotel on an international basis as no more than 3.5 stars. The staff go out of their way to be helpful",neutral

"I've spent two nights on B&B basis at Heritance Ahungalla. Actually my wife and myself had a good time at the hotel with its really nice surroundings. The bedroom was pleasant and relaxing. We really loved the pretty large beach area which is just great! also the pool was spacious. However the responsiveness of the staff and follow up was poor. E.g. My wife is pregnant and she needed bottled water as we have run out of the two, so i phoned house keeping .. hours passed by without any water at all. So i had to go my self to the bar and get two bottles. We even called the reception and they said they will look into it. Water to the room never arrived. Meal variety in ala carte menu was not good either. For people who signed up for B&B doesn't have a variety to choose from. Even at different locations such as Coffee shop and snack bar have the same menu. no choice what so ever and we couldn't make a decision as what to eat.",negative

"On arrival, when Reception was informed we'd been confirmed Room 333, we were told that our room would not be ready for another 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, we were then told that it would not be ready for another few hours as it's a luxury room & will take that long to clean. When we asked if this was because the previous occupants checked out late, we were told they didn't know, and when pressed, they admitted that was the reason. When we said that shouldn't have happened as the room was booked, & previous occupants should not be allowed to check out late, they offered us a ""transit room, free of charge"" until the room we had booked (which was more expensive than this ""transit room"" was ready. How could they possibly think we would be happy with a ""transit room"", which was cheaper & more basic than the one we had booked & put up with the inconvenience involved in changing rooms? When we said we weren't happy with this & insisted on talking to the Manager, he finally turned up some time later & said the previous occupants couldn't be vacated on time as they were elderly & disabled, but they would have four cleaners clean the room & it would be ready in 30 mins. Finally, we had access to the room we booked at 3.45pm (although, we should have had the room at 2pm), but we still had to wait another 15 minutes (i.e. until 4pm) for our luggage, which had been sent to the cheaper ""transit room""& had to be brought back. So, they broke their contract. A room we should have had at 2pm, was only given to us at 4pm (2 hours later). We later discovered that the previous occupants were not elderly at all. Therefore the Manager LIED. We complained to the head office and got nowhere. We have not stayed in this hotel again as a result of this disgusting treatment and we NEVER WILL. This happened some time ago, but I'm still so angry about it that I want to report it.",negative

"My fiancé and I returned to this hotel following a stay in 2011. We enjoyed our time spent here and combined a visit to Ella and a stay in a guest house in Kosgoda. We would agree with other reviews that the hotel is in need of updating, however we heard that they are closing the hotel next year for improvements. Having said that, the rooms are fine and all areas are very clean (just quite tired). The service and hospitality is very good and friendly, the bar staff, pool/sunbed staff and especially the lovely man we had cleaning the room (Asoka), we saw him every day and he always went over and above, asking if there was anything he can do or anyway he could improve our room. We actually asked to change rooms as we weren't happy with the view from our first balcony (it overlooked the pool and we wanted something a little more private) and within 30 minutes a new room that suited us was ready. The pool area and garden are beautifully maintained and we loved our time spent around the pool overlooking beautiful Ahungalla beach. We stayed on a B&B basis as we enjoy eating outside of the hotel and there are lovely places to do this; the two beach restaurants just a 5 minute walk from the hotel (jungle restaurant and sunshine restaurant), a beautiful restaurant in the next town along (sankarest garden restaurant, a 5 minute tuk tuk ride at 250 rps). There are also other restaurants in Bentota but this is slightly further afield, 20 minute tuk tuk journey at c. 700 rps (depending on how you haggle). We went to tutle hatchery whilst there and a boat trip, both very worthwhile doing. As previously said, the beach is beautiful and very quiet however, I would be interested to see how it changes once the 500 room (vs. heritance 140) hotel next door is completed in two years time. As other reviews have said, you do get a bit of hassle from the beach sellers however this didn't bother us to much and seemed to die down after a couple of days of saying 'no'. We did book a boat trip through a nice guy called Charli who we'd met and had trips with in 2011, you can find him on the beach and ask any of the sellers for him as they all know each other. We would have liked to have taken the opportunity to hire bikes from the hotel but the weather was just to hot during our stay for either of us to have wanted to do this! Overall we really enjoyed our stay at heritance.",neutral
I dropped in to this resort with my Wife for lunch while returning home from a meeting. Loved the welcome and the super hospitality by the front office crew and loved the juice cart that goes around serving the exotic juices .. i have been visiting this resort even before it re branded .. its indeed a beautiful resort . Not too happy on the Spread they had for the Buffet Lunch for the price paid .. but indeed the quality of the food that was there was 5 star.. it was a very basic spread .. May be it was due to the low occupancy.. i loved the hospitality and service quality received from the begging to the end .. keep up the good work and improve on the Buffer spread on weekdays ..,positive
"Although not near the town centre, this hotel is sited on a beautiful beach, with two pools it has something for everyone. Totally rebuilt after the Tsunami.

Large comfortable bedrooms, air con bit noisy though. Staff delightful and helpful.",positive
"Checked into hotel Mid August into a luxury room and I would highly reccomend paying that little bit extra as the rooms are huge! And you get a bath tub that overlooks the pool.. but no one can see in as there is mesh stopping.. so its very private! On arrival sat down with a welcome drink (Pineapple or Wood Apple juice) as we came early from Colombo around 11am and room was not ready.. but that did not bother me as they advised full occupancy in hotel before we came and cannot get early check in which was ok because My partner and I sat in the bar and had a few drinks.. they came to us and gave the key instead of us going to reception.... Went to our room! and I thought it was very very clean.. the bed was so comfy... In the luxury rooms there is no ceiling fan tho, but you have an aircon which gets cool in the nights ... Room was cleaned every morning and evening.. fresh towels and bathrobes... Both pools were good but i prefered the private pool the best! & it had a spa you can use from certain hours and relaxing!! I used the Coco Spa and got a sweedish massage and it was the most relaxing thing, and was very professional as they drape you properly with the towels and do an amazing job.. they are Balinese ladies and very lovely and do a great job! My husband got one the following day! Food in the resturant was beautiful... you can get your Sri Lankan curries or you can get Bbq night.. prawns.. lots of salad to choose from... & soups.. my favourite was the deserts.. so lovely ... Staff and chefs were nice! overall i would stay here again.. beach is too rough to swim though which is dissappointing.. as im from Australia .. i love the beaches..

"Ignored by the bell boys at arrival and left for half an hour in a dingy bar to await our room. Despite a choice of only 3 welcome drinks, the barman managed to get one of the two wrong !! Eventually given a room which was right on the beach, but seemed to be the only room in the hotel without net curtains, so no privacy at all. We then noticed that the door lock was hanging off so called maintenance. While waiting for them, we discovered a jammed cupboard (so no access to safe), a poky, smelly bathroom and a TV with no reception. Eventually went back to reception (after unconvincing lock fix) and demanded a new room which we were given after another hour's wait. It was better, although lighting was poor. Cleaning was haphazard, towels were often taken but not replaced and there were no insect sprays/mats. Each morning one of the pool boys comes and blasts the pool area with rap music to try to encourage aerobics participants - they should listen to the words one day, which are about 50% expletives and not everyone's taste !! Food was OK but nothing like the Kandalama, another Heritance hotel. Spa was very expensive although treatments were good - watch out for $ prices which mysteriously end up being a lot more in rupees (works out about 140 to the $, not 115). Lots of hassle from beach sellers as well. Overall we were very disappointed as we had such a wonderful time at the Heritance Kandalama in Dambulla and expected the same from this sister hotel. For half the price you can stay at the Kani Lanka in Kalutara which has better food and entertainment.",negative

"This is a strange one, to be sure. With a few tweeks it could be one of the best beach hotels you'll ever stay in anywhere, but in the comparison with other places we stayed in Sri Lanka (and particularly Mount Lavinia), it just seems to fall short in areas that it would be so easy to correct. The setting, design and physical feel of the hotel are all quite stunning. But right away you get those little irksome contrasts that make this a frustrating place. Complacency abounds and you sense that they are still all patting themselves on the back for being able to re-open after the devastation of the Tsunami (yes those dreadful Youtube videos from Boxing Day 2004 were from balconies at The Triton, which has now become The Heritance). Positive sentiment isn't quite enough at the 5 star level unfortunately. It sits behind a gorgeous stretch of beach with surf that you just are dying to play in just 50 feet away - but to get from hotel gardens to the sea, you have to pass an almost comically persistent group of beach tradespeople each time. The hotel has a line of flags to keep them at bay, but the security staff still let them bother you from a distance when you are on a sun lounger by the pool. Would you get accosted by a panhandler on the steps of the Waldorf Astoria as you left to get in your cab? The sidewalk is public space but things can be done..... The two pools are large and magnificent, with the green pool so huge it even allows you to ""length swim"". There is also a gym with fairly up to date equipment, but its functionality was comprised every day of my stay by an inability of staff to get the message (despite 3 reminders in 3 days) that the aircon needs to be on and set to below 28 degs C for anyone to be able to use it. The minimalist design of the public areas has an overall calming effect on you, but with the architect apparently having a veto on everything, this extends to a lack of many of the features that you expect in any large resort - an excursions / news board; signs to different areas; names on the bars etc. We had little to complain about the food. In fact it was fairly reasonably priced for a putative 5 star, but it had little real wow factor, and apart from some of the local dishes on the buffet menu, it just scraped by. Last year we stayed on Meeru Island resort in the Maldives and despite the obvious abundance of produce in Sri Lanka compared to a coral attol, Meeru's buffets were both more inspiring and much cheaper. The room was spacious with a big balcony - as it should be for just over $300 a night! But the bathroom was blatantly unfinished with two walls smooth plastered but not painted. Some guests demanded a room change for this - we were told it was a design feature (see photo). With such a huge balcony a sun lounger rather than just 2 chairs and a table would have been an idea. And why oh why was there no rack to dry wet clothes. There was plenty of space, but maybe the architect had his say there as well. All the staff we interacted with were cheerful and accommodating, apart from the reception staff who were a bit feckless and needed to be a little more proactive. We were invited to a cocktail party given by the assistant manager, and found him charming and with an earnest concerned approach to some of the criticisms we gently raised. It really did not sit well however to be told that the beach sellers were tolerated on a ""better the devil you know"" basis and that other ""newer"" nationalities amongst the clientele liked having them around. I am not so sure the Heritance is that well advised to try to imitate Sharm El Sheikh at these prices. Lose the traditional customer base and I think they will lose much of their trade to the likes of Mount Lavinia. If you were to stay here and, as we are, you are fairly easy going if the weather is good, (as it was), you will probably be happy enough at the Heritance, give or take the $100 or so a night that should still be in your wallet. But I can imagine it could quite quickly become a nightmare in bad weather. You even had to pay to play on the pool table. Free pool if you spend 1500 rupees on drinks - come on! To end on a positive note of a review which I had intended to be somewhat more complimentary than it has turned out, the laissez-faire approach has allowed wildlife to remain on the grounds undisturbed. To see massive Iguanas digging for crabs next to your sun-lounger while chipmunks frolic around on your umbrella stand is a uniquely warming feeling. We were even able to film troupes of monkeys and even pass them mango pieces to eat on the branches of trees by the pool. Enchanting.",neutral

"Stayed here for 2 nights as part of a tour around southern Sri Lanka. The positives: Large pool Very helpful staff Well appointed room - large bathroom The negatives are more numerous and sadly affected the enjoyment of our stay. There were about 8 locals hanging around on the beach outside the hotel for the whole time on both days. They were very aggressive in the way they would wait for you to leave the safety of your hotel sun-lounger, and try and sell you everything under the sun. Just be firm and say nothing else other than 'NO!' If you engage them in conversation, they will pester you ALL DAY. We saw others suffer as a result of this and the hotel must do something about it. Worse still, there are sellers operating within the hotel itself, pestering you for palm readings and the purchase of overpriced wooden ornaments. The hotel management need to realise that the hotel should be a refuge from some of the hard-sell that exists out in the surrounding towns. Also the hotel did not seem particularly clean, and the food was distinctly average at both the Upper Room restaurant, and the 24-hour restaurant. There was some renovation work going on, but I didn't let it effect my overall view as all hotels need to do it at some point. Normally hate to be too critical, but there are some issues that need to be addressed before this one can call itself 5 Star.",neutral

"We have just returned from a 2 week stay at the heritance. We travelled as a family of 2 children 2 and 4 yrs plus granparents. We had an excellent time and would not hesitate to recommend this hotel. The architexture is stunning with a very calm atmosphere and a wonderful infinity pool that blends into the beach. The pictures don't do it justice. We stayed in their 2 interconnecting rooms 301 and 302 which were spacious and had excellent see views. They made them up as a king size and 2 singles which suited us great. You could hear the entertainment but it finished at a reasonable time. The ""animators"" were really helpful, building sandcastles and flying kites with the children. We all enjoyed the daily aqua aerobics. One of the best things about the hotel and sri lanka is the poeple. The were very friendly and genuine and made our stay one to remember. The service was very occasionally slightly chaotic in a nice sri lankan way, but everyone was very helpful. The food was the best that we tasted anywhere on our trip in the hotel. Breakfast is excellent and the food in the coffee shop was v tasty. The chinese and BBQ buffets were worth it and we weren't charged for the children. Drink prices were reasonable (we were charged twice as much in the hotel on our trip to Kandy). We did some trips around the area with Bertie from the sunshine resturant at the end of the beach. I would definitely recommend the river safari as not to be missed. This is an excellent choice for those looking for relaxation in a stunning setting. There is the option to explore locally and futher afield. We can't thank the hotel enough for an excellent stay, (they are happy to be contacted with room requests before you travel).

"My cousin and I had a wonderful stay at this resort . We feel that a special mention must be made about the staff at Heritance Ahungalla . Never have we seen staff at a resort or hotel who were so attentive to your every need . One truly outstanding person , is Kusum , who works at the restaurant The Jute ...... What an amazing person ! He was so attentive to everyone 's needs . You did not have to wait long for anything you needed . When we were eating the most delicious "" appoms"" with our fingers , Kusum was there with a finger bowl for our messy fingers 😄....even before we could ask for one . He remembers little details like the hot tea that we always end our meals with and brings it to us even without us asking , just at the right time ... Kusum always had a beautiful smile for everyone at the restaurant . Chef Roshan was another person who impressed us , he heard that we were eager to eat a certain type of fish and he took the trouble to check with his kitchen staff to see if he had the fish as he wanted to cook it specially for us . I have never seen any place like this , where the chefs all come out during meal times , smiling and greeting their guests . We will be back and one of the main reasons will be because of the fantastic staff that 's at Heritance Anhungalla.",positive
"HOTEL: We stayed at the Heritance for 10 Nights. The hotel and staff are lovely. After reading a previous review about being to scared to leave the room, i feel that this is an insult the the hard working staff there. At no point did we feel we threatened by staff, housekeeping staff smiled and never asked for a tip and the same said with the staff in the bar area. I suppose the hotel could do with a lick of paint but as for broken sunbeds i didnt see any, and there was always loads to choose from. The only negative thing about the room is the size of the fridge which is very small. But again it wasnt a real problem. YES.. you tip for most things but we never felt preasured to do so, and even if you do its 100rs at a time! The sellers on the beach are a bit of a pain, but a firm no and they go off to the next person, and after a while getting the same response from us they didnt even bother. Our room was on the 3rd floor and it was lovely, and we even had our own little gekcho which was great for eating insects. Our room was cleaned twice a day with clean towels and more water. The food was lovely, the only downside is there isnt much options for vegitarians. The only major downside with ther Heritance was location. when we travel we like to go out and try local resturants which is why we booked b&b, however other then the little fish resturant (which is cheap with lovely food) along the beach there isnt anything walking distance. We did take a taxi RS3500 (that waited 3hrs and brought us back to the hotel) to Hikkaduwa where you'll find bars/resturants and several rotty cafe. If we'd of known this we would of booked HB as we ended up spending most evenings eating in the hotel. TOURS: We did several trips whilst in Sri Lanka. The first to Uda Walawe park, as much as it was a long drive it was lovely to see the elephants roaming around freely, its def worth a visit. We then did a 2 day trip to Kandy and Sigiriya again a lot of driving, we stopped off at a tea shop on the way which was ok, then the botanical gardens which is a lovely place to sit with an ice cream and watch the world go by. We then went to the temple of tooth which was lovely, and to be honest go without a guide as ours was a bit of an idiot trying to get us to pay for him to study etc etc.. which we felt was very cheeky whilst inside a buddhist temple!!! In Kandy We stayed at Chaaya Citadel which was lovely and great food, to be honest it was a shame we only stayed the night. The next day we had an early start and more driving to Sigiriya, this was via a spice market and to be honest at 830am we probably wasnt the most awake customers!! but we listened and left! Once we arrived at Sigirya we headed up the many steps in the mid morning heat!!! the views at the top are lovely and make for great photos, they even had a family of monkeys that live on the top. Then it was the 7hr drive back to the hotel. Be warned your driver will take you to various tea/gem and spice shops!!!! We asked our driver if we could skip these but its something they have to do, even though we put our foot down and said no to the gem store. Overall we enjoyed our stay at the Heritance and its lovely staff.",negative
"On first appearances this hotel wow's you. This is not 5 star by any stretch of imagination. Over priced and quite tacky. Maybe the best in Ahungalla, not in Sri Lanka. There sister concern ""The Tea Factory Hotel"" beats them by a canter on all counts. The long corridors leading to the rooms were run down. The room was large with a sit out. The housekeeping was slack. The food was quite mediocre. The buffet is a total rip off. It is very highly priced and the food was very average. The beach boys on the beach are a menace and quite intimidating. It put you off from wanting to step out on the beach. Would I return? No.",negative

Also, we requested a tripe room and a double room was given by just adding a folding bed. They facilities for the room was only for two and we had to request for the third persons facilities on anf off despiting paying for a triple. the reason given by da hotel for not providing a tripe room was it was not ready of occupation.

"We checked into the hotel on Sunday a day before a public and bank holiday after the security checking we seated in the lobby for nearly 1/2 hrs and there were no welcome drink no wet towers Following day we saw the cart is serving the guests. Hotel was very crowded and we feel that not enough staff members attend for guests .Huge crowd for lunch dinner and breakfast and we had to come late for all 3 meals . Food was good but less varieties. No entertainment only 2 pics band was playing in the lobby and that also stopped at 11 p.m. due to restrictions , We feel that hotel should give more priority to its in house guests . Rooms are good and clean. The pool was very nice and refreshing. This hotel can be maintained better compared to what we witnessed.",positive
"Apologies ! This should have been written a while ago. By no means does the below completely under rate our experience, but hopefully the feedback will be taken as useful, with both the good and bad. The Bad: Having to change rooms the last 2 days, due to water heating and aircon issues. Lack of food options when less guests (totally understandable but still a shame, especially at breakfeast). Wear and tear is visible, a renovation would be a great bonus. But it by no means spoilt our trip, just an observation. Alot of mould in the bathrooms, requires some attention. I know it's a beach resort but the build up can get a little much. Due to choosing ""all inclusive"" option, the cocktails are very limited. Are nice but limited. I think if I went next time I would not do all inclusive, purely so we could enjoy a bit more diverse range. Snack foods however, (I recomend the fish and chips!) are lovely ! Due to post covid, lack of features and actitives are limited (again understandable, but needs mentioning prior to booking). Examples, Bicycle rentals, Spas, nightclub etc. Also the build up on rubbish on the shores, but again was due to time of the year with the seas as well. The Weird: The constant hello from a lady passing the perimeter of the hotel nearly every day trying to sell something. A Foreign guest who seems to be treated like royalty & known by all staff (Hi Aiya?!), I know there are less guests, but 3 beds, 6 cushions and 6 towels (with change every few hrs) for 2 people is a bit much... Also witnessed the attempt of trying to give chocolates to everyone including children (other guests) seemed a bit weird, maybe their form of a Santa? The repetiveness of the music in the restaurant and the bar, please I would advise working on changing this ! Or atleast having a different playlist alternating every other day ! If I heard John Lenon's Yesterday instrumental one more time... !! And the rest of Good ! (a lot more) : Firstly, the highest points go to the the staff and service, truely everyone that worked there were such amazing human beings, and we were humbled to have stayed at the resort with them ! Their commitment and attentivness was visible throughout our stay, so thank you very much to all of you. Cleaners : Nearly every day not only were the rooms tidied, but we were left with decorative and hilarious towel arrangements ! Kudos to the creativity ! Shout out to Dukmal and his colleagues for this ! I wish you all the best sir. Front of house & general assitance : Welcomed from the first minute by all and every request and detail asked was attented to. Samith whom we were greeted every day by and was checked in on was a great help & very friendly, even arranged a tour to the Safari for us and breakfasts to take was ensured. Sorry we missed saying good bye to you ! Hope to see you again. Restaurant: Lilanga, a gentlemen in charge of the restaurant, with a wealth of knowledge and tries to cater to all your needs . If you ever feel a meal is not right or if you need something, do reach out to him and he will help you, Thanks again ! A big gratitude to Jananjaya, whom we felt looked after us so much every day. Whom we grew to bond with, it was a pleasure meeting you ! Other names to mention, and sorry for not remembering all ! Tony, Panditha, Chamila as well, and also the lovely ladies who always greeted us and sat us down to our tables for every service. Bar: Much thanks to Calinga ! Thank you for all the cocktails. And again others who served us at the bar ! Pool: Both guys we had were amazing and made sure we always had towels, and cushion for the sunbeds. Dinesh, very nice to meet you and always laughing and joking made us so much more at ease. And last but not least, although I dont have names to mention. Many thanks to the security guards who would tend to go unnoticed, but honestly they made us feel safe and secure always seeing them around. The location, on the beach front, shame about the rough seas, cannot wait to see what it is like when the seas are calm ! With the infinity pool in the main area, it felt like you were in the sea anyway ! The food selection, although sometimes smaller, sometimes bigger. Always had a good variety for most days, and was always very tasty, and fresh. As one can expect, spices are prevalent but again requests can be made to amend this. There is alot of western options to accomodate. Again a shout out to Tony whom after talking about the fact that we never saw any Kottu on the buffet, was then on the main Buffet stand the next day being enjoyed not only by our selves but all other guests ! Buffer / BBQs on the outside garden is alway also a great addition when they can accomodate this ! The peacefulness. I think due to the post covid situation, we had the best of both worlds in a sense. Weekdays we pretty much had the pools to ourselves, and the weekends more locals arrived and so the resort was busier. As much as the peacefulness was appreciated, hopefully in the future, more ""animations /activies"" & I would look to see all bars in full operation, can be achieved to change the days up a bit. The wildlife, Birds, Iguanas, lizards, monkeys. Nothing disturbing but made it so much more tranquil with the plantation as well being among all of this. Not to mention the few dogs and cats. If you like plantation indoors as well, then you will enjoy the rooms and hotel itself as well, at night time they look even better if the lights are working. We stayed at Heritance 15th to the 27th. And really hope to visit another time in the near future !",neutral
Not very impressed,negative
"This ought to be a great hotel but it ends up only being a good one. It lets itself down on a couple of fronts. First the good - the food is excellent both in the main restaurant and the fine dining restaurant. In particular we were very impressed with the team that look after the pool bar and the fine dining room. Worthy of particular mention are the guys in Lakmal's team including Dilan, Kolitha and Silva who were chatty without being intrusive and went out of their way to help. Dinesh made sure that a birthday celebration in the fine dining restaurant was special and memorable. Also the pools are very large and the main pool is really beautiful. The hotel is justifiably proud of having been designed by Sri Lanka's most celebrated architect Geoffrey Bawa. The view as you arrive at reception is fantastic looking right through the hotel lobby and over the beach to the sea. Unfortunately our experience of the front desk staff is they manage to be both obsequious and a bit too full of how good they think the hotel is at the same time. We were particularly annoyed when they failed to pass on two important messages from our tour operator. The rooms also look the part at first but fall victim to style over substance. There are so many hotel 'ornaments' that you have to clear loads of stuff out of the way to put your own belongings away. The light over the desk is hung so low that you bang your head on it whilst it manages to keep the mirror above the desk in complete shade. You have to ring housekeeping to ask for many of the things we found provided automatically in other hotels such as adaptors and mosquito repellers. You also need to make use of the Do Not Disturb sign pretty much whenever you are in the room or you are likely to find your bed being turned down at 6 in the evening! We also experienced power failures on almost every evening - not the end of the world in themselves but it would have been nice to have had a torch in the room instead of sitting in complete darkness until the power came back on. The bathroom was one of the biggest disappointments as it only contain a shower. We asked twice about moving to a room with a bath and once were told there were no rooms with baths and the second time were asked for $100 per night to move to a room with a bath. On both occassions we were told we could use the jacuzzi near the resident's pool if we wanted a bath although we were never brave enough to stroll down there in the altogether with our soap and shampoo! The jacuzzi is actually a cheap plastic afterthought that would have Mr Bawa turning in his grave. In summary this hotel did not impress as much as other hotels we stayed in during our trip. It charged for things such as internet usage and had not done a great job of anticpating our needs in a way that other hotels did that did not cost anywhere near as much as this one and it would probably not be on our list of places to go back to or to recommend on that basis.",neutral

"We stayed at 2 other Heritance hotels which were fantastic, so we were bitterly disappointed by the Ahungalla. Service was consistently terrible, filthy mattresses on the sun loungers (they looked like something that belonged in a sri lankan prison), no soap in the toilets, dinning room so dark another guest actually bought a torch to see their food.",negative
"We stayed th Sep. 7th Night at Heritance Ahungalla and it was a superb stay. We checked in a bit late around 8 in the night but from thereon to today the service and the staff had been absolutely helpful. The Food and the Cleanliness is also at an excellent level combined with the astonishing architecture. We reserved a Luxury room but it was upgraded to a junior suite by the Hotel itself for the reason of having a bath tub in the wash room was one of the priority for our reservation of a luxury room, and not having one in luxury rooms they upgraded us. The view also pleasant and top pf it all the staff is really friendly and assertive in their very own way.",positive

The hotel decor is a little stark and requires a makeover - with the corridors resembling a hospital ward - a few pictures would liven the place up a bit. That said we ate at the Bar Restaurant and the food was very good. the hotel pools were enjoyable - but the seclusion was spoiled as the beach was intersected from the hotel grounds by a number of hawkers - who were polite enough but incessant. The beach was lovely - and we even witnessed a giant turtle arriving on shore in teh afternoon to lay its eggs - amazing. All said - I expected more - and beware teh burning sun!,neutral

"Our trip was in Dec which is a busy month. However when we called them in the morning to check if an early check in was possible they said 12pm would be fine. On our arrival we were made to sit in the lobby for 2 hours. We could have saved that time by coming later if it was not promised for 12 pm. When they finally gave us the room it was not cleaned well and we were told that the family before us had really messed it up and also stayed on way past check out time. Apart from this our stay was good. The room was big and spacious and the beds very comfortable. If the doors were left open a few mosquitoes would get in so its best to keep them shut when going to the pool or beach. The room service was ok. Best to stick to the rice as the burger we ordered was not very good. The fried rice was quite good. The staff are friendly and helpful. The chefs at the live stations in the morning (specially a lady) were very unenthusiastic about serving and overall the service was very poor. We expected more as it is after all a Heritance Hotel and should have 5 star service. The residents pool is the highlight. Its clean, big and quiet so we really enjoyed spending time at the pool. Hope the service improves.",neutral

"We stayed her for 11 nights at the end of September to celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary and this was our third stay here. We were married here (when it was Triton) in 2000. The staff are extremely friendly and really do want to make sure every aspect of your stay is perfect. I’ve read some of the reviews about the food which seem overly critical but there is something for everyone. There are chefs on duty during breakfast, lunch and dinner and if you can’t find something to suit your palate from the varied selection on offer – just ask they would be more than happy to make arrangements for you. We were very well looked after from the moment we arrived. We had made a specific room request which was met and we weren’t disappointed. We had a suite overlooking the Green (residents) pool which in our opinion is the quieter end of the hotel and this was important to us. The room was extremely comfortable, very clean and maintained twice a day (including turn down service) so fresh towels, water and anything you need is never too far away. I love the creations that the room staff make of towels and fresh flowers. During our stay we received a complimentary dinner in the fine dining restaurant. The chef on duty was TSM deSilva and it was an incredible culinary experience. All aspects of the meal were well flavoured and presented with such care. It was obvious to us that Chef de Silva has a passion for creating amazing flavours and he was keen to receive feedback on the dishes he creates and he chatted with us to make sure we were happy with all aspects of the fine dining experience. We enjoyed it so much we went back again during our stay and we weren’t disappointed. The second meal was as incredible as the first. They have a lot of talented staff here at Heritance and together they make a great team. We were lucky enough to be given a tour of the kitchens and the Chocolate factory which was absolutely mind boggling. The creations they create have to be seen to be believed. Keep up the good work and please don’t change too much of what makes this hotel a special place when you close for your next refurbishment (which we understand is due in 2016). The one thing I would say is if you are planning to stay here, all-inclusive does not include please and thank you to the staff. I was astonished at the attitude of some guests towards the staff – as I’ve already mentioned the staff want to make your stay the best it can be – saying please and thank to the staff does not cost you anything so remember to take your manners with you. Thank you to all the staff who looked after us so well. We can’t wait to return again.",positive

"Our planned highlight, to the end of our Sri Lankan tour, was a frustrating disappointment. We arrived tired and sick, hoping for a clean comfortable room and some simple food. Even though we had booked and paid 6 months earlier, it took a long time to allocate us a room. The room smelled of mould and mould was easily found in the bathroom. My wife complained, but all the staff could do was find the missing outdoor furniture. At dinner, the first night, we had difficulty finding plain food, that would not aggravate our upset stomachs. The chef kindly offered to prepare mashed potatoes, peas and grilled chicken, for us, the next night. However, the next day, this offer was undone by management, who declared we had been selected for ""Fine dining"". Fearing this was Sringlish for extra spicy, we gave up and went to bed early, without dinned, which we had already paid for. At least at checkout, as some compensation, the hotel did not charge for the sandwich and hamburger, we had at the bar. After my wife presented mouldy toiletries to management, they did offer to change rooms, on the second day; but it was too little too late. The hotel has an impressive entrance and sea view. But what good are those when the hotel fails the basics of room and food.",negative

"During our 4 weeks we had really a very nice time a part from some rain in the evening.Beachfront hotel large and well kept property, Room confortable with everything you need, rooms a little too dark in the evening.Towels and bedsheet in perfect conditions, rooms very clean.Staff kind and helpful also in the 2 pools, the pool attendents were always ready to give you new towels and to help you to change place when necessary.The food in the main restaurant , usually self service, is various and abundant, of course You must like oriental food, not accordingly to european tast, but very spicy, ( not strong or pure fire,) just spicy as a matter of fact the majority of the guest are arabs, indians, and other asian countries.For us italian was OK. Good entertainment afternoon and evening, fire works, shows , music etc.Something special was the man playing flute in the morning at the main pool.What was not good at all, was the great quantity of russian, ukrain and soviet people, noisy,arrogant,impolite, mainly dressed with shorts, shirts withouth sleeves and sandals, and all this at the main restaurant.

"My stay at Heritance Ahungalla was disappointing.

"One thing which makes Heritance Hotels stand out is the food and hospitality. So I had high expectations. I have already been to Kandalama and Negambo, in both cuisine and hospitality is great and flawless. The first thing I noted is that they (Heritance Ahungalla) cannot handle a crowd. No welcome drinks for some of the guests. Very few (sometimes none) food options to vegetarians. The restaurant space was not enough when crowded. Service is really bad at the restaurant. Several times we had to ask for water and wait for it. Both Negambo and Kandalama is excellent in service where they event do not let the water glass finish in any of the tables. So lot of improvement is needed. And it is noted that the service is delayed not because the staff is very busy, but because there are some idle staff as well. More organization is needed. Rooms are okay. The first day there were only one shower cap in the room. The other shower cap box is empty. On top of that, the second day, there were no soap. Even the soap from the previous day has been removed. Location is okay. Nice pools. If the main is crowded or sunny in the day you can use the other pools.",neutral
"We stayed for 6 nights at the Heritance Ahungulla. It's a nice hotel, we had a luxury double room facing the sea which was spacious and comfy bed. The only thing that lets this place down slightly is the food as you get a bit sick of it after a while, so definitely venture out of resort. Also, watch the hawkers out on the street if you go outside the gates to go to the local shop across the road. They are on you as soon as the gates are closed, asking you if you'd like to see gems, have massages or see spice gardens etc. One even tried to get in a tuk tuk with us, however we politely told him to get out. Good staff, but our room cleaner was hanging around us too much after we had tipped him one day; like he wanted more. Just made me feel a bit uneasy. Apart from that it was somewhere good to stay.",neutral

"My sister and I were really looking forward to ending our 9 day tour of Sri Lanka in an excellent 5 star hotel. To our dismay, we were presented by a hotel which should not be claiming it's 5 star label. A three star at best. It was by no means dirty, but very rough around the edges. It was in dire need of renovation. The room itself had nothing wrong with it, but no determining feature to tout it as a 5 star resort. The food was ok. Unfortunately, it was a big anticlimax for the end of our trip.",neutral
(+)Excellent location facing the beach with direct access. Two swimming pools make it less crowded. Staff very polite and helpful.

"When we i read the inital review for this hotel i read all about eh room that smelt of mold. Well imagine my amusement(not ) after God knows how many hours of travel we arrive....hotel looks lovely...we check in...all good. We get showed to our room - we get showed around and then everyone stands still as the expected tip needs to be handed over. Fine, not great but fine. I then start having an asthma attack, due to the strong smell of mold. Yep I've got the moldy room!!!! We ask to get moved, which was quick and efficient, but i was really annoyed when another tip was expected. At this point i have to say that ws one of my main annoyances about Sri Lanka. of course when you travel to a less fortunate country you expect to tip, but i got out hand. Anyway, hotel was ok...room was nice, good size, bathroom great...Again slight annoyance, they cleaned everyday, but i didn't always think it was that thorough-. The food was fabulous, although we never had the buffet dinner,we ate mainly (when at the hotel) at the 24 h place. the top resturant wasn't open as the hotel wasn't busy enough.Brekafast were wide ranging and very tasty no complaints here. Great gym. which no one uses and it has a fabulous views out to sea- it felt like my own personal gym. The views are great , and the beach is wonderful, never crowded . Once you've told the beach touts that you'll buy something they're pretty good and leave you alone. I'm not sure when they're adding it, but there is no Spa on site, somoen comes in to do massage. I went down the road Eden Hotel & Spa, which i would definitely recommend. Spa is lovely-and they have great food aswell if you want to go for dinner. On the whole the Heritage was lovely, did the job, just a few annoyance, but mainly good.",neutral

The team of Sampath ,Gamini and Thusara took care of us so well that we felt we were being spoilt . As I told them in the service industry this is what make the difference. I believe Heritance brand should not expand too fast and special attention should be paid to training and succession planing not forgetting staff retention . A lot of respect should be given to old staff who have been hardworking and loyal which is something I could notice in this hotel organization . Congratulations and all the best wishes.

"Absolutely wonderful! The resort was a tranquil haven set away from the busy main road and made you feel like you have just stepped into paradise. The hotel is beautifully laid out, allowing you to go from swimming in the pool to swimming in the ocean with just a few steps along a very private beach. The architecture is stunning. The hotel had a wide array of amenities like 2 pools (one with Jacuzzi), bars, restaurants, a library, tennis court, spa, putting green, gym, loads of games, etc which I felt made it ideal for either couples or families. There were always activities for both children and adults like mask painting, water aerobics, traditional dances, etc but they were unobtrusive, allowing you to either be entertained or just relax in peace around the pool, without being bothered. The rooms were beautiful, comfortable and cleaned spotlessly every day. The service was outstanding with smiling happy faces greeting you wherever you go. Nothing seemed too much trouble to do and they made you feel like you were part of the family, not just an anonymous guest. Special thanks to KK who made us feel like we were royalty every day and went out of his way to help us experience Sri Lankan culture. The food was spectacular with a wonderful mix of Sri Lankan and international dishes. We were mad about the Egg hoppers and wonderful Sri lankan curries with their endless choice of sambals, chutneys, pickles, pitu, etc. This is a wonderful escape that makes you feel absolutely pampered every step of the way.",positive

We would also like to thank the GM, the front office manager Indika and all the front office staff and special thanks to Chathuranga who organised kite flying for our 2 children. The food at this hotel is beyond words, it really is amazing. Compliments to the great chefs, Dimuthu Kumarasinghe and junior chef Dayananda. The chefs have recently won awards and we can totally agree that these awards are very well deserved. The hotel restaurant service is excellent and special thanks go to Mr Gamini and Thushara. Special thanks also go to Chamith and Raju the 2 Animation staff who entertained us with a variety of sports and activities for our children. Chamith and Raju are an asset to this hotel, they are both hard working with great personalities. The rooms we have had have always been super clean and spacious. The 2 swimming pools are both really big and always clean with excellent pool staff with great service. Thank you Heritance Ahungalla for a wonderful holiday. See you next year!

"As mentioned above the hotels seems to have changed its profile. The first thing that meets you after the majestic entry, that took my breath away the first time I came, is a large Russian banner. The hotel seems to accommodate huge groups of tourists from this country and many of them behave badly, bringing glass bottles into the pool, (drinking a lot in general) ignoring the personnel, treating the personnel like lesser beings (we saw this several times) and not greeting, making eye contact, or even acknowledging fellow hotel guests. I can understand that the world situation makes this awkward for them, but if you choose to travel out, you should make the effort- not expect to take over a beautiful tropical destination and ignore and cancel all others just by outnumbering them. I will not return to Heritance Ahungalla (the Triton to me) until this has changed. It was very expensive too, which is such a shame when the experience is so negative. I can understand the need to make money, but ruining such a beautiful hotel and experience along the way can hardly be worth it in the long run . I’m sure the architect Geoffrey Bawa would’ve hated this development!",negative
"We went quite some time ago. The resort was nice, staff was very friendly. The rooms were okay. The breakfast was good except for the tea and coffee. We tried the dinner buffet one night and that was not nice at all but we complained and got compensated. The pool areas were okay, lots of kids. Massages were decent. Luckily we had a car and driver so went around the area to Hikkaduwa etc to eat otherwise eating options at the resort were very limited",neutral

"The location on the beach is great, calm and scenic, close to the water. The hotel pool area is good and quite high level of service around the pool. Some days the pool area was not so quite that we had expected. Layout of the hotel is fine but it need some updating and I understand it will take place in April this year. Communication among staff was non existing, service quite low if you rate yourself as a 5 star hotel, which it is not compared to international standard. The food did not live up to a 5 star hotel standard, medium quality to quite high rates. Breakfast was rather chaotic and serice level among staff low. It seemed as staff wanted to delivery a good service but did not know how. Only on the very last day they checked in and ask how it was and if we were satisfied. Shops in the hotel area were very boring and expensive and far from 5 star hotel standard, recommend to either close or improve a lot. Wil go back to Sri Lanka but will chose antoher place to stay.",neutral

"We stayed here for 4 nights at the end of our Sri Lanka trip in 2 rooms.impressive driveway and entrance lobby and friendly greeting and check in .Rooms are large and had good views to the garden and towards the sea, well equipped and very clean with great service from our daily room attendant, although on arrival both rooms had cockroaches but he dealt with these swiftly and they did not reappear, comfortable beds and nice linens and towels. No signage to any of facilities such as gym. Great pools and very spacious gardens and lots of sun beds with good service from pool attendants.The major disappointment was the attitude of bar staff and some of restaurant staff to all inclusive guests, unfriendly and unhelpful to the point of rudeness! Why offer an all inclusive option and then treat these guests as second class citizens? We were frequently ignored in the bar area and bills presented in a manner which suggested you shouldn't order anymore! Totally spoilt what otherwise would have been a very pleasant stay.",negative

"We stayed here between 18-24 June 2007 for part of our 3 centre honeymoon and we were amazed by both the country and the hotel. We were greeted by the Duty Manager and a refreshing cold towel and shown to our rooms following a brief introduction to the hotel as well as a choice of cocktail or wine upon ones arrival. One thing to bear in mind from the momnet you arrive in the hotel, is that tipping is a necessity, 100-200 rupees (50p-£1) is adequate and you will find that you tip practically everyone, so make sure you have small denominations of GBP or USD. We stayed in a standard room over looking the pool and the Indian Ocean. The room was exceptionally clean, with a well-stocked mini bar and a tv with various satellite channels. The room boasted a well equipped en-suite, with a huge walk-in shower. The balcony was big with a table and two chairs which were much used when watching the sun set! The room had wooden floors and tiles in the bathroom and there was seating area within the room with a sofa and table. The pool areas were very clean with plenty of sun loungers around. Once you found the sun lounger of your choice a member of staff would bring towels and an umbrella if so required to you. The jacuzzi was not operational all the time, though that is partly due to the lack of clientele, although when it was turned on, there were very few people using it anyway. Periodically, the waiters would bring round refreshing water melon free of charge which was always welcomed. Waiters were also there if you wanted a drink that would then be brought to your sunlounger. Be wary, if you do get a sun lounger facing the sea, you are likely to be bombarded with the locals trying to sell you their goods. A polite shake of the head will move them on as they cause no harm. The hotel have tried to move on the sellers, but they rely on tourism so basically bear with it or move nearer the pool. Although we were half board at this hotel, it was easy to eat in the coffee shop which was excellent value for money and they had a good range of foods. The breakfast were good, with a wide variety which catered for most nationalities, including Sri Lankans themselves who tend to have Pol Sambol (a type of curry) for their breakfast. The evening meal tends to be a buffet, but as the hotel was pretty empty, we had most of our meals from the A La Carte menu which was excellent. On the occasion we did have the buffet, there was a great choice of barbequed meats and freshly cooked meals, all of very high standards. Dress code is smart /casual. The hotel was only 1/3 full as a result of the lack of tourism following the Tsunami and the Civil War, which is such a shame as a lot of staff had to be laid off as a result. The Civil War is taking place to the far North East of Sri Lanka and it was only on the way back to the airport late at night did we ever see army personnel as there are many check points to go through, but don't let this put you off as it doesn't affect you at all. As a result of the low numbers, the evening entertainment was null and void, although as a honeymooning couple, this did not bother us as it was nice to have a walk around or a couple of drinks in the bar before retiring to the room. That being said, the hotel was busy over the weekend and the evening entertainment did pick up. There is nothing about the hotel we would change. The staff are friendly and extremely attentive and they will go out of their way to help you. The hotel in our opinion was worth every penny and would recommend it to anyone. PLEASE don't be put off with the post-Tsunami clear up as we hardly saw any of it taking place, although the hotel is a constant reminder how strong these people are in the face of adversity. The only evidence that you will see in the immediate vicinity of the resort is the boutique on the beach and you can see where the waves ripped the walls apart. Go to the Heritance Ahungalla, it is wonderful and we certainly go back and it is certainly worthy of its 4* reputation.",positive

"We have just returned from a 2 week (all inclusive) stay at the Heritance and had a great time. Our room was a bit tired but I believe is due to be refurbished, some rooms already having been renovated. The hotel is in a good position on a lovely beach – great for a walk and it would take us just over an hour to walk to the far end and back. The sea is a bit rough for swimming in and the red flag was up for our entire stay, however it was good fun in the waves if you don’t go out your depth. There are 2 decent sized swimming pools and we never had any problem getting a sunbed. Being all inclusive, all our meals were taken in the buffet restaurant. However there is an a la carte and a fish restaurant if you fancy a change, although you would have to pay for these and there is no discount. We found there was plenty of variety on the buffet and the food was of an excellent quality with authentic local dishes and of course a wide choice of different curries (green pea/cashew and beetroot/potato were some of our favourites). All the staff were very friendly and efficient. The chap that cleaned our room (319) was excellent and the bed was always beautifully decorated with flowers. Jananjaya in the restaurant was always there to top up our drinks. When you first arrive and walk on the beach or go out the front gate you will be approached by people looking to sell you trips/tuk tuk rides. Whilst it can get a bit annoying they are definitely better value than the tour operator excursions. We had a taxi to the fort at Galle for £30 between the two of us and the driver waited for us, whereas the tour company were charging £55 each for a half day trip to Galle. We also took tuk tuks to Brief garden by Bevis Bawa and the Lunuganga Estate of Geoffrey Bawa, and they were some of the highlights of our trip. There is an ATM about a 10 minute walk up the road. One thing to be aware of at the airport when you leave Sri Lanka is that you cannot take bottled water onto the plane, even if you have purchased it in the departure lounge. Oh and by the way there is a public holiday when there is a full moon and no alcohol can be sold anywhere and is not available at the hotel.",neutral

"I was there in July 2018 with my newly married wife. We used to travel around a world (from Europe, Asia to South America) and what we have to admit - we are very positively surprised by the local people whom we met in Sri Lanka. We are stunned by the kindness and warmness of the hotel's Heritance Ahungalla crew who was always ready to help us, talk and exchange experineces about local specialities - such as food, places worth to see or even costs that we should planned while traveling on our own. We would like to higly recommend them: Vimukthi Ishan, Jagath Vimukthi, Anuruddhi Bandara and Danuka Rakitna - ketachen chef, that gave us recepie for the best Egg Hoper ever! Thanks to this people our trip was even more memorable.",positive
"We travelled with family on an outing, that had been planned a couple of months in advance. One of the members of our party is in a wheelchair and from the time of booking, this was mentioned as a special request. However, it was extremely difficult in getting confirmation from the hotel (both head office and hotel were contacted) if they were able to accommodate this guest. Several calls and emails went ignored and we resorted to calling a friend. This was extremely annoying as full paying customers you would like to think that the hotel would want to provide you with this basic service. A complaint made to the FB page provided some call back, but as always the trail went cold. We were unsure as to if this guest was able to make it, so in sheer desperation we had someone physically visit the hotel the week prior to our holiday and ask if they could be shown a few of the room categories, we were happy to upgrade if necessary. However, the person was not shown all categories and so the guest decided to only come for the day. Needless to say, we went there already disappointed with what the hotel had to offer. Once we checked in, we realised that one of our rooms was able to accommodate the guest in the wheelchair, and then proceeded to go to great lengths to ensure this guest joined us for the night. When we questioned the front desk as to why this room had not been shown to us, we were not given a valid response and we let it be, as we felt like we had already exerted way too much effort in what was meant to be a relaxing holiday! Needless to say, I felt like reservations, front desk and the head office staff were negligent and incompetent in this regard. Thereafter our trip went along smoothly, the staff were friendly and courteous and cooperated with requests such as bringing out a birthday cake. The rooms were clean and the common areas pleasant. It is a decent family hotel. The food was average at best, with no real highlights. Nice enough for a holiday with kids, but not good enough to compensate for all the hassle with the levels of initial service rendered.",negative

"I checked this hotel at tripadvisor before booking it and expected it to be nice and relaxing at the very least, however, the whole stay (we stayed there for 3 weeks) was a complete and utter disappointment! Looks like Heritance has changed a lot lately and it's surely not a 5* hotel anymore. After an almost 20-hour trip to the hotel, my only wish was to have a shower and lie down, however, we had to spent almost half an hour answering stupid questions about our anniversary, etc. The staff was too talkative and tactless even, several times we had spend almost the entire lunch in their company and nothing could possibly make them leave. All the advantages of this place faded away in comparison with its negative sides. Quite nice design of the room couldn't make up for holes in bedsheets, dirty curtains, breaking conditioning, old towels and other things. The food was really fabulous, however, when the evening food was under a set menu, almost all guest opted for the a la carte restaurant as the set menu was really poor and the meal lasted forever. The atmosphere was quite relaxing most of the time, however, there was no chance to even enter the pool as soon as weekend came and the hotel was fully packed with locals. Some things kept on spoiling our stay on every day basis. The beach area was constantly full of locals, who were trying to sell you a trip or whatever you wanted or didn't wanted. Even by the pool your every single movement was followed by their attempts to draw your attention. If you managed to escape and reach the ocean, several guys were waiting for you to come back. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! For the first time in my life I was looking forward for going home!!",negative
The place was nice with beautiful views. The food was good but overpriced. Also the service was slow in the cafe. I think it was too expensive for the place and to charge almost 3500 lkr for a dinner buffet that had a great salad & dessert bar but the main foods was very limited. I am pretty sure they do not have generators because when the power was out there was backup current. I would recommend that you take a walk down to the beach and take a right to white villa restaurant or take a left to Jungle beach to eat. White Villa has an amazing lookout oint for a sunset....,neutral
"I had a twin room which was very good but maybe would be a bit on the small size for two people. The bed was very comfortable, there was a desk with a reading lamp in the corner. The bathroom was small but fine for just me. There is a big pool very close to, and overlooking the beach and sea. The sea has too many waves to swim in but good for splashing around and having a bit of fun in. There is not much outside the property but there is a jewellery shop across the road with a very helpful and genuine owner and a wine shop to the right who will rip you off with ""tourist prices"". To get further afield the hotel does offer taxis but they are expensive. I enquired about Bentota and it was $23 return, another couple got a Tuk Tuk and ""negotiated"" the price down to 700 SLR abut £3.50. Obviously the car is more comfortable, your choice. The food and the staff are very good. If you want to eat elsewhere there are a couple of places on the beach on right of the property.",neutral
"Hello .

"We have just returned from a fabulous 2 week honeymoon in Sri Lanka. We had stayed in 3 fab places before our final stop at The Heritance. From looking at the website and booking the holiday through a luxury travel agent, it looked like it was going to be a lovely retreat to relax in for 5 days. Unfortunately this wasn’t quite the case... I had e-mailed and Facebook messaged the hotel the day before arrival. I asked whether they had any suites or some of their best rooms available to upgrade to, as we were on our honeymoon and wished for something extra special. The responded via Facebook asking for my e-mail address so that they could forward information on. I responded and I didn’t get anything back. I then e-mailed them directly-nothing back again!! Nothing was said on check in...no special greeting...nothing. We were taken to our room, I told the lady taking us there that I had e-mailed and wanted to make sure we got a sea view. She was quite dismissive. When we got to our room, it was ground floor level taking us straight out to the pool. You could hear the sea, but defiantly couldn’t see it. The room was pleasant enough-modern with a big bed but definatly not 5 star. There was a congratulations cake on the table to great us (we had one at most places we stayed to be honest). But that was the only thing we got to feel special. No one asked whether we would like to organise a special dinner etc etc. As the cake was so big, it was going to take us several days to eat it. Housekeeping could have taken it away and put it in the fridge, but instead it was left out on the side to attract ants. We were just overall a bit disappointed...it was defiantly more of a family hotel and there were kids everywhere the whole weekend we were there and breakfast was crazy-we thought that the hotel was opening up the restaurant and pool to non residents at the weekend. The restaurant needs a facelift for sure as it again did not feel like 5* dining. At breakfast we always waited patiently to be seated, once seated the waitress or waiter would hurry off without asking whether we would like tea or coffee. I then had to try and grab someone’s attention again so it basically took 15 minutes to get a hot drink. A little poor for 5*. We had lunch via room service a couple of days and that was pleasant enough-very little choice but if you like chips and sandwiches then it’s fine. They had no samosas and very few of the wines on the extensive wine list on show. I had to chose 3 different wines before finally getting the 4th one I asked for. Also if you like cocktails, you will be disappointed as the ones I had at the hotel were not very nice. We only ate dinner in the restaurant once during our 5 night stop, as we decided we would get better service and food elsewhere. The fine dining restaurant had no people in on any of the nights we were there and we just couldn’t think of anything worse than the madness of that buffet restaurant again. Where the staff were in attentive and miserable. Sorry Heritance but we just expected more I’m sorry. And to top it all off we got a phone call the morning of check-out just to make sure we were checking out on time or if we had booked a late check out. And a bill pushed through the door the night before. Come on...it was low season, hotel was not busy at all and we were on our honeymoon. Every morning we were woken at 5am by noisy people checking out of their rooms or walking in high heels right above our bedroom. With being on the ground floor, we were right on the main drag for people moving around. If we had been higher up with a lovely sea view, then we would have hopefully had some peace and quiet.",negative

"Our stay at this property was 9 nights during our holidays and we wouldn't have expected much from this hotel's overall experience if the grading system of this hotel was honest about being below a 4 star. Despite the general friendliness of staffs at the hotel, there is absolutely nothing to recommend about this hotel if you are expecting it to be a 5 star. From: - trying to put us in a lower category room (which we didnt book through Agoda) - bathroom amenities were never refilled and replaced - what 5 star hotel does 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner??? - room walls were made paper thin and it didnt help they placed us beside the housekeeping room and we heard every clamour there were starting from 7am every morning - bed sheets looked and felt like it was 30 years old from the stains and the lint built-up which was made to feel like climbing into rough potato sack fabric. - on the swimming/lounging private part of the property they allowed hagglers still on the property to haggle guests to buy products or their services.

"Our stay in this hotel was most enjoyable. All staff worked hard to make our holiday enjoyable. Our room was very comfortable with a sea view. The hotel, grounds and pools are well designed, particularly the main pool. The team of pool attendants are the most helpful I have ever encountered in any hotel in the world. I would certainly recommend this hotel however there is one issue I would suggest the hotel management team consider and that relates to noise from the pool activities and the lounge bar. The hotel has two pools - the one in front of reception is the one seen in all their promotional materials and is beautiful. However, it gets very noisy as a result of very loud music associated with activitites in the pool including aqua aerobics. This mirrors the experience of another reviewer jennymartyn. There is a second pool on the property which is not quite as stunningly beautiful but is still a nice pool. However, the noise from the main pool travels and that spoiled our enjoyment on a couple of occaisions. We prefer to listen to the sound of the waves on the beach and the noise of the birds in the trees not head-banging noise from aqua-aerobics and beach based activities. A big thank you to staff including reception staff (can't remember all their names), Vishme (guest relations), housekeeping and pool staff for trying so hard to meet our needs.",neutral

"We booked our 2 day stay after reading the good reviews but were a bit unsure if we would get the same watered down treatment we received in a hotel in Sri Lanka which had good reviews from foreign tourists and where we stayed last year. Although living in Australia for 22 years we do not exactly have a ""foreign"" accent, having been born in Sri Lanka we speak the local language which gives us away to the local staff who generally love to pamper the foreign tourists only. What impressed us in this hotel was that the staff made no distinction between the local tourists and the visitors from overseas, and we were well looked after from the time we arrived. Checking in was very friendly, no standing at the reception, but a staff member escorted us to a sitting area and we were offered a choice of freshly squeezed fruit juice. While we enjoyed our complimentary wood apple juice, we were checked in by the staff member. After we finished our drink, we were actually escorted to our room by this staff member who conversed with us in perfect English and told us about the hotel amenities. We had booked a luxury room with balcony and ocean view, and the room was very comfortable. We enjoyed the view from our balcony usually after waking up in the morning, sipping a cup of tea before heading down to the restaurant for breakfast. The food was really good, the restaurant staff smiled as they approached us. We were even asked to let them know if there was anything we would like to have that was not in the menu, and they did actually oblige with my wife's request for grilled seer fish on Kebab night. We were hoping for a quiet relaxed stay during the middle of the week away from busy Colombo where we had spent most of our Sri Lankan holiday, and we had exactly that. The only thing that wasn't to our liking was the persistence of the hawkers on the beach. My wife bought a sarong that looked quite nice from one of them, however this appeared to be a mistake because that enticed the rest of them to keep following us although we very firmly told them we were not interested in buying something from each one of them. Probably there was nothing much the hotel could do about them. Just one other thing and this is about the bathroom. This was very spacious and we liked it very much, however, the louvered blind on the glass wall adjacent to the bath tub wouldn't shut properly. Not quite sure if this is a deliberate gesture by the management to promote intimacy between couples using this room!",neutral

"I have such mixed feelings about this hotel but I’m confident in saying that this is not up to the standards of a 5 star. We stopped here for the last week of our 2 week trip to Sri Lanka for our honeymoon and on arrival to the hotel from the lobby/main gates it looked exceptional! On arrival to our “deluxe” room we were instantly disappointed. The room apparently had just been refurbished which I found really hard to believe. The shower was covered in limescale and the room was tiny. After a bit of a battle we were finally allocated another room. This room was slightly bigger but the bathroom was once again the bathroom was again covered in limescale, half decorated, very basic and we couldn’t see anything deluxe or 5 star about it. Earlier in the week we stayed in a deluxe room at a sister hotel ‘Heritance Kandalama’ and the room there had an amazing view, whirlpool bath & amazing decor… so as you can imagine we were really disappointed with this room. I’ve attached a couple of photos for reference too. The food was really really good at the buffet and snack bar and we thought the verity of alcohol provided on the all inclusive was good. The staff were friendly but there wasn’t enough staff and they couldn’t keep up with how many people were there. I personally wouldn’t recommend to anyone looking for luxury to stay here and agree with the below comments that this is an equivalent of a European 3 star hotel. Finally, it seems that the management and staff prioritise the returning customers which is such a shame as if they put the effort in to new customers (especially ones who have spent a considerable amount of money on honeymoons) too along with a few touch ups, they’d receive better reviews.",negative
"At the entrance to the hotel there was a big advertising board claiming to have the best culinary team in the island, since another tourist recommended the food here we booked in for lunch as a special treat. It was a buffet priced at over £27 per couple which is quite expensive compared to normal Sri Lankan standards, considering all the hype we were expecting a grand lunch to remember. We were tempted by the grilled seafood skewers as a starter and this was the beginning of the worst meal in Sri Lanka ever. We could not eat them they were stale and tough as old boots. I decided to go for the main course and on the way noticed to my horror the cause of the awful starters the chef was taking out old cooked seafood skewers from a container and putting them back on the hot grill. The main course did not impress one bit the meat curry was stale and very dry, the vegetables were overcooked. The desserts were awful and the only good thing served here was what they did not prepare themselves"" the curd & honey"". During our meal we requested to see the chef to make a complaint regarding this terrible food. Finally a gentleman appeared at our table who was unable to give us any satisfactory explanation. We ordered coffee and guess what it was stale and lukewarm. By then we were fuming and demanded to see the manager who was very apologetic and requested us to come back that evening for a meal on him, how kind. He even charged us in full for the worst meal we had in Sri Lanka. Do you think we went back that evening for another repeat performance on the house, ""Hell no"". Do not be fooled by false advertising claims when you can get a much better meal from any roadside cafe for less than £8 for two.",negative
"The hotel looks lovely and the rooms are very nice - large, airy and tastefully furnished in a modern take on traditional. Wonderful big comfortable bed, excellent rain shower, big flat screen TV, minbar, generous safe and covered private balcony. Public areas are open plan and also look very nice - until you spot the package operator signs & programs, hear the scream of children in the pool (right beside the only bar & lounge) and realise the predominant language is Russian. Service is hit and miss - there are some excellent staff who cannot do enough to please, but there is also a lot of inexperience and a shortage of staff for the number of guests - leading to some extremely poor service experiences (eg. Wine ordered at dinner not arriving until after dessert; dirty plates left on tables for long periods; tables not properly cleaned between use; buffet dishes not replenished; etc.) The food quality in the buffet is poor - tough cuts of meat, over cooked curries and left out/not refreshed very often. Even at the fresh food stations the ingredients were not top quality and over cooked - and at best all the dishes are luke warm. Breakfast was no better - some good curries, but otherwise heavy doughy croissants, ‘butter’ that was in fact margarine, a couple of cheap jams, limited selection of fruit and one person cooking eggs and another cooking hoppers for the 100s of guests. To round it off - the majority of the wine list was unavailable (excuse being difficulty with supply chain due to pandemic - but the other hotels on our tour hadn’t suffered the same problems), as were a number of items on the pool bar snack menu. The sl a carte restaurant and the other bars / coffee shop weren’t open either. Definitely not a five star experience.",negative

"This is our third trip to heritance ahungalla and had a really poor customer service. First we had to wait for more than 15 minutes for our welcome drink since lot of foreigners arrived just AFTER us and had to remind 3 staff members. we went only for lunch buffet and while entering the dining hall our tickets were checked, but while we were dining one lady approached us and wanted to know our room number, so we told we are here only for lunch. Then she again wanted to see our tickets one by one while we were having lunch giving the impression we havent paid. we were amazed by this 5 star treatment. This not what we are expecting after paying Rs 3500 per adult. we will never come back to this place.",negative

"This is a lovely hotel in many ways but it isn't quite good enough to get a ""very good"". It seemed very expensive for what one got but that may be because we booked a suite directly with the hotel. I suspect many of the hotel guests had booked via tour operators and got a considerably better deal than we got. We were shocked by the average age of the guests which must have been 60+. Don't come here expecting a wild or exciting time! The setting is lovely and the beach is good. The waves are wonderful to play in but they are very strong and only for confident swimmers. The food was of a high quality and reasonably priced although breakfast was a little disappointing. Staff were well meaning but often inept. I once asked for bread 5 times before we got any. We could see the bread baskets in the restaurant ready to be given to diners but the waiters just didn't seem able to serve us (there was only one other table dining in the restaurant so the waiters were not rushed off their feet). We also asked for the bill only to be ignored for 15 minutes (despite being the only people in the restaurant by then). When we asked again, we were met with a blank look and a lack of comprehension. In the end, we said we were going to our room and asked if they could send the bill to us there? The bill never arrived although we were charged for the meal so someone managed to sort things out. At breakfast, we wanted to sit outside as the restaurant was very gloomy. There was only one umbrella between about 20 tables so we would sit in the shade which sometimes necessitated moving the table a little or turning it so we weren't in the sun. Quite often, the staff would then move the table back whilst we were serving ourselves at the buffet. We would then move it again. Also, I asked the chef making omelettes if I could have poached eggs and he had no idea what they were. Fortunately, another chef did and went and organised them for me in the kitchen (they were cooked perfectly). Having said all of that, the staff were lovely and wanted to please. The Valentine's dinner was great. It had the perfect level of cheesy entertainment (the dancers were hamming it up brilliantly), the food was very good and the staff couldn't do enough to please. The beds are very uncomfortable so do consider that if bed comfort is important to you. It was like sleeping on wooden boards. We had a good holiday here but it really wasn't worth what we paid.",neutral
"I was in Sri Lanka for the second time. Prior to this trip would never have believed that Sri Lanka has such a luxurious hotel with a very kind and responsive staff.

If you have forgotten something - be sure to bring in, do not steal. Very good food, I recommend HB",positive

"A country full of lovely friendly people with happy smiling faces. Their delightfully naive view of life being that if they give something a 5* rating then it must be so. The problem is that prices have gone up to international 5* levels giving rise to the expectation that it will compare to other high graded hotels around the world. This maybe one of a group of Sri Lankan higher quality hotels but no way is it as 5* by INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS. At best it is a low 4*/high 3*. The entrance is spectacular and beautiful but the rest of the property is simply awful. Poor maintenance, unsafe tiles around the pools, under equipped rooms with intermittent electrical supplies and poor drainage. Hawkers on the beach screaming for your attention every time you go anywhere near them. Nobody walking around with any frequency to see if would like a drink whilst sunbathing etc. It could be so good if only they understood what makes a 5* hotel. Still delightful and enjoyable providing you don't go expecting the best, but it is poor value for money.",negative
"Room was decent, nothing fancy. Beachfront was nothing to die for. There are so many better beaches in southern coastline of Sri Lanka. The let down was how the hotel staff discriminate between dark skin people and white skin people. Initially I thought it was a mistake, then a coincidence when differential treatment continued and then understood it is a systemic issue in this facility. All 3 of us had experiences that we can relate to. Also, they make you wear a wrist band during your stay: reminds me of a hospital admission. Perhaps, they cannot remember that you are a hotel guest without having the band.",neutral
First time in Sri Lanka but have done Goa so knew what to expect The heritance hotel in AHungala is former five star colonial styled hotel set in beautiful grounds with a magnificent beach golden sands which stretches for miles The rooms are comfortable and clean the staff are extremely friendly and the service is great The buffet style restaurant offers good selection but it gets bit boring if your there for two weeks as we’re We went for the all inclusive package which is a bit of a joke as apparently all inclusive does not include a whole list of things inc wine at the bar use of the merge sports facilities anything from the mini bar etc. The main problem with the hotel is it’s loaction once you walk out of the heavily guarded front gates you are straight onto the main columbo to Galle Road The reality of Sri Lanka hits you with a vengeance the local village is a ram shackle mess of half finished buildings with rubbish piled up everywhere The road itself is a constant stream of horn blowing buses lorries car taxis and the famous TUk TUk Not the picturesque photos seen in the holiday brochures It’s also a long way from the main tourist triangle where the main temples and sigara rock are located We did the two day trip the return journey was six and half hours mainly stuck in traffic not pleasant I was ever to return to Sri Lanka I would certainly choose the location of the hotel so as to be closer to the sights maybe week in Kandy the week at the beach,negative

"1. The hotel did not reply my inquiries I sent via booking.com. Unlike other hotels I booked via booking.com, they always replied within 24 hours. 2. In contrast, they charged the room fee one day before I arrived based on the credit card info left here. My experience is the credit card is used for guarantee while other (5 stars) hotels will check with me my payment preferences when I check in. They can charge me via credit card if I didn’t show up in the end. 3. I asked if I can have late check-out at 12:30 one night before checkout date. Hotel staff just told me she can’t confirm it right now and asked me to check again the next day morning. My feeling is they don’t care customer satisfaction but care more abt their occupancy rate as this is 5 star hotel, which they probably think they can always get sufficient tourists to stay. 4. Lastly, some staff i.e breakfast time is less patient.",negative

They had variety of food . Yesterday [ Friday ] was Sri Lankan night . We enjoyed our meals very well . We could taste different traditional Sri Lankan sweet meats . We enjoyed the king coconut drink with lemon grass the most . Finally we saw a troop of kandyan dancers . The restaurant manager Mr. Praveen and G.M Mr .

"The Problem with Hotels on the East coast, is that they are close to the main road. Less than 20 meters. This means you cannot get away from the noise of the buses and hooting that is so prevelant in the country. Heritance is more than 200 m away from the road and therefore away from the hussel and bussel of the surrounding area. You acutally feel like you are in a quiet tropical location. You hear the birds and natural noises. The Hotel itself is stunning, Geoff Bawa, the architect definately got the right balance between building and embracing nature. The nutaral colours the blending of building with nauture is appreciated. The beaches are clean and there is a lot of beach to cover so you do not feel onto of other tourists there. The waves were fun and water temp pefrect. The only blemish is the constant harrassment of locals trying to sell you clothing or go to their resturants. The staff are excellent and well trained. They did a lot for us in terms of assisting with our wedding and went further than requested in seeing that our wedding was as beautiful and romantic as dreamed. Thank you. It also helped that the level of English was good, so communication was not a problem. Heritance can handle all element s of arranging a wedding so there was no need for a wedding planner. They even have celebrety cheif, so meals were of high standard. . Prior to coming to Heritance we were originally in Hikaduwa, which was not that great. We are not surfer, lonely planet travellers, which I felt Hikaduwa was catering for. We are in our mid thirties with our priorities at (quiet, cleanliness, beauty and a level of comfort a lady expects at this age). The prices in Hikaduwa for Hotels was not in proportion to what you were getting. Heritance was more expensive but you got what you paid for and the website is not misleading in terms of quality of rooms and the look of the hotel. We found a number of hotels in Hikaduwa misleading on their websites. Therefore Heritance was our saviour! We also recommend Heritance for a family holiday. As a kid I would of had blast swimming in the sea and swimming in both pools, one of which has a beautiful tree covering it. Lots of activities in the hotel and surrounding area. We have been to Sri Lanka three times and if I was to go back, I would only go back to Heritance to the calm and beauty of the place. Use Heritence web site to book. You get the best prices there. Dont be afraid to negociate an upgrade once you get there. You might be surprised.",positive

"My recent stay at Heritance Ahungalle was an absolute memorable one. On October 21st 2019, I was proposed to by my now finance, Tim Thatcher Tim worked with my parents and the amazing staff at the resort to organize a memorable evening for me and my whole family. We had beautiful rooms, food and entertainment for the evening. Especially, the staff helped organize and execute the proposal by providing us with an intimate space, a spectacular four course candle lit dinner (with a specialized menu featuring our event), full table service, photographers, flower arrangements and overall wonderful hospitality. I want to express my sincere gratitude to the team at Heritance Ahungalle, Mr. Rasika (F&B manager) Mr. Thushara (Restaurant Manager), Mr. Sisira (GM) and their teams for allowing us to execute Tim's vision. It was a very special day surrounded by my friends and family and it wouldn't have been a possibility without the support of this team.

"When we hear the name Heritance of Aitken Spence, we usually consider it to be one of the most exciting stays. But unfortunately it is a shame to the so called brand Heritance and as well as for the Aitken Spence. We went there for our annual gathering of my workplace and we have reserved about 19 rooms for the last weekend. please find the following: Welcome: They have warmly welcomed us and given the rooms on time. It is appreciated since we got the rooms just within half an hour. Rooms: The room given to me and my wife was on the third floor. Right at the moment we stepped in to the room we felt that it was not cleaned properly. Basically it was not swept at all for weeks as we felt. We were not even provided with the bathrobes to the rooms. Further, only two towels were available at the room and not even the face towels were placed. Bathroom amenities were so old and an immediate renovation should be taken place. One of the Tea/Coffee mugs in the room was not washed (Pictures attached). Buffet: Only one restaurant in operation or only one restaurant is available. It was totally crowded. Dinner on 26th Sept 2020: Restaurant was fully crowded. They do not provide at least the enough seating capacity for the guests. If I'm not mistaken, there were two other groups checked-in to the hotel during that day. However they have arranged some tables outside the restaurant where they were not attended by a single restaurant staff member just to refill their water goblets. Food was totally bad and had a very bad experience with the so called Sri Lankan Chicken Kottu Roti. It was totally frozen andwas not tasty at all. I have complained but the only answer I got from the so called F&B Manager or the Guest Services Representative was 'Will inform and will check with the chef'. Is that an answer from a so called hotel chain like Heritance by Aitken Spence??? Restaurant staff were not capable of attending to the guests and could not even clean the buffet frequently. Please find the attached pictures of the Ice Cream corner. Breakfast on 27th Sept 2020: Compared to the dinner on previous night, this was slightly okay. But they failed arrange the seating for the whole set of occupents. Lunch on 27th Sept 2020: Again it was horrible and had nothing to eat at all. We went for lunch around 1.30pm and even on that time they are out of some food. They had a bowl with a name tag 'Chicken Sausages' and only a half of a sausage is left. When I asked for 4 sausages to me & my wife, the guy came and noted our table and promised to bring them to our table. But unfortunately I couldn't see him afterwards. When it comes to desserts corner, there were nithing to eat at all and please refer the pictures attached. No more refilling or serving and the time was 2.35pm. Premises: There was a very bad smell in the whole hotel from the evening to the noon of the next day. When inquired, they said it is from the sea. But please note that this is not the only hotel we visted in the sea side and we have no any kind of an experience from the rest of the hotels we visited. I have never being to a Heritance Hotel before and I hope that the rest of the Heritance hotels would not be like this. Personally, I'm so disappointed with the hotel and I didn't expect this kind of a service and an experience from you guys. Lack of staff, does not mean that you are free from providing the five star hospitality. If you don't have the sufficient staff, please do not accept so much of bookings for a day. In my opinion, you should pay more attention to the above in order to provide a better experience to the people who visit Heritance Ahungalla. Further, especially in this period, you all are surviving just because of the locals. I'm truly disappointed and also feel very sad. By the way, Good Luck!",negative

"We had booked this hotel some time ago, as part of a package with the parent company, Aiken Spence. The trip was paid for and confirmed. We arrived at around 1pm on the scheduled day, to be told the hotel was overbooked, and that we were to go to a smaller hotel 2km away. They apologised but offered no compensation. We had to demand to see the new hotel (we were told the room would be a suite, it wasn't). We had no call previously. The front desk people were very keen to move us along rather than ensure we were satisfied with the arrangements. Only after a displeased call to aitken spence were we offered recompense- half board at the hotel and a room upgrade, when we arrived there the next day. This practice of overbooking at hotels in Sri Lanka is not unheard of, but ought to be discouraged. Our advice would be to call the hotel to confirm yourself, and, if it happens, don't leave until you have spoken with the manager. This is a very shoddy way to treat paying guests. Apologies don't cut it, especially when over bookings are either deliberate or easily avoided,",negative

"We stayed here for 2 nights with high expectation, but were a bit disappointed about the in room facility. The room is a bit old, the electric water pot was quite dirty. The tooth mug was dirty with crack, the shower gel container also had crack and without a cap. I don't expect all these for a 5 star hotel! Speaking of service particularly the restaurant serving the buffet. It takes me several attempt to refill the coffee and got the plates collected. The waitress saw us and not responding. However, they are responding proactively to non Chinese. This gave me a sense of discrimination! Despite the negatives, the swimming pool is fantastic. It faces the Indian Ocean which is awesome!",neutral
"Hotel ambiance itself was very relaxing. The check in process was taking bit of a time, but that was not much of a problem as we had time to lool around the property. I would say that the staff were not too open to help. They mostly replied with a negative sense. The buffet spread was amazing. They have a separate vegetarian corner that is easy to figure out. Nothing to be blamed of the taste.It was amazing. The main pool is a bit too opened to the lobby. The second pool is lovely. The highlight is the warm water jacuzzi that is there near the pool. The rooms were too clustered and badly need refurbishment. In one of the rooms we had the lock was broken. The water pressure in the shower was too much. Lastly I would say that the guests must have their freedom to review the hotel after their stay. I feel it is very wrong to force a review. May be they can suggest to leave a review on tripadvisor, but it is not required for the staff to download it on the guest's phone and wait till the review is posted. If this happens please get a moment off and tell them you will go back and post a review.",neutral

"We were in rooms 209 and 210. Pros: - well laid out and planned hotel - swimming pool area is beautiful - proximity to beach lovely Cons: - hardly any lights in room-very dim - run down - wifi not too great - very sparse room-not even a coffee table! - kettle had a calcified or corroded heating element so we did not want to take a chance with boiling water for our morning coffee. While it was well camouflaged, there was no plug point attached to the kettle so it would had to be physically moved near a plug point to operate-bad design. - bathroom has windows with only dusty, uneven Venetian blinds for so-called privacy - floor was dirty with dirt stuck on it - room was smelling musty when we came in. Couldn't leave balcony door open for too long to air, due to mosquitoes. - no room numbers written on key card envelopes-had to go out the door to check! - no in-hotel numbers written near the phone - cobwebs on balcony panels-rubber coming off - hotel information papers in the binder were not in order-pages missing. - no in-room menu in room. - checking in took time and we were shown a seating area that was impractical to sit in as sofas were not placed opposite of each other but next to each other. We stood around for about 10-15 mins and no one even asked us to take a seat at another more practical area which was close by. - the man showed us everything in the room but to omitted to show us the balcony! We could not see it as it had opaque sliding type panels that covered the sliding windows - the towels and sheets did not smell fresh - hardly any vegetarian options in the menu to warrant the money so the only options were a la carte in the coffee shop and that were going to take 45 mins to order. That hardly seems fair for vegetarians, does it? Since there was no other option, we ordered 3 western choices from this menu. Unfortunately, we were disappointed with the quality and taste of all the options. The veg lasagne had pasta that was chewy, the pasta primavera had peas that were raw and the potato and bean 'pie' was in fact not a pie at all-just potatoes, onions and beans topped with cheese! - The place needs a lot of maintenance.which it wasn't getting - staff need to improve their English, esp since there are so many non srilankans visiting-language was definitely a barrier esp when it came to ordering food. - staff need to be better trained to know what the hotel offers-boy who showed us to rooms said we could get a la carte in the dining hall. Instead there was only a buffet and no a la carte. - in our room, 210, we had no locking system in the door inside the room-no latch or knob, so ostensibly, the master key could be used to open the door at any time from the outside, even while we are inside the room - no tissues in tissue box in room 209-poor housekeeping - took 20 mins and reminding a few times to get our coffee at breakfast - took a long time for the dirty plates piled up from the buffet breakfast to be cleared. Had to point it out. Sadly, the cons far outweighed the pros. I would not stay here again unless it undergoes a major restructuring.",negative
