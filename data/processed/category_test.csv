"I thought the ""fine dining"" restaurant was disappointing and over-priced. The hotel felt too ""Buckland's Holiday Camp"" for me. Couldn't wait to leave each day on other activities outside the hotel. It looked to me also that the original building design had been messed with. The model airplane at the end of the 'infinity"" pool was ridiculous.

"When I walked in the lobby, it was very crowede and noisy, I saw the swimming pool from lobby, it was as crowded as disneyland, I cannot believe this is a 5 star hotel. And the swimming pool was somehow under maintance, can see the view as saw on the website. No bath tub in the bathroom. My flight was 12 noon, so I had an early breakfast at 7:20am, the breakfast time started at 7am, but it was chaos when I walked in the restaurant, staff in the restaurant were chatting, laughing, there's no Professional at all!! I was sooo disappointed at Heritance Ahungalla hotel!!!",Rooms,when i walked in the lobby it wa very crowede and noisy i saw the swimming pool from lobby it wa a crowded a disneyland i can not believe this is a star hotel and the swimming pool wa somehow under maintance can see the view a saw on the website no bath tub in the bathroom my flight wa noon so i had an early breakfast at am the breakfast time started at am but it wa chaos when i walked in the restaurant staff in the restaurant were chatting laughing there no professional at all i wa sooo disappointed at heritance ahungalla hotel,573,106

"The hotel needs refurbishment.  Some of the corridors and courtyards were in a very poor state. The meals were OK, although not up to 5 star standard. There was only one ala carte restaurant. The restaurant staff were a credit to the hotel - always willing to help. Unfortunately,  cant say the same of the reception staff who would benefit from a communication skills training course.  The Gym was very poorly equipped and certainly did not merit a 5 star status.",Recreation,the hotel need refurbishment some of the corridor and courtyard were in a very poor state the meal were ok although not up to star standard there wa only one ala carte restaurant the restaurant staff were a credit to the hotel always willing to help unfortunately cant say the same of the reception staff who would benefit from a communication skill training course the gym wa very poorly equipped and certainly did not merit a star status,464,81
"We felt we could not relax whilst in the grounds, the local sellers both men and women, hid in the bushes of the hotel on the beach, waiting to get people's attention.  As soon as you stepped onto the beach, you were surrounded by them.  Also so much rubbish strewn about the perimeter.  Overall the hotel lacked any atmosphere, maybe it is too large for that?
The staff were all lovely and friendly.  For the money we both felt very let down, it is marked as a 5 star hotel but I would disagree with that.",Services,we felt we could not relax whilst in the ground the local seller both men and woman hid in the bush of the hotel on the beach waiting to get people attention a soon a you stepped onto the beach you were surrounded by them also so much rubbish strewn about the perimeter overall the hotel lacked any atmosphere maybe it is too large for that the staff were all lovely and friendly for the money we both felt very let down it is marked a a star hotel but i would disagree with that,507,96

We were loking forward to staying at this hotel on the coast as we were not travelling to the Maldives.  However we were dissapointed with the service and food during our stay. The only savibg grace was being upgraded and the room we got was fantastic. The hotel is set in a great location but if you do not  like being hasseled on the so called private beach then this hotel is not for you. There were many locals on the beach trying to sell guests goods in full view of the scurity guards. However the security guards did not stop this from happening and we will not be returning to this hotel.,Food,we were loking forward to staying at this hotel on the coast a we were not travelling to the maldives however we were dissapointed with the service and food during our stay the only savibg grace wa being upgraded and the room we got wa fantastic the hotel is set in a great location but if you do not like being hasseled on the so called private beach then this hotel is not for you there were many local on the beach trying to sell guest good in full view of the scurity guard however the security guard did not stop this from happening and we will not be returning to this hotel,596,113
