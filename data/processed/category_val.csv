We were loking forward to staying at this hotel on the coast as we were not travelling to the Maldives.  However we were dissapointed with the service and food during our stay. The only savibg grace was being upgraded and the room we got was fantastic. The hotel is set in a great location but if you do not  like being hasseled on the so called private beach then this hotel is not for you. There were many locals on the beach trying to sell guests goods in full view of the scurity guards. However the security guards did not stop this from happening and we will not be returning to this hotel.,Food,we were loking forward to staying at this hotel on the coast a we were not travelling to the maldives however we were dissapointed with the service and food during our stay the only savibg grace wa being upgraded and the room we got wa fantastic the hotel is set in a great location but if you do not like being hasseled on the so called private beach then this hotel is not for you there were many local on the beach trying to sell guest good in full view of the scurity guard however the security guard did not stop this from happening and we will not be returning to this hotel,596,113
