"Comparing this hotel to other Heritance properties it falls well below. The facilities are good and the hotel is ok. In every area of the hotel, staff seemed a little directionless. When we arrived the checkin process was disorganised. Everyone was quite pleasant but just not efficient. At the pool bar we had 3 waiters just walk straight past us. The person who seemed to be the head waiter was standing there checking his mobile phone. Eventually we had to ask to be served. On the pool deck no one was offering service. We had to go hunt it down. Some people were staying here on an ""all inclusive"" package which may explain the poor service. The buffet was ""unloved"". I'd often open a closh to find it empty underneath - eg no sausages or bacon at 8.30am during breakfast. The staff at this hotel had poor English skills and it was often difficult to be understood.

Post the checkin, our ordeal just began to rear its head. Of the 5 rooms we were provided, 3 of them were with twin beds when it was clear to the hotel that were were couples. Then further, of the 5 rooms, 2 of them were side corner rooms which were nowhere near the deluxe rooms as shown on the website. The plumbing and the lighting too wasn't in order. On asking for a room change, the manager on duty just told that this is all that is available. With absolutely no remorse on settling us for subpar rooms. This is surely not how a 5 star property treats its guests. Thank god I stayed just 1 night.

"The Problem with Hotels on the East coast, is that they are close to the main road. Less than 20 meters. This means you cannot get away from the noise of the buses and hooting that is so prevelant in the country. Heritance is more than 200 m away from the road and therefore away from the hussel and bussel of the surrounding area. You acutally feel like you are in a quiet tropical location. You hear the birds and natural noises. The Hotel itself is stunning, Geoff Bawa, the architect definately got the right balance between building and embracing nature. The nutaral colours the blending of building with nauture is appreciated. The beaches are clean and there is a lot of beach to cover so you do not feel onto of other tourists there. The waves were fun and water temp pefrect. The only blemish is the constant harrassment of locals trying to sell you clothing or go to their resturants. The staff are excellent and well trained. They did a lot for us in terms of assisting with our wedding and went further than requested in seeing that our wedding was as beautiful and romantic as dreamed. Thank you. It also helped that the level of English was good, so communication was not a problem. Heritance can handle all element s of arranging a wedding so there was no need for a wedding planner. They even have celebrety cheif, so meals were of high standard. . Prior to coming to Heritance we were originally in Hikaduwa, which was not that great. We are not surfer, lonely planet travellers, which I felt Hikaduwa was catering for. We are in our mid thirties with our priorities at (quiet, cleanliness, beauty and a level of comfort a lady expects at this age). The prices in Hikaduwa for Hotels was not in proportion to what you were getting. Heritance was more expensive but you got what you paid for and the website is not misleading in terms of quality of rooms and the look of the hotel. We found a number of hotels in Hikaduwa misleading on their websites. Therefore Heritance was our saviour! We also recommend Heritance for a family holiday. As a kid I would of had blast swimming in the sea and swimming in both pools, one of which has a beautiful tree covering it. Lots of activities in the hotel and surrounding area. We have been to Sri Lanka three times and if I was to go back, I would only go back to Heritance to the calm and beauty of the place. Use Heritence web site to book. You get the best prices there.

"We stayed for 10 in the luxury room during February. The room itself was large and clean, however the accommodation in general needs to up its game to 5 star standards. We were shown two of the newly refitted rooms which were beautiful, however planned works due to start in May have been delayed. What a shame! Other areas of the hotel are showing signs of wear and tear for example the gym with its old equipment. Now to the positives of which there were many. The layout of the hotel is stunning with two massive pools at either end of the hotel. The staff at the hotel are outstanding with particular reference to the pool boys and resaurant staff. Nothing was ever a problem and each request was greeted with a smile . I would advise to eat at the hotel as there aren't that many options outside. Although buffet fare there was always lots of variety, and we were pleased We had a couple of issues , however these were sorted out by the general manager. If you are not happy speak with him and the issue will be resolved.

"The Triton has been renovated and relaunched at the Heritance Ahungalla (May 2006). Under the management of Aitken Spence, a major Sri Lanken hotel group, they have attempted to move away from their previous 'all inclusive' package approach to become 'Sri Lanka's first 6 star hotel'. To be honest, they have a long way to go to achieve this level. We visited in June, very shortly after they reopened. In fact, building work wasn't completed and the new Spa will not be on line for 6 months or more. It is a bit hard to know how to be fair to this hotel. They've done a great job renovating the public areas of the hotel. Although only one bar & the coffee shop were open when we were there they were very attractive, with attentive service and good (but not outstanding) food. There was also a small libary, well stocked with books for beach reading. However the biggest drawback is the size of the bedrooms. In comparison to other Sri Lankan top end hotels - such as the Galle Lighthouse Hotel or Dambulla Kandalama - the rooms and bathrooms (no bath provided) are very small. Although nicely decorated they lack a feeling of space and light. Plus the layout of the hotel means that many rooms look (indirectly) into other rooms. Staff vary from excellent (thoughtful and friendly) to down right annoying in their continual expectation of tips. The better staff including the restaurant staff were good, but lifeguards and one room boy were very pushy. Plus the internet access is ridiculously expensive ($US15 hour - over 4 times higher than anywhere else we stayed). The beach is long and undeveloped. The two pools are spacious, with plenty of deckchairs (however there were only 15 - 30 people there at the time). All in all a reasonalbly good hotel, but they have some way to go to meet the standards they have set for themselves.

"One of four Heritance hotels we stayed in during a ten day tour. Large and has good architecture and enviable position on the beach this Hotel does lack the attention to detail that others had. No welcome drinks or towels which though not a deal breaker was noticeable because when we mentioned it the promised drinks later did not appear. The dining room was large but you were left to find out for yourself that half the breakfast buffet was in the quieter other room. Beach beds were placed by someone who seemed to feel the tired faded towels were far too precious to distribute. We had a good time but did not feel the staff overall were well motivated.We would return again to any of the others ie Kandalama, Earls Regency, and theTea Factory but would probably give this one a miss next time. Amazingly the A la Carte restaurant was not able to secure many or any takers on Valentines evening.

Whilst not the most demanding of customers we were made to feel like nothing was a bother to them. Attention to detail and care was taken by the staff. Special thanks to Dumindha who represented his hotel very well. Recommended. Note However this is not a hotel if you want to swim in the sea. Currents are incredibly strong and dangerous. Now for some points to improve: The hotel is looking tired and needs a modicum of renovation. The walkway floors and hallways can get very slippery when the rain comes in.

"We had a great stay at Heritance Ahungalla this January! The hotel provides excellent quality for its price, everything is clean and comfortable. The staff was very nice everywhere, from the reception to the restaurant, and always responsive to our needs (special thanks to our housekeeper Rukmal, who made our stay even more comfortable:)). There is great food for every taste at the restaurant, if you’re curious about traditional food — it’s going to be heaven for you! There are always multiple types of curries, kottus and biriyanis, that vary every day. If you want something more familiar in food you will be satisfied too! We really miss having fresh sweet fruits with every meal. There are two pools at the hotel, one is very big and popular among kids, and the other one is smaller but way quieter and just heavenly. The nature at the hotel territory is very pleasant for the eye. There are some cute little animal visitors on the territory, but no scary big reptiles or insects (you need to be cautious of mosquitoes tho). There is live music in the lobby every night and one of the evenings we were surprised with a beautiful cultural show. On our first day we met a great tour guide whose name is Nimal, we bought an excursion from him to go to the old town of Galle and were very satisfied! We’ve had a great day, Nimal brought us to various great places and recommended a nice restaurant, we’ve taken our time and explored all these places and the old town itself. We definitely recommend Nimal’s tours! He is a great man that you can trust and always ask for a ride. I hope your stay goes as pleasant as ours!

We stayed here for 4 nights following a tour of the national parks of Sri Lanka. The hotel was of a good standard and the food in the restaurants was excellent.

"We booked our holiday in aid of 2 special events, our wedding anniversary and our friends wanted to renew their vows celebrating 25 years of marriage. In the run up to the holiday we contacted their Guest Relations Executive a Shanika Jayasekara who really was fantastic. Shanika went above and beyond to make sure both events were very special, we had room upgrades and these were right by the green pool which was our preferred room location, our rooms were made available for an early check in and this was quick and hassle free with a welcoming drink and cold face towels. On the day of our anniversary we were made to feel very special and given a cake in the evening and our table was decorated beautifully with flowers. As a surprise for our friends renewing their vows we had arranged for their grown up children to fly out for the ceremony and to join us for the rest of the holiday, Shanika was able to allocate them a room next to ours and help hide them until the ceremony. The vow renewal was a very special event indeed with drummers, dancers and an elephant, the way the hotel and especially Shanika organise these events is perfect, they really do think of everything which means we were able to just sit back and enjoy every minute of their special day. The package price was very reasonable and included a 5 course meal on the beach in the evening, with a cake. The hotel itself has the friendliest staff who really want to ensure you have a fantastic time, we are still here at the moment but felt we had to write a review sooner rather than later to let everyone know what a fantastic hotel this is. The food is very good and always something to choose to meet our tastes and if not the chef will happily cook something especially for you, we chose to eat outside in the garden area which was quieter than the main restaurant and lit beautifully with lanterns. The pool attendants made sure we had 7 sunbeds in the gardens right between our rooms and the green pool which was beautifully quiet with rarely more than 5 people in it at any one time. The beach sellers are not pushy if you are firm with them, we were able to relax on the beach without much disturbance.

Arrived at the Heritance Ahungalla at 2.00am in the morning after a 10.5 hour flight from Gatwick and a 2 hour coach transfer from airport. Absolutely tired out. We had booked 2 double rooms and 2 single rooms through Thomson's I had had problems regarding the wrong names in the wrong rooms and couldn't get it sorted through their call centre. When we went to check in they had only three rooms with a little bit of stern talk they sorted it. I believe the problem lies with Thomson's Their airport Rep was with us but did absolutely nothing to help. After that the Holiday was superb. The Hotel has the most friendly of staff Especially Himasha. The Buffet food is excellent with a vast variety of cuisines from English through Italian to Chinese and Asian. One tip! every one advises not to swim in the sea. as there are strong under currents safe enough to paddle but even then you can feel the under current drawing you out. However the 2 Hotel pools are beautiful and so swimming is no problem.

"Our initial impression was that the hotel was ok but in need of some TLC but to be fair the rooms were kept clean and the general atmosphere made for a very pleasant holiday. General points you may like to note: - the Sri Lankan people are genuinely very friendly which to begin with can confuse westerners. - the beach sales people aren’t actually that troublesome (nor are the dogs) - both pools are lovely though the green pool has far fewer kids - we never had any difficulty actually getting sun beds, though not always were we wanted them and there was a shortage of umbrellas - Food flavours lovely though we personally found the meats tough on occasion. Truthfully food does get a bit same’y after 14 nights. Wine in our first week on the all inclusive package was ropey but seemed to be changed halfway though. People said there had been complaints. - There are 2 complimentary bottles of water in room each day and it is in plentiful supply. - there is 1 “British” electric socket in the room but the rest require an adapter. Wall mounted hair drier ok but nothing special. - mosquitoes are a nightmare - take loads of spray. If you are on a TUI all inclusive it maybe helpful to know: - wine is only included with lunch and dinner. Cocktails are ok but not great. Ask for bottled tonic. - you can eat in the other restaurants at additional cost but with a 15% discount. - some tours (e.g Kandy by train and whale watching) start at 4 or 4.30 in the morning! Which wasn’t pointed out when we booked it. We didn’t get back from Kandy until 9.45pm so a very long (if great) day. We’d also recommend the Madu Nature Tour. 1/2 day with a turtle release at the end - joyous! - upgrade flights if you get the chance. It’s about £250 per flight per person but is worth it in our opinion from the airport lounge to the slightly larger seats it adds to the holiday.

"Nothing five star about this hotel. That doesn’t mean it’s terrible, it just doesn’t do what it says on the tin. We should’ve realised when we saw the deal we got. However, blissfully unaware we departed for what was meant to be a 5* hotel in Sri Lanka. From the start things went wrong. I didn’t understand how a hotel with 5* reviews on Tripadvisor could be so different to reality. But, what they do is they hand out cards asking you to rate them 5*, i presume most oblige as if you don’t they repeatedly ask you and get a “bit” irritated if you don’t. Unpleasant and unnecessary and not something you would ever experience in a 5* resort. Room: Our first room smelled like an ash tray, for two non smokers this was just an immediate no. After we said we wanted a new room they looked frustrated, but acknowledge the smell. Seemingly they wanted us to just ‘get on with it’. I don’t know if a 5* hotel which permits smoking indoors, especially with private terraces available. Finally we moved rooms (having to unpack / repack). Our second room had a broken AC, which in 32 degree heat was also unacceptable. After two nights of no sleep, 5 complaints about the AC and being told “it’s fine”, we finally moved to a third room. The AC worked and the room was much larger, an upgrade we thought. However, after the first night it was all clear. We were next to the maintenance and cleaning room, so at about 6.30-7am every morning we were woken up by the sound of trolly wheels on the stone floor. It is so loud that you don’t stand a chance of sleeping through. Initially they don’t turn down the bed and don’t give you the water they promise. The upside of the rooms are the large and comfy beds, and our room housekeeper (Rukhal) was good and left funny towel shapes (monkeys, dogs etc). Poolside: the pools are great, we spent most of our days by the green pool. Lots of space and a nice atmosphere. However, they don’t clear up so following morning you will find yesterdays banana skins, glasses etc. Quite disgusting. We ended up clearing up ourselves. Staff: some great members of staff, highlight was definitely Waruna. Seemingly the only trained and wanting to please member of staff. The rest don’t want to be there and expect to be greated with eye rolls and attitude even when ordering food. You feel like you’ve inconvenienced them at great length. Try ordering a cappuccino at breakfast and you’ll know what I mean. Especially when you get a cold one and ask for a hot one. Three people will try to tell you to drink it and then dip a finger in when you say it’s cold. Going the extra mile certainly doesn’t come naturally. Another upside was when the guest relations manager walked around asking for feedback. We shared our experience and things improved, that evening our bed was turned down, more water was given and pool was improved. It lasted merely one day though. Also, one member of staff in the restaurant wears an unsightly net vest! I think he is trying to be funny. Seems unhygienic and out of place. The hotel is filled with staff but they are untrained and only do one job e.g open door, fill water (no other beverage) so you end up waiting a long time. They also take your food away from you before you have finished and give you bill before you are ready. Stressful, to say the least. Food: the local food is great, especially the Dahl. Lots of food available and we can’t complain. Not 5* but still very good. Facilities: they claim to have several bars and restaurant but there aren’t, or at least not in use. They also have mould in several areas, cracks and paint chipping. The toilets don’t have soap and are often untidy. Spa: fab! Loved it and worth a visit. Entertainment: avoid! Hotel should stick to the live music. The shows and plays ruin what would be a romantic evening with your other half. Overall: despite all this, we had a great holiday, but that was down to my husband and I laughing about it all and making the most of it. I would even recommend this place to others, but with the caveat - you get what you pay for. It’s a firm 3*. WiFi is also fab! Tip: visit some of the local restaurants on the beach! Great food. Also, stay away from ocean - strong currents and big waves. Can be very dangerous and if red flag is up your insurance won’t cover any accidents. Don’t forget to check your bill, they say 50% off but don’t give it to you unless you remind them. Expect an eye roll and potentially an argument before it happens.",negative,nothing five star about this hotel that doesnt mean it terrible it just doesnt do what it say on the tin we shouldve realised when we saw the deal we got however blissfully unaware we departed for what wa meant to be a hotel in sri lanka from the start thing went wrong i didnt understand how a hotel with review on tripadvisor could be so different to reality but what they do is they hand out card asking you to rate them i presume most oblige a if you dont they repeatedly ask you and get a bit irritated if you dont unpleasant and unnecessary and not something you would ever experience in a resort room our first room smelled like an ash tray for two non smoker this wa just an immediate no after we said we wanted a new room they looked frustrated but acknowledge the smell seemingly they wanted u to just get on with it i dont know if a hotel which permit smoking indoors especially with private terrace available finally we moved room having to unpack repack our second room had a broken ac which in degree heat wa also unacceptable after two night of no sleep complaint about the ac and being told it fine we finally moved to a third room the ac worked and the room wa much larger an upgrade we thought however after the first night it wa all clear we were next to the maintenance and cleaning room so at about am every morning we were woken up by the sound of trolly wheel on the stone floor it is so loud that you dont stand a chance of sleeping through initially they dont turn down the bed and dont give you the water they promise the upside of the room are the large and comfy bed and our room housekeeper rukhal wa good and left funny towel shape monkey dog etc poolside the pool are great we spent most of our day by the green pool lot of space and a nice atmosphere however they dont clear up so following morning you will find yesterday banana skin glass etc quite disgusting we ended up clearing up ourselves staff some great member of staff highlight wa definitely waruna seemingly the only trained and wanting to please member of staff the rest dont want to be there and expect to be greated with eye roll and attitude even when ordering food you feel like youve inconvenienced them at great length try ordering a cappuccino at breakfast and youll know what i mean especially when you get a cold one and ask for a hot one three people will try to tell you to drink it and then dip a finger in when you say it cold going the extra mile certainly doesnt come naturally another upside wa when the guest relation manager walked around asking for feedback we shared our experience and thing improved that evening our bed wa turned down more water wa given and pool wa improved it lasted merely one day though also one member of staff in the restaurant wear an unsightly net vest i think he is trying to be funny seems unhygienic and out of place the hotel is filled with staff but they are untrained and only do one job eg open door fill water no other beverage so you end up waiting a long time they also take your food away from you before you have finished and give you bill before you are ready stressful to say the least food the local food is great especially the dahl lot of food available and we cant complain not but still very good facility they claim to have several bar and restaurant but there arent or at least not in use they also have mould in several area crack and paint chipping the toilet dont have soap and are often untidy spa fab loved it and worth a visit entertainment avoid hotel should stick to the live music the show and play ruin what would be a romantic evening with your other half overall despite all this we had a great holiday but that wa down to my husband and i laughing about it all and making the most of it i would even recommend this place to others but with the caveat you get what you pay for it a firm wifi is also fab tip visit some of the local restaurant on the beach great food also stay away from ocean strong current and big wave can be very dangerous and if red flag is up your insurance wont cover any accident dont forget to check your bill they say off but dont give it to you unless you remind them expect an eye roll and potentially an argument before it happens,4480,825,4.431515151515152,0,0.998,0.15,0.069,0.781,0.06039405964405964,0.5203838383838384

"My wife and I stayed here for three weeks and overall found it to be a comfortable and very friendly hotel. This is branded as a five star hotel, but in our experience, these star ratings are pretty meaningless and we have found that nearly everywhere we have been in the world. If you are influenced by star ratings you may be disappointed for reasons I will explain later. The public areas are expansive and the hotel looks out over a lovely beach area. The red warning flag flew every day of our stay and you would do well to take notice of this because there are strong undercurrents. But we swam nearly every day in the hotel pools both of which are large and set in the attractive hotel grounds. Our room was on the 3rd floor and a good size with all the usual fittings including tv with mostly English channels, very effective shower, balcony overlooking hotel gardens, hair dryer and a safe. One day a room attendant arrived to change the safe and after emptying, picked it up and put it on his trolley. Not so safe then! There is a well equipped gymn on the 2nd floor and there is good Wi-Fi throughout the hotel and even in the grounds it isn’t too bad. Here I have to mention what many visitors will regard as the main criticism of the hotel. The rooms are a bit dated and well used. By that I mean they do look a bit tired and in need of refurbishment. Having said that, I don't think people should be put off by this because there are many really good aspects to this property. For example, we stayed on an all inclusive basis and the food in the main restaurant is outstanding. Every day there are at least seven or eight choices of main course. If that's not enough Chef Manjula who walks the restaurant floor during service, will cook something to your liking. Most of the cuisine is curry orientated but you can get plain fish or meat. He cooked a very tasty sirloin for me. Coupled with the friendly service, and the delightful staff, this really is the main selling point of the hotel. It is worth noting if you are all inclusive that you can only get wine (it's Italian) in the main restaurant and not from the bars. This was a bit irritating for us since we are wine drinkers and didn't want to drink beer, shorts or cocktails they serve in the bar areas. The other point to be aware of is that for religious reasons, if it is a full moon the law forbids the sale of any alcoholic drink for the whole day. There are quite severe penalties if any establishment is found selling or distributing alcohol. We also got caught out on Independence day and regional election day both of which were no alcohol days. The hotel has two fine dining restaurants and a seafood shack called the Wadiyah. We tried this and had fresh grilled fish right by the beach. In our opinion, it is not particularly fine dining. The table mats were dirty, only bar stools were provided until we asked for proper chairs, the music stopped and was never restarted, the salad was very small and the area is poorly lit. It lacked any real atmosphere. You have to pay for any of the alternative dining and we paid 15000 Sri Lankan rupees which is about £75 including wine. We also dined in the Upper Room where mostly European food is served and had New Zealand lamb which was very good. In our opinion this is a good hotel with excellent food in the main restaurant and wonderful friendly staff. They really do go the extra mile to make your stay a happy one. This all goes a long way towards overcoming the increasingly pressing need for refurbishment of the bedrooms.",neutral,my wife and i stayed here for three week and overall found it to be a comfortable and very friendly hotel this is branded a a five star hotel but in our experience these star rating are pretty meaningless and we have found that nearly everywhere we have been in the world if you are influenced by star rating you may be disappointed for reason i will explain later the public area are expansive and the hotel look out over a lovely beach area the red warning flag flew every day of our stay and you would do well to take notice of this because there are strong undercurrent but we swam nearly every day in the hotel pool both of which are large and set in the attractive hotel ground our room wa on the rd floor and a good size with all the usual fitting including tv with mostly english channel very effective shower balcony overlooking hotel garden hair dryer and a safe one day a room attendant arrived to change the safe and after emptying picked it up and put it on his trolley not so safe then there is a well equipped gymn on the nd floor and there is good wifi throughout the hotel and even in the ground it isnt too bad here i have to mention what many visitor will regard a the main criticism of the hotel the room are a bit dated and well used by that i mean they do look a bit tired and in need of refurbishment having said that i dont think people should be put off by this because there are many really good aspect to this property for example we stayed on an all inclusive basis and the food in the main restaurant is outstanding every day there are at least seven or eight choice of main course if thats not enough chef manjula who walk the restaurant floor during service will cook something to your liking most of the cuisine is curry orientated but you can get plain fish or meat he cooked a very tasty sirloin for me coupled with the friendly service and the delightful staff this really is the main selling point of the hotel it is worth noting if you are all inclusive that you can only get wine it italian in the main restaurant and not from the bar this wa a bit irritating for u since we are wine drinker and didnt want to drink beer short or cocktail they serve in the bar area the other point to be aware of is that for religious reason if it is a full moon the law forbids the sale of any alcoholic drink for the whole day there are quite severe penalty if any establishment is found selling or distributing alcohol we also got caught out on independence day and regional election day both of which were no alcohol day the hotel ha two fine dining restaurant and a seafood shack called the wadiyah we tried this and had fresh grilled fish right by the beach in our opinion it is not particularly fine dining the table mat were dirty only bar stool were provided until we asked for proper chair the music stopped and wa never restarted the salad wa very small and the area is poorly lit it lacked any real atmosphere you have to pay for any of the alternative dining and we paid sri lankan rupee which is about including wine we also dined in the upper room where mostly european food is served and had new zealand lamb which wa very good in our opinion this is a good hotel with excellent food in the main restaurant and wonderful friendly staff they really do go the extra mile to make your stay a happy one this all go a long way towards overcoming the increasingly pressing need for refurbishment of the bedroom,3559,660,4.393939393939394,3,0.996,0.139,0.07,0.791,0.18232588087018464,0.483925831552414
"We stayed at the hotel for 2 nights during the 2nd week of August. Took the new Southern Express Tollway to get there and was amazed at how the relaxing the dirve was compared to the Galle Road which we have driven through in the past which used to be a trying experience. The GRO greeted us and offered us a choice for the welcome drink (Watermelon, Orange and coconut water) and also a refreshing cold wet towel which was most welcome as the humidity was pretty high that day. The hotel pool which can be seen from the time you get off the car is absolutley fantastic and overlooks the ocean. We were upgraded to higher level room which gave us a pool view as well as a partial sea view. The lighting in the room was decorative and as I've always noticed in most hotel globally too dim during the night. Why the designers of hotels allover think that mood lighting has to be dim I will never fathom. The food (we were on HB basis) in the retaurant was fabulous and they had a western as well as Sri Lankan choice. We had lunch on 2 days from the speciality restaurant on a la carte and that too was excellent. The choice of wines is limited as expected in a 3-4 star hotel of that standard. The beach was quite nice although the sea was quite choppy on both days due the season we were told. The hotel has limited activities compared to a 5 star hotel in the city but this is to be expected as one goes to these type of resort hotels only to enjoy the beach and pool. The hotel does have a 2nd pool but we did not use it as it was 1.7m depth all round and was too deep for my 2 kids and also had a lot of leaves fallen in du to the close proximity of large trees along the pool. The service was quite good but could also be attributed to the fact that we were staying during the week where the occupancy is lower than compared to the weekends.",positive,we stayed at the hotel for night during the nd week of august took the new southern express tollway to get there and wa amazed at how the relaxing the dirve wa compared to the galle road which we have driven through in the past which used to be a trying experience the gro greeted u and offered u a choice for the welcome drink watermelon orange and coconut water and also a refreshing cold wet towel which wa most welcome a the humidity wa pretty high that day the hotel pool which can be seen from the time you get off the car is absolutley fantastic and overlook the ocean we were upgraded to higher level room which gave u a pool view a well a a partial sea view the lighting in the room wa decorative and a ive always noticed in most hotel globally too dim during the night why the designer of hotel allover think that mood lighting ha to be dim i will never fathom the food we were on hb basis in the retaurant wa fabulous and they had a western a well a sri lankan choice we had lunch on day from the speciality restaurant on a la carte and that too wa excellent the choice of wine is limited a expected in a star hotel of that standard the beach wa quite nice although the sea wa quite choppy on both day due the season we were told the hotel ha limited activity compared to a star hotel in the city but this is to be expected a one go to these type of resort hotel only to enjoy the beach and pool the hotel doe have a nd pool but we did not use it a it wa m depth all round and wa too deep for my kid and also had a lot of leaf fallen in du to the close proximity of large tree along the pool the service wa quite good but could also be attributed to the fact that we were staying during the week where the occupancy is lower than compared to the weekend,1845,363,4.085399449035813,3,0.9619,0.084,0.023,0.893,0.1592646542646543,0.4901035451035451
"We stayed her for 11 nights at the end of September to celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary and this was our third stay here. We were married here (when it was Triton) in 2000. The staff are extremely friendly and really do want to make sure every aspect of your stay is perfect. I’ve read some of the reviews about the food which seem overly critical but there is something for everyone. There are chefs on duty during breakfast, lunch and dinner and if you can’t find something to suit your palate from the varied selection on offer – just ask they would be more than happy to make arrangements for you. We were very well looked after from the moment we arrived. We had made a specific room request which was met and we weren’t disappointed. We had a suite overlooking the Green (residents) pool which in our opinion is the quieter end of the hotel and this was important to us. The room was extremely comfortable, very clean and maintained twice a day (including turn down service) so fresh towels, water and anything you need is never too far away. I love the creations that the room staff make of towels and fresh flowers. During our stay we received a complimentary dinner in the fine dining restaurant. The chef on duty was TSM deSilva and it was an incredible culinary experience. All aspects of the meal were well flavoured and presented with such care. It was obvious to us that Chef de Silva has a passion for creating amazing flavours and he was keen to receive feedback on the dishes he creates and he chatted with us to make sure we were happy with all aspects of the fine dining experience. We enjoyed it so much we went back again during our stay and we weren’t disappointed. The second meal was as incredible as the first. They have a lot of talented staff here at Heritance and together they make a great team. We were lucky enough to be given a tour of the kitchens and the Chocolate factory which was absolutely mind boggling. The creations they create have to be seen to be believed. Keep up the good work and please don’t change too much of what makes this hotel a special place when you close for your next refurbishment (which we understand is due in 2016). The one thing I would say is if you are planning to stay here, all-inclusive does not include please and thank you to the staff. I was astonished at the attitude of some guests towards the staff – as I’ve already mentioned the staff want to make your stay the best it can be – saying please and thank to the staff does not cost you anything so remember to take your manners with you. Thank you to all the staff who looked after us so well.

"This place has deteriorated unbelievably. I have visited the hotel on multiple occasions. In the early 2012s the Hotel was decent with friendly staff. Now its all gone down sour. I revisited again in 2016 but was shocked to find out that the standards have turned so bad. Firstly, I was welcomed by the usual friendly smiles and what not but the staff at the pool were extremely rude, and racist... I took some family visiting from the middle east for lunch and soon found that the hotel service made them very upset. They tried to use the pool, however soon knocked back and told that 3 quarter shorts weren't suitable for pool. These idiots have no idea. As a traveller in many western countries, I have never seen such fools running a hotel.. They don't know what guest services means... then the racism part kicks in where the staff are plain rude and are like robots and smiles at white skin guests, but frowns upon anyone with a tinge more of colour...

"They say first impressions are everything!! We knew we were in for a rough time as soon as we arrived. On arrival we were shown to a scruffy bar area with tatty leatherette seats which were all torn and ripped. For the third time in 6 days in Sri Lanka we were taken to a really horrid room (No. 228)!! OMG what a dump - we had paid for a king-size luxury room and what we got was a prison cell twin!! It was filthy, pokey, run down and utterly horrid. Needless to say we made a fuss and were initially told we would have to pay for an upgrade!! We were finally upgraded to a suite gratis. Unfortunately this was not much better!! The hotel is in a terrible state and is in dire need of major renovation. One of the biggest problems in this hotel is the design. This hotel is celebrated for it's design and architecture but in my opinion this is misplaced. All the bathroom walls are simply skimmed concrete which gives them a horrid dingy, dirty prison cell-like appearance. There were no curtains - just these filthy heavy shutters which moved in filthy tracks. The blinds were broken, filthy and flaking!! Pillows were stained. The remote control for the TV was held together with sticky tape, the hotel guide book was covered in sticky dried food, the chair at the desk was filthy and the mini-bar fridge was rusty and leaking water. The final straw was the insect life living in the room!! We were tired, upset and ready to leave. By this time it was very late at night and we contacted our travel agents in UK and told them we wanted to return to UK asap. We were told there was nothing that could be done until the morning. We spent a very uncomfortable night and waited to see what would happen. Well; we had obviously stirred the hornets nest!! Next morning we were contacted by the front of house manager and within minutes we were surrounded by loads of staff members apologising and promising to make things right. After a short while we were upgraded again to a genuinely luxury suite which was lovely. Clean linen, clean floors, curtains and the biggest jacuzzi I have ever seen!! Throughout the whole process all of the staff at the hotel were wonderful and helpful and charming!! We enjoyed the rest of our stay. Once this hotel has been renovated it will be fantastic, if you are looking for a stunning beach resort. The location is idyllic. The buffet restaurant is good with plenty of high quality options - western and local cuisine. Make the most of the area - hire the bikes that the hotel offer and enjoy the amazing countryside. - we spent a couple of hours cycling through the local village. What a treat!! Giant Monitor lizard by the side of the road, buffalo wandering towards us on the road, local farmers working in the paddy fields surrounded by cattle Egrets and monkeys jumping through the trees!! It was very hot but one of the highlights of our trip. A day trip to Galle was very worthwhile as were trips to the local towns. The local Turtle hatcheries are wonderful but beware the 'Spice Gardens' - rip-offs aimed squarely at parting unwary tourists from their cash!! I was genuinely shocked at the number of people putting their towels on the pool-side loungers before breakfast and then obviously spending the whole day baking and drinking beer. Bloody long way to go for skin cancer and to not experience all the amazing sights, people and wildlife this wonderful country has to offer!!",negative,they say first impression are everything we knew we were in for a rough time a soon a we arrived on arrival we were shown to a scruffy bar area with tatty leatherette seat which were all torn and ripped for the third time in day in sri lanka we were taken to a really horrid room no omg what a dump we had paid for a kingsize luxury room and what we got wa a prison cell twin it wa filthy pokey run down and utterly horrid needless to say we made a fuss and were initially told we would have to pay for an upgrade we were finally upgraded to a suite gratis unfortunately this wa not much better the hotel is in a terrible state and is in dire need of major renovation one of the biggest problem in this hotel is the design this hotel is celebrated for it design and architecture but in my opinion this is misplaced all the bathroom wall are simply skimmed concrete which give them a horrid dingy dirty prison celllike appearance there were no curtain just these filthy heavy shutter which moved in filthy track the blind were broken filthy and flaking pillow were stained the remote control for the tv wa held together with sticky tape the hotel guide book wa covered in sticky dried food the chair at the desk wa filthy and the minibar fridge wa rusty and leaking water the final straw wa the insect life living in the room we were tired upset and ready to leave by this time it wa very late at night and we contacted our travel agent in uk and told them we wanted to return to uk asap we were told there wa nothing that could be done until the morning we spent a very uncomfortable night and waited to see what would happen well we had obviously stirred the hornet nest next morning we were contacted by the front of house manager and within minute we were surrounded by load of staff member apologising and promising to make thing right after a short while we were upgraded again to a genuinely luxury suite which wa lovely clean linen clean floor curtain and the biggest jacuzzi i have ever seen throughout the whole process all of the staff at the hotel were wonderful and helpful and charming we enjoyed the rest of our stay once this hotel ha been renovated it will be fantastic if you are looking for a stunning beach resort the location is idyllic the buffet restaurant is good with plenty of high quality option western and local cuisine make the most of the area hire the bike that the hotel offer and enjoy the amazing countryside we spent a couple of hour cycling through the local village what a treat giant monitor lizard by the side of the road buffalo wandering towards u on the road local farmer working in the paddy field surrounded by cattle egret and monkey jumping through the tree it wa very hot but one of the highlight of our trip a day trip to galle wa very worthwhile a were trip to the local town the local turtle hatchery are wonderful but beware the spice garden ripoffs aimed squarely at parting unwary tourist from their cash i wa genuinely shocked at the number of people putting their towel on the poolside lounger before breakfast and then obviously spending the whole day baking and drinking beer bloody long way to go for skin cancer and to not experience all the amazing sight people and wildlife this wonderful country ha to offer,3424,618,4.542071197411003,3,0.9892,0.129,0.09,0.781,0.02768342695059245,0.5857053431701317

Stayed here with my wife after a week in a hotel in the north of Sri Lanka. The food in the buffet was extremely poor. The al carte was very expensive which would of been ok if the food was good but it was terrible. We had bolognese one day and the spaghetti had been cut up in to tinny pieces or they had served us the crumbs at the bottom of the packet. Second time we ate there the lasagna was also terrible. It had been reheated so much that that the pasta literally could not be cut let alone eaten. When we complained it took nearly half hr and a six man conference In the kitchen to come to the conclusion that it was not edible. We then decided to try the fine dinning restaurant only to find out it was the same chef from the al carte restaurant ! We ate in local restaurants from then on which were really nice and a fraction of the price. Finally upon checking out we were charged for basically the entire mini bar ! After disputing this are bill was quite quickly adjusted to what we had actually taken from the mini bar. In conclusion the hotel is drab over priced and you are extorted at ever opportunity ! My advise would be to keep well away,negative,stayed here with my wife after a week in a hotel in the north of sri lanka the food in the buffet wa extremely poor the al carte wa very expensive which would of been ok if the food wa good but it wa terrible we had bolognese one day and the spaghetti had been cut up in to tinny piece or they had served u the crumb at the bottom of the packet second time we ate there the lasagna wa also terrible it had been reheated so much that that the pasta literally could not be cut let alone eaten when we complained it took nearly half hr and a six man conference in the kitchen to come to the conclusion that it wa not edible we then decided to try the fine dinning restaurant only to find out it wa the same chef from the al carte restaurant we ate in local restaurant from then on which were really nice and a fraction of the price finally upon checking out we were charged for basically the entire mini bar after disputing this are bill wa quite quickly adjusted to what we had actually taken from the mini bar in conclusion the hotel is drab over priced and you are extorted at ever opportunity my advise would be to keep well away,1157,227,4.101321585903084,0,-0.8542,0.072,0.101,0.827,-0.040350877192982464,0.5277192982456139

"Ok so after arriving from a long 11/12 Hour flight from UK the 3 hour transfer to the hotel was not an experience I was looking forward to the traffic was very bad and seemed to take a life time. We had our own private car transfer and I would advise anyone staying to do the same to make the journey more bareable. Upon arrival it was evident the journey had been well worth it the architecture and landscape is truely breath taking. We recieved a warm friendly welcome and was wisked off to the bar for a welcome drink while our luggage was taken to our room. We were shown to our room and the staff member talked us through how to use the air con and the facilities available. As soon as the staff member left my partner and I burst out laughing as we couldn't believe how lucky we were. The room was amazing with stunning Ocean views and the main infinity pool from our balcony. The room is finished to a very high standard, immaculatley clean. Well stocked mini bar (not complimentary), fridge, air con and cieling fan, safe, plenty of storage for clothes, TV, Phone, complimentary water (replenished daily) and a welcome cake. The bathroom had ample towels which were changed twice daily (bare this in mind if you like us to have a nap in the early eve before dinner to put you do not disturb sign on the door so they dont disturb you while your sleeping) complimentary toiletries -shampoo, shower gel and body lotion. Our room had a huge rain shower (room for 2 or even 3 people hehe) I noted there was also a hair dryer but can't say either of us used it. Food-Breakfast was the biggest breakfast buffet I have ever seen it was nice to be able to to sample a Sri Lankan breakfast but no fear if thats not your thing there is much more a wide range of breads, cakes and pasteries, cold meats, cheese, salad, everything for a cooked English breakfast and chefs cooking omelettes, waffles, pancakes and fresh fruit/juice theatre style. (we never felt the need to eat lunch after that lot) We ate dinner in the Mustard Coffee shop on the first night the Lobster was very nice! We had dinner in the main Jute retaurant restaurant for the rest of our stay which was a set menu most evenings about 7 courses, canape, 3 starters usually small bite size of each (served at same time) 2 soups (small cups served at same time) a sorbet then you had a choice of mains which was usually a meat dish a fish/seafood dish and vegetarian option you then had a choice of desserts followed by fresh Ceylon tea or coffee they also had 2 BBQ themed evenings during our stay spoilt for choice for meats and fresh seafoods salads and desserts other hot non BBQ dishes were also available on the buffet such as currys and pasta dishes the cost was 2500 rupees (per person for both the set dinner and BBQ roughly £13) which we thought was really good value. The food was always excecuted and presented extremley well although maybe one or two too many components on a plate at the same time (but this is probably my chefy foodie head on) each component tasted great and thats what matters. Drinks- we stuck to drinking the local 'lion' beer for most of our trip (served with a glass that had been stored in the freezer to ensure its stayes nice and cold which was a nice touch) which was 320 rupees (£1.70 a pint size bottle) we was shown an extensive wine list that had lots of famliar names I think the cheapest started around £12. We drunk our way through the cocktail menu on the last night all very nice particularly their own Heritance cocktail (cant remember exact name i had hade a few by then) made with the local Arak and all the classics are also available all 800 rupees (roughly £4.50) we was treated to complimentary canapes and homemade crisps as we enjoyed our drinks service at the bar and restaurant was always great. Facilities - 2 Huge Infinity pools we was lucky the hotel was not busy the only people in them most days the pool attendents were very friendly and sufficent, i noted a tennis court, volly ball net, snooker room, games room although didn't use them so not sure if they have the equipment or you need to bring your own? There internet access in the Library on the second floor it was just over £1 for an hour you have to get a card from the reception. Theres a night club on site we popped in briefly but as the hotel was quiet we was the only people in there and wasn't quite the same raving on ya own haha. Music from the club was well contained so not fear of being woken up by music in your room. There is a Spa but was a bit to pricey for us. There is a well equiped gym that is free to guests. We took a tuk tuk (300 rupees roughly £1.60 return) down the road to the turtle hatchery 1000 rupees PP entrance donation (£5.50) we went around 3pm we was advised the best time to go is around 5/6pm you might then be able to takes some turtles back to the sea (we didnt want wait around that long) still an enjoyable experience either way. The weather was perfect (June 4th-12th 2009) cloudy most days but hot (hot enough to get a tan or burnt in my case) with a nice sea breeze the odd down pour usually in the afternoon but it stops and dry out again real quick didnt bother us at all the sea unfortunately was to rough for a propper swim but was ok for a paddle my partner also go a mild sting from a jelly fish so that put us off going in again. As other people have said in their reviews hawkers (lookie lookie men/woman) are a real hassel on the beach and surrounding area we walked to the local shop to try and buy Cigarettes (you cant bring any in duty free without paying goverment tax) and we were swamped with people trying to talk to us takes us places make us go to shops following us it was a bit overwhelming and i didn't feel particularly safe having so many people around me we didnt leave the hotel on foot again after that. Also many a quiet morning walk on the beach would be spoilt I saw one couple get surrounded by 8 people this is something the resort have no control other however they do have security guards on the beach preventing them entering so no hassel in the resort complex. So an amazing stay! Definatley want to go back.",neutral,ok so after arriving from a long hour flight from uk the hour transfer to the hotel wa not an experience i wa looking forward to the traffic wa very bad and seemed to take a life time we had our own private car transfer and i would advise anyone staying to do the same to make the journey more bareable upon arrival it wa evident the journey had been well worth it the architecture and landscape is truely breath taking we recieved a warm friendly welcome and wa wisked off to the bar for a welcome drink while our luggage wa taken to our room we were shown to our room and the staff member talked u through how to use the air con and the facility available a soon a the staff member left my partner and i burst out laughing a we couldnt believe how lucky we were the room wa amazing with stunning ocean view and the main infinity pool from our balcony the room is finished to a very high standard immaculatley clean well stocked mini bar not complimentary fridge air con and cieling fan safe plenty of storage for clothes tv phone complimentary water replenished daily and a welcome cake the bathroom had ample towel which were changed twice daily bare this in mind if you like u to have a nap in the early eve before dinner to put you do not disturb sign on the door so they dont disturb you while your sleeping complimentary toiletry shampoo shower gel and body lotion our room had a huge rain shower room for or even people hehe i noted there wa also a hair dryer but cant say either of u used it foodbreakfast wa the biggest breakfast buffet i have ever seen it wa nice to be able to to sample a sri lankan breakfast but no fear if thats not your thing there is much more a wide range of bread cake and pasteries cold meat cheese salad everything for a cooked english breakfast and chef cooking omelette waffle pancake and fresh fruitjuice theatre style we never felt the need to eat lunch after that lot we ate dinner in the mustard coffee shop on the first night the lobster wa very nice we had dinner in the main jute retaurant restaurant for the rest of our stay which wa a set menu most evening about course canape starter usually small bite size of each served at same time soup small cup served at same time a sorbet then you had a choice of main which wa usually a meat dish a fishseafood dish and vegetarian option you then had a choice of dessert followed by fresh ceylon tea or coffee they also had bbq themed evening during our stay spoilt for choice for meat and fresh seafood salad and dessert other hot non bbq dish were also available on the buffet such a curry and pasta dish the cost wa rupee per person for both the set dinner and bbq roughly which we thought wa really good value the food wa always excecuted and presented extremley well although maybe one or two too many component on a plate at the same time but this is probably my chefy foodie head on each component tasted great and thats what matter drink we stuck to drinking the local lion beer for most of our trip served with a glass that had been stored in the freezer to ensure it stayes nice and cold which wa a nice touch which wa rupee a pint size bottle we wa shown an extensive wine list that had lot of famliar name i think the cheapest started around we drunk our way through the cocktail menu on the last night all very nice particularly their

"I had a twin room which was very good but maybe would be a bit on the small size for two people. The bed was very comfortable, there was a desk with a reading lamp in the corner. The bathroom was small but fine for just me. There is a big pool very close to, and overlooking the beach and sea. The sea has too many waves to swim in but good for splashing around and having a bit of fun in. There is not much outside the property but there is a jewellery shop across the road with a very helpful and genuine owner and a wine shop to the right who will rip you off with ""tourist prices"". To get further afield the hotel does offer taxis but they are expensive. I enquired about Bentota and it was $23 return, another couple got a Tuk Tuk and ""negotiated"" the price down to 700 SLR abut £3.50. Obviously the car is more comfortable, your choice.

"Arrived late following delayed flight and driver getting lost so we weren't in the best of moods. Felt we could have been offered some food instead of relying on the mini bar but I suppose we could have asked for it. Shown to a room which had a view of a tree right outside so changed that to a much better one overlooking the pool with a sea view. Much better but why are the bathrooms left with bare plaster? Don't get that one. The good times then began because Heritance is a wonderful hotel with excellent staff in a glorious position on a beautiful beach. Felt like Robinson Crusoe whenever I walked on it with waving palms behind me and my feet in the warm Indian Ocean. Only problem are the beach kawkers who don't take no for an answer and pester you to death. The big pool is awesome and the pool attendants outstanding at providing towels and mattresses very quickly. Food is a bit hit and miss. Breakfast is really good if you go in early; not so good if you go in late and food has not been re- refreshed. The evening buffet was exceptional on barbecue night but a little bland on other nights although there was always something to attract you. Desserts are very good as are the soups. Tried the a la carte restaurant once and the lobster was really good but took an eternity to come -odd with only two of us in there but great value for money. The hotel is made for relaxing and the staff go out of their way to help guests to enjoy their stay. We only had four days and we were really sorry to leave. When the sun is out and you're on your sunbed by the pool overlooking the beach, it just doesn't get any better!

"This is the most difficult review I have written so far. The hotel has two parts – one is brilliant and another is terrible. Therefore I summed everything up and evaluated it as average. Brilliant points: Extensive, very clean beach with clean ocean water. Fantastic pool area (two pools fit for any taste) with very good service. Nice reception, pleasant and airy open lobby. Beautiful grounds with veritable zoo: variety of birds, squirrels, shy langur monkeys, almost friendly molitors, etc. Superb food both at evening and morning buffet. Terrible points: Rooms and bathrooms are outdated, dirty, smelly (sometimes smell of sewage is overwhelming) and ill-kept, some may be cockroachy. After one night I asked to change my room on the ground floor which totally awful to only slightly better on the first floor (at least with more light). Housekeeping is poor: rooms are not cleaned until very late and then, several hours later, in the evening there comes house keeping again for god knows what reason. Also in the dining area at one point the floor was slippery because of spilt fat and remained so for at least two days. Hotel spa prices are more than exorbitant, go for massage to the village. Beware when dealing in cash: bad exchange rate (and different than told at the reception) the cashier cheats (tried to swindle me and one of our group too), so count your money carefully. Even when in the hotel grounds (and especially on beach) you are periodically accosted by touts, seller of various goods, tuk tuk drivers, etc. If you leave the grounds and go to the village you are immediately swarmed with “helpers” who tussle between themselves and finally you will have one fixed “leach” who will follow all the time offering all kinds of goods and services. So, if you are indifferent to the room you sleep in, the hotel is perfectly all right, even great. But otherwise consider other possibilities.",negative,this is the most difficult review i have written so far the hotel ha two part one is brilliant and another is terrible therefore i summed everything up and evaluated it a average brilliant point extensive very clean beach with clean ocean water fantastic pool area two pool fit for any taste with very good service nice reception pleasant and airy open lobby beautiful ground with veritable zoo variety of bird squirrel shy langur monkey almost friendly molitors etc superb food both at evening and morning buffet terrible point room and bathroom are outdated dirty smelly sometimes smell of sewage is overwhelming and illkept some may be cockroachy after one night i asked to change my room on the ground floor which totally awful to only slightly better on the first floor at least with more light housekeeping is poor room are not cleaned until very late and then several hour later in the evening there come house keeping again for god know what reason also in the dining area at one point the floor wa slippery because of spilt fat and remained so for at least two day hotel spa price are more than exorbitant go for massage to the village beware when dealing in cash bad exchange rate and different than told at the reception the cashier cheat tried to swindle me and one of our group too so count your money carefully even when in the hotel ground and especially on beach you are periodically accosted by tout seller of various good tuk tuk driver etc if you leave the ground and go to the village you are immediately swarmed with helper who tussle between themselves and finally you will have one fixed leach who will follow all the time offering all kind of good and service so if you are indifferent to the room you sleep in the hotel is perfectly all right even great but otherwise consider other possibility,1911,325,4.883076923076923,2,0.904,0.104,0.066,0.83,0.12254960317460317,0.6909176587301588

"Totally disappointed with this hotel. The entrance foyer was cold and clinical which was about the standard for the whole hotel. There was no entertainment until we complained and then there was some water aerobics and that was about it. There was a games room that was filthy and had about 2 board games in it, the snooker table you had to pay for, the pool table you had to pay for. There were 3 restaurants but you only really had a choice of 2 as the Upper Dining Room was ridiculously expensive, we did not actually see anyone eat there in our 2 week stayy! There was a cafe with a very limited menu or the main restaurant that was a buffet. The food in these 2 restaurants was okay but the service was terrible. Breakfast was served in the buffet restaurant and the tables were always mucky, you had to constantly ask for tea or coffee and sometimes wait for up to 20 minutes for it to arrive. On a Saturday the hotel opens the main infinity pool area up to local customers, this meant that we had to use the other pool which upset the children. The main pool was rammed with people playing games and being extremely loud making it much to dangerous for children to swim and also a very uncomfortable environment. Whilst at the other pool we ordered lunch and were told we would have a long wait as they were so busy as it was a Saturday!! Whilst we were at the hotel the Sri Lankan and Indian national crickets teams were there, the hotels focus was totally on them and important members of staff were moved to run the catering at the matches - this was very much noticed by guests at the hotel as the service in the restaurants became ridiculously slow and many mistakes were made. The people of Sri Lanka our lovely and very kind and helpful and we felt totally safe when we wandered along the beach way from the hotel. We met a fantastic driver who was wonderful in showing us around and really looked after our children, he is a recommended driver at the hotel and his name is Erish. We had some absolutely wonderful experiences when he took us out as he really worked to make sure we saw everything and enjoyed ourselves, he is also a good driver and very safe which is quite a rarity in Sri Lanka!!!",negative,totally disappointed with this hotel the entrance foyer wa cold and clinical which wa about the standard for the whole hotel there wa no entertainment until we complained and then there wa some water aerobics and that wa about it there wa a game room that wa filthy and had about board game in it the snooker table you had to pay for the pool table you had to pay for there were restaurant but you only really had a choice of a the upper dining room wa ridiculously expensive we did not actually see anyone eat there in our week stayy there wa a cafe with a very limited menu or the main restaurant that wa a buffet the food in these restaurant wa okay but the service wa terrible breakfast wa served in the buffet restaurant and the table were always mucky you had to constantly ask for tea or coffee and sometimes wait for up to minute for it to arrive on a saturday the hotel open the main infinity pool area up to local customer this meant that we had to use the other pool which upset the child the main pool wa rammed with people playing game and being extremely loud making it much to dangerous for child to swim and also a very uncomfortable environment whilst at the other pool we ordered lunch and were told we would have a long wait a they were so busy a it wa a saturday whilst we were at the hotel the sri lankan and indian national cricket team were there the hotel focus wa totally on them and important member of staff were moved to run the catering at the match this wa very much noticed by guest at the hotel a the service in the restaurant became ridiculously slow and many mistake were made the people of sri lanka our lovely and very kind and helpful and we felt totally safe when we wandered along the beach way from the hotel we met a fantastic driver who wa wonderful in showing u around and really looked after our child he is a recommended driver at the hotel and his name is erish we had some absolutely wonderful experience when he took u out a he really worked to make sure we saw everything and enjoyed ourselves he is also a good driver and very safe which is quite a rarity in sri lanka,2212,415,4.332530120481928,3,0.9846,0.124,0.074,0.802,0.09775332225913623,0.55390550018457

"In general: Architecturally very generously designed hotel complex with beautiful green areas directly on the Indian Ocean. The hotel definitely stands out from other hotels due to the friendliness and exceptional service of the staff. Thanks for letting me be part of the Heritance family for three weeks. I will definitely come back. Rooms: The rooms are larger than average and have a kettle and refrigerator in addition to the general standard. Recommended is the “laundry service”, fast, clean and inexpensive. The housekeeping was good, thanks for the towel animals or flowers on my bed. In the evening the bed was revealed, the curtains were closed and if necessary the towels were changed again. Restaurant/Bars: In the restaurant, the high level of service is noticeable. You are led to a table set with cloth napkins and bread plates at each meal. Light background music underlines the atmosphere. Thank you Duminda, the good soul of the restaurant, and thank you Jananja for the always professional service. The offer as well as the quality of the food were above average and prepared with a lot of attention to detail. Extra wishes were also gladly fulfilled. Thanks for that, Kavindu. I was lucky enough to be able to take part in the gigantic buffets on Christmas and New Year's Eve. Chapeau Keshan!!! Service: The absolute plus of the hotel is the leadership and exceptional service of the staff. You always feel welcome as a guest. Staff are always friendly. As a solo traveler, I never felt lonely, but rather as part of the hotel family. Danke an Jayaru, Guest Relations Executive. She's helped me with some of my affairs.

"Me and my family stayed on FB basis for one day at heritance, ahungalle in october. the best thing was the food there. However, except for the welcoming staff at entrances staff was un or minimally attentive most of the time, of course they attend to us if we go and poke them repeatedly. we have booked a triple room and checked in around 4pm but there were twin beds in the room and after repeatedly reminding them they finally added an extra foldable bed. the person who brought the bed looked like a senior for that area, when we complained he just muttered something like 'twin bed room is the only room type available at heritance when you book a triple room and we always add an extra bed , only difference is you will get meals for 3 people' and walked away rapidly, on us... there were no room amenities in the room- no iron or ironing board, no water for three people, no slippers ,toothbrushes, cups etc at all. when we needed something we had to call and wait and call again . ultimately one person appeared with a trolley and instead of replacing missing items asked us to take whatever missing in the room. and the dark color pillow covers were so dirty we just kept them away. no one has bothered to change them for ages . safe was not functioning and when we typed numbers it missed some and got locked,then the person who attended late to fix it couldnt identify that its battery was low. finally it was fixed and by about 8.30 we managed to go for dinner. it may be due to overcrowded hotel but they already had 2 hours extra to check the room beforehand since we were late for check in. meals were good, staff was also more attentive. no one offered a baby high seater for our 3 year old and we had to go after them at all the 3 meals for a chair... restaurant is overcrowded and no one is there to offer water or clean tableware. they are only interested in taking plates away, at least that's a good thing. chefs and the restaurant manager were very supportive and offered some food for our baby , they were kind enough to deliver the dishes to our room as well. There is no sea view from the room and there was some construction work going on right next to our room which we didnt mind much.. next morning we asked them to take the plates away but no one showed up. by 1pm we were ready to check out and until that time no cleaning was done and room smelled of stale food. overall we didnt mind it as it was a one night thing ,tolerable on a full stomach and surely this place happens to be a typical siri lankan hotel, no matter how many stars they got,..",negative,me and my family stayed on fb basis for one day at heritance ahungalle in october the best thing wa the food there however except for the welcoming staff at entrance staff wa un or minimally attentive most of the time of course they attend to u if we go and poke them repeatedly we have booked a triple room and checked in around pm but there were twin bed in the room and after repeatedly reminding them they finally added an extra foldable bed the person who brought the bed looked like a senior for that area when we complained he just muttered something like twin bed room is the only room type available at heritance when you book a triple room and we always add an extra bed only difference is you will get meal for people and walked away rapidly on u there were no room amenity in the room no iron or ironing board no water for three people no slipper toothbrush cup etc at all when we needed something we had to call and wait and call again ultimately one person appeared with a trolley and instead of replacing missing item asked u to take whatever missing in the room and the dark color pillow cover were so dirty we just kept them away no one ha bothered to change them for age safe wa not functioning and when we typed number it missed some and got lockedthen the person who attended late to fix it couldnt identify that it battery wa low finally it wa fixed and by about we managed to go for dinner it may be due to overcrowded hotel but they already had hour extra to check the room beforehand since we were late for check in meal were good staff wa also more attentive no one offered a baby high seater for our year old and we had to go after them at all the meal for a chair restaurant is overcrowded and no one is there to offer water or clean tableware they are only interested in taking plate away at least thats a good thing chef and the restaurant manager were very supportive and offered some food for our baby they were kind enough to deliver the dish to our room a well there is no sea view from the room and there wa some construction work going on right next to our room which we didnt mind much next morning we asked them to take the plate away but no one showed up by pm we were ready to check out and until that time no cleaning wa done and room smelled of stale food overall we didnt mind it a it wa a one night thing tolerable on a full stomach and surely this place happens to be a typical siri lankan hotel no matter how many star they got,2578,493,4.231237322515213,1,-0.2266,0.084,0.093,0.823,0.13088509316770186,0.5171652864044168

Food and the buffet was terrible. Only few options were there for vegetarians. They have not given their attention to minor things. For an example I had to request a different salt shakers during ALL the THREE meals I had during my stay. (One table didn’t have any salt/ pepper shakes, other two times - the salt was stuck in the shaker) . Also the arrangement of the buffet was hideous. Food were all over the place.

"We stayed here for two nights. At first we were given a standard room, but our toilet was not working. So thankfully we were upgraded. After this small hitch, all our tour group was upgraded. This lovely hotel, has two beautiful pools and it is quiet and relaxing. The food at this hotel is also good, the staff are friendly and overall a pleasant stay. However on checkout much confusion with bills being mixed up within our tour group.

This was our second stay here and felt service and maintenance of the property had slipped considerably. Room are large and well equipped though a little bit dated. The pool and gardens are kept well however buildings were in a need of paint and maintenance. The service and food in the main restaurant were the worst we experienced throughout our stay travelling throughout Sri lanka. Breakfast was a good spread with plenty of variety, getting a cup of coffee took time though, sadly dinner was the worst experience we have had through our travels, the food was just slapped on, we were there for three nights and for two of the three nights we encounted empty dishes when we were serving and this was not replaced for a considerable amount of time, there was more emphasis on western dishes and sadly not much choice. We found service to be very slow, dishes were not picked up when one had finished their meals and staff were not every efficient compared to all the other resorts we have stayed in and we did choose this hotel given the positive feed back that was left on past experience.

"The good first - Hotel staff are all wonderful, helpful and the service slow but very friendly. The beachfront location is excellent. The food is good- even the buffet - which I normally dislike with a vengeance was above average, but the fining dining experience (lobster) was excellent and the coffee shop a la carte was also very good. The main pool is fabulous and the other okay - but the Jacuzzi is dreadful - small, old and uninviting. The bad - oh dear!! The rooms are drab, dysfunctional and this was after 3 changes!! We arrived tired after a long drive from Kandy and were given a twin despite requesting a double - when we complained we were moved to a double and told this was an upgrade - despite it being exactly as the other but on a different floor! Complain again - as this was supposed to be a 5 star - and the room was very tired - and we were told that we could move the following day to a luxury suite but not until 5pm. Trying to be accommodating and not spoil a so far wonderful trip to Sri Lanka we agreed not to unpack and move rooms the following evening. But, three rooms later - okay this was larger - a very large separate, very stark work room - with a private balcony and wonderful views but the air conditioning didn't work in the bedroom, there were cigarette buts on the balcony and the shower (which my husband couldn't stand under - built for little people) leaked to wet the entire bathroom floor. However, the wonderful staff, sous chef, and just about everyone we met were so lovely we forgave everything. But this is NOT a luxury hotel!! Just a very standard hotel charging luxury prices and it will be interesting when the 501 roomed giant opens its doors next door to see if it survives.

"Heritance Ahungalle Hotel is a great retreat in Sri Lanka, but you must adjust your expectations before moving in. We had booked a de-lux room with balcony overlooking the beach and ocean - romantic, eh?Unfortunately, the hotel and consequently the room was very 'tired' and had seen better days. The hotel even suffered poorly maintained sidewalks, tennis courts, beach loungers, etc. Most was simply under maintained. Our balcony was adjacent to the rooms on either side, separated only by planters, and the view of beach and ocean obscured by a large (but beautiful) tree. It may not have been a problem anyway, as on the second day of our stay, the hotel maintenance people set up a huge beach-obscuring marquee (JAG_68056) for another wedding. They have about 20 weddings per year, so we learned. Perhaps that wasn't so bad either, but the band wars (wedding band, bar music, and local flute player) that ensued developed an impossible cacophony of loud music which made it impossible to sleep. Our 'package' was directly booked through Heritance's agent: bed and breakfast. We soon discovered there were many alternate 'packages' which ranged from full board to 'good deals' offering better accommodation for less than we paid. Check it out before 'checking in'. The food was good, especially the buffet (good value and variety) ... but the beach-hawkers were definitely a deterrent from enjoying the beach. The hotel should definitely do something about them! They were ever-present from sun up to sun down. The redeeming feature of the hotel was the always friendly and hospitable staff ... always willing to serve and support. The Guest Relations team did their very best. One last word of advice would be to insist that any Ahungalla-related transportation from Colombo Airport to the hotel take the new highway ... it seems that the drivers attempt to circumvent the highway-toll gates by taking secondary roads which are long, uncomfortable, dangerous, and nauseating.

"Consistent with the other recent reviews we were scheduled to stay at the Heritance for the final three days of our SL tour. However, we checked out after the first night. On a positive note, the room was clean and recently refurbished. The food in the optional al à carte restaurant was also good and the restaurant staff very friendly and efficient. On the other hand, the hotel is extremely large with many guests on “all you can eat” inclusive deals. This created a very different feel to other hotels we stayed in. The staff were a mixed bag.

"We have just returned from a 2 week stay at the heritance. We travelled as a family of 2 children 2 and 4 yrs plus granparents. We had an excellent time and would not hesitate to recommend this hotel. The architexture is stunning with a very calm atmosphere and a wonderful infinity pool that blends into the beach. The pictures don't do it justice. We stayed in their 2 interconnecting rooms 301 and 302 which were spacious and had excellent see views. They made them up as a king size and 2 singles which suited us great. You could hear the entertainment but it finished at a reasonable time. The ""animators"" were really helpful, building sandcastles and flying kites with the children. We all enjoyed the daily aqua aerobics. One of the best things about the hotel and sri lanka is the poeple. The were very friendly and genuine and made our stay one to remember. The service was very occasionally slightly chaotic in a nice sri lankan way, but everyone was very helpful. The food was the best that we tasted anywhere on our trip in the hotel. Breakfast is excellent and the food in the coffee shop was v tasty. The chinese and BBQ buffets were worth it and we weren't charged for the children. Drink prices were reasonable (we were charged twice as much in the hotel on our trip to Kandy). We did some trips around the area with Bertie from the sunshine resturant at the end of the beach. I would definitely recommend the river safari as not to be missed. This is an excellent choice for those looking for relaxation in a stunning setting.

"If you are into stuffing your face on buffets and booze, probably a great hotel for you. If you are looking for quality food and culture, or even 5 star service probably not for you. Outwardly the hotel looks great, they rely on the great infinity pool for the wow factor but scratch the surface and there is not much else a pontins holiday park wouldn't provide. Probably why there are limited photo's on the website apart from the pool. We paid extra for a luxury room, which was very nice but cost enough to justify. The room along with the friendly staff were the best parts of the holiday. Breakfast was average, dark, dingy, smokey (cooking smoke) buffet room. Nice cooked options, and hoppers. Waffles were very nice, but coffee served was just terrible. Green pool was OK, but cloudy water. Good green pool service Nice beach, but not worth visiting due to the constant hassle. People have to earn a living but it gets a bit draining to be friendly, only to be hassled to buy something every time you want to walk along the beach. Grotty and hot gym, with old equipment. Miles away from anywhere, so unless you want a 1/2hr tuk tuk ride to Bentota (which is fine and plenty of offers outside the gate) you are stuck with hotel options. The best food we found was in the mustard cafe, lovely curries. Everything else was overpriced euro buffet. Final nail in the coffin was check-out, no service at the nice reception desk, you go round to the back office, smelly little room where you que up to pay your $$$$ bill while the cashier argues and discusses other bills with clients and colleagues. Then the taxi you ordered with the concierge isn't booked after all, they just look at each other and call over the 20 year old smelly wagon. We refused to get in, and they got an equally smelly but slightly newer car for the 9000 rupee ride to Colombo. Smelly is a reoccurring issue here.

"We are a European Asian couple who came to Sri Lanka for our Winter vacations. We admire Geoffrey Bawa as a legendary architect and decided to come to one of the hotels designed by him to live his work for real. So We booked two nights in Heritance Ahungalla. Today is the second night of our stay and we just left the beautiful beach after the music reached the point of a super loud sound test. When we checked in we were made to sit and wait in front of a really loud bad music group. We complained a few times about the loud music right in our ear but they smiled and continued, forcing us to move away with our bags. Otherwise the treatment we got in checkin process was cool. But all the good mood was gone thanks to the awful music. Bawa designed his buildings in a way that the outside is coming to the inside and there are lots of open spaces. So really bad music in full volume means that you will hear it all over the hotel even in your own corridor. We complained more than 10 times and witnessed that other tourists were laughing at the music and walked away as far from the lobby as they could. The hotel management put really ugly ridiculous christmas decoration in the lobby and inside the beautiful infinity pool making, a big mockery of Bawa who designed the lobby so that you see the sea behind the infinity pool. The food was okay, nothing special other than a terrible vegetable chop suey and vegetable fried rice we got for yesterdays lunch. They have great freshly baked bread and spreads which we loved. And nice veggie burgers. Our room was interesting, as it seems to be originally as designed by Bawa years ago. The mini bar was dirty inside and the refrigerator quite rusty. The wifi worked well for my computer every where in the hotel, but my wife had not as much as luck as i did. The staff were trying to give us a friendly face and some times we met nice people. A front desk guy called Khan was really funny and cool to talk to when he helped us secure the late checkout which we were promised via booking.com. The dining area got really wet under my own feet with lots of rain water this morning when it was heavily raining. Our corridor and the bar/ reception area was flooded because the roofs and windows were leaking. They have amazing pools designed by Bawa and we used every opportunity jump in to them. The hotel is an architectural masterpiece and in a very cool location. However, the company that runs it seems to be treating this paradise for architectural lovers as just a another cheaply run 5 star hotel to use as space for mega groups they bus in to maximise profit. The loud music and badly maintained building may kill it for most. For us, we will not come again unless some miracle happens tomorrow.

They were very aggressive in the way they would wait for you to leave the safety of your hotel sun-lounger, and try and sell you everything under the sun. Just be firm and say nothing else other than 'NO!' If you engage them in conversation, they will pester you ALL DAY. We saw others suffer as a result of this and the hotel must do something about it. Worse still, there are sellers operating within the hotel itself, pestering you for palm readings and the purchase of overpriced wooden ornaments. The hotel management need to realise that the hotel should be a refuge from some of the hard-sell that exists out in the surrounding towns. Also the hotel did not seem particularly clean, and the food was distinctly average at both the Upper Room restaurant, and the 24-hour restaurant. There was some renovation work going on, but I didn't let it effect my overall view as all hotels need to do it at some point. Normally hate to be too critical, but there are some issues that need to be addressed before this one can call itself 5 Star.",neutral,stayed here for night a part of a tour around southern sri lanka the positive large pool very helpful staff well appointed room large bathroom the negative are more numerous and sadly affected the enjoyment of our stay there were about local hanging around on the beach outside the hotel for the whole time on both day they were very aggressive in the way they would wait for you to leave the safety of your hotel sunlounger and try and sell you everything under the sun just be firm and say nothing else other than no if you engage them in conversation they will pester you all day we saw others suffer a a result of this and the hotel must do something about it worse still there are seller operating within the hotel itself pestering you for palm reading and the purchase of overpriced wooden ornament the hotel management need to realise that the hotel should be a refuge from some of the hardsell that exists out in the surrounding town also the hotel did not seem particularly clean and the food wa distinctly average at both the upper room restaurant and the hour restaurant there wa some renovation work going on but i didnt let it effect my overall view a all hotel need to do it at some point normally hate to be too critical but there are some issue that need to be addressed before this one can call itself star,1376,249,4.530120481927711,2,-0.8115,0.044,0.076,0.88,-0.015550595238095244,0.4041071428571429
"The hotel was built in the early 1980s in the Sri Lankan style. Helpful and nice service, trouble-free contact in English. Rooms clean and spacious.

"We visited to celebrate our anniversary. Even though its quite apparent that we are a couple, a twin room was provided. In the reservation page its mentioned about a sea view room (""best perhaps are the private balconies – from where it will seem as if the sunsets are ablaze in glory, just for you""). The photo also showing a sea view room. But we were given a garden view room in an isolated corner. When inquired the answer was ""sorry sir we are full today"". Its not an excuse. I must mention that we were not late for our check in . Actually we came around 12.30pm because we planned to have the lunch as well . Then moving to the condition of the room itself, It's very old looking small one. The doors were rusted, stained & discolored. The Bathroom is small, ancient & basic. Walls faded & definitely need painting & renovation. Even most of the 2-3 star level hotels provided a much superior rooms than this. Neither Toothpaste, toothbrush nor shaving items provided which are expected to be provided in a 5 star hotel. We had to asked for it. When asked they have provided us with two packs of toothbrushes & only one of them had a tiny toothpaste for us two. Anyway we manged it economically for two days although both of us used to brush teeth after each & every meal. We didn't bring those because all the other five star hotels we have visited have provided them without any fuss & we honestly expected this hotel to be the same standard level. I noticed the lack of the shaving kit only in the next day morning. I knew i had to ask for it again. But as we are checking out anyway i didn't bother the housekeeping staff early in the morning and left my self unsaved for the breakfast. I'm wondering whether they are providing older rooms especailly for the discounted booking offers. We reserved Heritance Ahungalla thinking that they would provide with the same exceptional service like their Heritance Kandalama which we visited sometime back. Anyway we have determined to avoid Heritance hotels here after as its not worthy taking any risk ,after our anniversary got totally ruined.

We checked in on the first week of Oct. The check in staff was friendly and welcomed us with a refreshing drink. The room was spacious but we received two single beds for me and my husband. Which I found really ridiculous. They should have inquired regarding this when we made the reservation or at check in. When we asked to change they said the hotel was fully booked. We then asked the housekeeping to dress the beds with a single double bed sheet. Which still didn't make a big difference. The room fridge and the phone was not working. Informed them and they replaced it. The rooms need refurbishment and new equipment. The lunch buffet was not that great. The Srilankan option was good but the other dishes were not tasty. The starter section looked really pathetic. And added to that the prawns were not de-veined. Which was unacceptable. The waiting staff was dazed. We had to ask for water. Nobody escorted us to tables. The staff was basically a little lost. During dinner they had barbecue going on which was good. They had a seafood dish again the most prawns were not de - veined again. Brought it to the attention of the management and informed them that there could be consiquences for consuming non de - veined prawns. They apologised and offered to get something else. I informed them I don't need anything else but to keep the kitchen staff informed regarding this. Breakfast was good and tasty. Again during breakfast the waiting staff was lost. Asked for coffee and never got it. I just left it. The other complaint is to get more high chairs for kids to restaurant because our friends needed a high chair and everything was taken. So if the hotel is full there is no option. But I have to tell that hands down the best buffets to go to for is heritance Kandalama and Negombo.

"We have just enjoyed a relaxing time at this hotel celebrating our wedding anniversary. The hotel provides a beautiful setting on the sea front with lovely gardens and two large pools clean and well maintained. The Pool staff are very attentive to guests needs when using these facilities. Whilst the local area is very quiet this is a good location from which to explore the South Western coastline of Sri Lanka and access to a number of popular tourist spots nearby. The staff at this hotel have been superb, eager to please guests and happy to ‘go that extra mile’ to make visitors feel welcomed. We must give special mention to the following staff for their hard work and for making our stay feel extra special - Jacob, Asitha, Jagath, Nimsara and Sinari. A big thank you also to Lokusuviya for his hardworking cleaning and tidying our room each day and the really friendly young man serving in the hotel gift shop! The food served in the main dining room was of a good quality and always offered a good choice of different Asian and Western dishes. We also took advantage of the drinks and snacks regularly available at the Pool side snack bar! During our stay here we were lucky to enjoy all the festivities and additional events organised by the hotel to celebrate their special New Year. We booked several trips during our stay with Rasika, a local guide, who can be found at the edge of the hotel/beach front. He offers good value and local knowledge/experience and we were happy to support local people rather than the large companies. We were fortunate to enjoy the Elephant Safari at Udawalawa, the Madu river cruise, a day trip to the Galle Fort town and spent time at Hikkaduwa swimming with the large Turtles. We also arranged to see the iconic Stilt Fishermen, the rather moving Tsunami Museum and spent time relaxing on the lovely beach at Unawatuna.

"My friend and I stayed at this hotel for the last 4 days of our sri lankan tour. We stopped off at the turtle sanctuary beforehand which was very cute (15 mins ish from hotel) we had a lovely greeting at the hotel- staff very pleasant. Our room was sweet, we got a complimentary upgrade. Spacious room, lovely sea view. Room a little old, could do with a bit of a spruce up. Poolside and beach were very quiet, got a sun bed every day. The ""beach boys"" were quite annoying and pushy but on the last day we bought something from the ladies and gave them some of our stuff, they are poor so appreciated it.

"We stayed at this hotel for five days from the 13-18 February, in a superior room, on the ground floor overlooking the gardens with a partial sea view. From arrival it was apparent that the room had a stale smell that had been unsuccessfully masked by the cleaning staff using cloves to hide the odour.In general terms the rooms are large,although extremely outdated by the original 1980's décor. Limited attempts have been made to upgrade the bathroom by the replacement of the original sanitary ware. Although bare plaster,binding door,pop-up wastes that do not seal negate part of this exercise. The restaurant prides itself on the training of its Chefs,although has considerable difficulties in balancing the menu to provide a mixture between eastern and western food.There is little provision for some travellers who may not want to eat Sri Lankan food for the whole of their holidays. This was mentioned on more than one occasion to the Assistant Sous Chef,and The Sous Chef,who provided a detailed tour of the Kitchen,although no indication why the menu is so one sided. The restaurant is open between 7-10 pm,when we arrived at 8.30 pm most of the salad trays where empty and had not been replaced. The one European dish,pasta, had two spoonfuls of ""penna"" left in the tray. When we queried this with the Assistant Sous Chef he asked what we would like to eat?,and this could be prepared for us.I also noted that many of the dessert trays where empty and would be withdrawn and not replaced,normally at 8.45pm.

"We spent 3 weeks in Sri Lanka and stayed in 12 hotels and this we ranked last at number 12. On arrival our room was not ready despite it had gone 14:00. We were told this was due to a late check out and we were made to wait at reception without any offer of a refreshment. We reserved a table for evening food and upon arriving at the reserved time the table had been given to another group. We received phone calls on both mornings waking us up. One was at 07:30 regarding some washing being ready for us despite not having any done. The laundry department were insistent it was ours and then Hung up when we told them it was not. When we tried to speak to management we had to ask three times and after 10hrs we got to speak to a manager. They heard our complaint and offered half price food for the evening as a good will gesture. The buffet was on par with other hotels and the restaurant food was very good. Unfortunately despite the managers efforts at departure time we were phoned regarding when to collect our bags. We asked for 10 minutes time which they said they could do. After 25 minutes we walked our own luggage to reception and left the hotel in the same style we arrived, little to no service. During our visit some of the facilities were shut despite the hotel supposedly being fully booked. The room was fine and clean but the communal areas looked tired and not what was expected from a 4 Star hotel. The restaurants lacked soul and character. Due to our experience I can not recommend this hotel and I would question the awards and endorsements it has. I hope that others receive better service than we did given the price.

It was a very warm welcome from the staff. And took so long time for checking process even though it was not a busy time. The room we received was not at the expected quality and filled with flyers. We had to request several times to remove flyers and finally we requested for new room since we were with an infant. Initially they rejected our request and I had to talk to FOM to get a new room. So until 6. 30 pm from the time we checked in (3.30pm). It was such a unpleasant experience. Other room services were all good. Restaurant services and foods was very good.

And when you leave your room for breakfast, you can see a family of monkeys, which is located on the branches of the nearest trees. A very funny sight. There were no problems with food, as there are dishes of both local and more familiar cuisine for us. Another pleasant feature of the hotel is that the beach is located some 100 meters from the hotel. Since during our trip there was quarantine in the country, nevertheless, we did not feel any inconvenience, because the ocean was within walking distance. I would also like to mention the staff of the pool bar and in particular Mr. Darshana. Very nice person, brilliant employee and very friendly guy. Always ready to serve and help.

"We ended off our holiday in Sri Lanka at this hotel, booked in for 3 nights. It was a perfect decision as it was pure bliss and relaxation. The hotel offers various amenities to allow you to unwind, with two swimming pools (one overlooking the ocean and another more secluded) while being situated along the beach from where you can take a dip into the ocean. Other amenities include table tennis, a gym and in-house entertainment such as live music and performances. The staff service is friendly, efficient and professional, while the food is good (not too spicy overall but a decent array to choose from). Our dining experience was made memorable with exceptional service from Malake during breakfasts and dinners. The rooms were clean, comfortable and spacious with a balcony overlooking the ocean. The hotel premises were always kept neat and tidy while offering sufficient space to walk around or relax on a pool chair. Overall I would certainly recommended this hotel to any couple or family looking for a place to relax and unwind while being taken care of at a world-class and luxury hotel.

"Driven by excellent previous experiences we had at Heritance Kandalama, we booked a 3 nights’ half-board stay at Ahungalla with similar expectations: that we will receive a service in accordance to a 5 stars hotel, customer oriented and with attention to detail. But unfortunately this was not the case. With the exception of the reception staff who was very friendly and efficient, the rest was below the average, especially at the main restaurant. On more than one occasion had to make exaggerated gestures to catch the waiters’ attention and had to repeat our order of water and or coffee during breakfast and dinner. The used plates were often not removed, so we either had to again make exaggerated gestures to get the assistance of a waiter or make room ourselves. On top of that, getting the food from the buffet was quite a stressful experience by having to dodge tables, chairs and people (it was way too crowded!). Likewise, we faced a similar situation at the infinity pool bar. Given that the waiter was taking too long to come –we opted for standing up and going to the bar too make our order. Then we had to do a similar thing to get the bill as well. It was also quite unfortunate that the bar from the guests’ pool was not operative and no equipment was provided to get a better use of the lovely beach (lounge chairs and sunshades).

It was one of the worst cakes that looked like it had been bought from the cheapest bakery in town. The common area toilets were so filthy I dreaded going there more than once.

"We checked into the hotel the day before a public holiday. Following day while chatting to a waiter he said there is going to be a huge crowd for lunch hence come by 12:30.

"Heritance Ahungalla would be a great location for a couples retreat, provided they make a few improvements. The hotel is situated in a slightly secluded area (15-20 minutes away from Galle city), is a heart-warming relic of colonial era architecture, and has a marvelous private beach and other relevant amenities. However, it can become even better if the service quality is improved. I had a bitter experience checking in as I waited for almost half an hour before anyone attended me, and even then it took the staff forever to complete the formalities. One would generally expect the staff of a 5-star hotel to be more competent and efficient. Moreover, the staff seemed confused when I asked them for advice on travelling around Galle. I stayed in a twin sharing room (I was there on a conference). While the room was nice, the bathroom seemed a little worn down and I felt needed to be revamped.",neutral,heritance ahungalla would be a great location for a couple retreat provided they make a few improvement the hotel is situated in a slightly secluded area minute away from galle city is a heartwarming relic of colonial era architecture and ha a marvelous private beach and other relevant amenity however it can become even better if the service quality is improved i had a bitter experience checking in a i waited for almost half an hour before anyone attended me and even then it took the staff forever to complete the formality one would generally expect the staff of a star hotel to be more competent and efficient moreover the staff seemed confused when i asked them for advice on travelling around galle i stayed in a twin sharing room i wa there on a conference while the room wa nice the bathroom seemed a little worn down and i felt needed to be revamped,900,156,4.7756410256410255,2,0.9696,0.164,0.039,0.797,0.16381172839506172,0.521604938271605
"The location on the beach is great, calm and scenic, close to the water. The hotel pool area is good and quite high level of service around the pool. Some days the pool area was not so quite that we had expected. Layout of the hotel is fine but it need some updating and I understand it will take place in April this year. Communication among staff was non existing, service quite low if you rate yourself as a 5 star hotel, which it is not compared to international standard. The food did not live up to a 5 star hotel standard, medium quality to quite high rates. Breakfast was rather chaotic and serice level among staff low. It seemed as staff wanted to delivery a good service but did not know how. Only on the very last day they checked in and ask how it was and if we were satisfied. Shops in the hotel area were very boring and expensive and far from 5 star hotel standard, recommend to either close or improve a lot.

"A short midweek trip with family and friends. Check in took a tad longer than expected. Booked a suit which was located centrally close to both pools and had a large sitting room separate from the bed room. it was excellent as we could have a get together with friends whilst the kids slept in. The spacious balcony opened out to a view of the hotel pools n garden, the golden sands and the westward sea. As it was a midweek day with less crowd, was not expecting much of a spread at the buffet, How wrong I was! It was less than on a weekend but still could hold its own with any hotel's weekend spread. Any foreign guest gets introduced to a good selection of Sri Lankan specialities, Italian pasta station to Indian Doses to Mongolian mixed rice action stations were all busily catering to individual requirements. The fruit selection at breakfast was amazing. The staff are friendly and helpful. Rooms were spotlessly clean. Pradeep the manager at the dinning hall was super!

This is the worst hotel I’ve ever stayed. Not compared to other 5 star hotels even just some random hotel with no star ratings is better than this. Our check-in was at 2.00 and we arrived at about 1.50 and the person there asked if we are starting from dinner and she said lunch will be closing at 2.30. once we went to get the lunch all the tables were full. they told us to wait outside till a table is available. we booked 2 sea view rooms and only view we got was pool. rooms were not cleaned properly. you cannot even walk barefoot on those floors. bathrooms were dirty and not properly maintained. we went to the pool at about 7.00pm and the person there told us the pool will be closing in 10 minutes. but when we asked before they told they close the pool at 8.00pm. the guy at the pool don’t know how to speak to people. after 10 minutes he came back and told us to leave. there was a lasagna at dinner buffet that smelled really bad.
