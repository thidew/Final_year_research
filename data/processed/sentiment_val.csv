"After visiting the sister hotel in dambulla, I had high expectations for customer service. However I was sadly disappointed apart from a very few members of staff. We arrived after touring Sri Lanka for our honeymoon for a rew days relaxation by the beach.. Dispite the local security we were often harrassed by the local ""beach boys"". A stroll on the beach was anything but relaxing. Although not a private beach the constant calling and shouting at by the locals was very annoying. Even after explaining we were on our honeymoon we were still surrounded by a number of the locals. Obviously this is made worse by the lack of security at the hotel, which allows locals to stroll around even to the resident only pool. After on evening sitting for a pre dinner drink I noticed a number of flis around and which point my husband pointed the food and liquid on the adjacent table. After letting the staff know and expecting a prompt clean up, nothing was done about the mess. In comparison to other hotels within this chain and other hotels we stayed at the hotel was not well maintained. I never saw anyone clean the main lobby and bar areas dispite obvious mess. In fact e only time I say a brush was during a lunchtime of heavy rain to brush the water out and this was only done once. There is a lack of information provided by the hotel. This could easily be rectified by adding a little more information into the room guide. Information about the surrounding area, places to visit and information about food within the restaurant. The hotel food however was of brilliant quality. We enjoyed a meal at the fine dining restaurant and can say this food would not have been out of place at any top london restaurant. The food at the the al a carte restaurant was also of a good standard. The evening buffet was expensive and so we avoided this as we felt it would be poor value and probably poor service what experience we had of breakfast. Now breakfast was a terrible fair, although a wide selection of food not enough waiters or chefs. We came down for breakfast at various times, but noticed if we came after 9.30 no one was around to provide tea or coffee or chefs to cook the food. If we came earlier it was so busy we had to queue for the dishes and the cold foods we're not refilled often enough. Rooms were of a good size and clean. However try to get a room a reasonable distance from the lobby as this can be noisy especially on the weekend. All in all this hotel has the basis for being lovely. The food was good, the views gorgeous, just a little more customer service and focus would improve anyone's experience massively. Maybe the staff here should vist kanadlama or the tea factory for some tips!",negative,after visiting the sister hotel in dambulla i had high expectation for customer service however i wa sadly disappointed apart from a very few member of staff we arrived after touring sri lanka for our honeymoon for a rew day relaxation by the beach dispite the local security we were often harrassed by the local beach boy a stroll on the beach wa anything but relaxing although not a private beach the constant calling and shouting at by the local wa very annoying even after explaining we were on our honeymoon we were still surrounded by a number of the local obviously this is made worse by the lack of security at the hotel which allows local to stroll around even to the resident only pool after on evening sitting for a pre dinner drink i noticed a number of flis around and which point my husband pointed the food and liquid on the adjacent table after letting the staff know and expecting a prompt clean up nothing wa done about the mess in comparison to other hotel within this chain and other hotel we stayed at the hotel wa not well maintained i never saw anyone clean the main lobby and bar area dispite obvious mess in fact e only time i say a brush wa during a lunchtime of heavy rain to brush the water out and this wa only done once there is a lack of information provided by the hotel this could easily be rectified by adding a little more information into the room guide information about the surrounding area place to visit and information about food within the restaurant the hotel food however wa of brilliant quality we enjoyed a meal at the fine dining restaurant and can say this food would not have been out of place at any top london restaurant the food at the the al a carte restaurant wa also of a good standard the evening buffet wa expensive and so we avoided this a we felt it would be poor value and probably poor service what experience we had of breakfast now breakfast wa a terrible fair although a wide selection of food not enough waiter or chef we came down for breakfast at various time but noticed if we came after no one wa around to provide tea or coffee or chef to cook the food if we came earlier it wa so busy we had to queue for the dish and the cold food were not refilled often enough room were of a good size and clean however try to get a room a reasonable distance from the lobby a this can be noisy especially on the weekend all in all this hotel ha the basis for being lovely the food wa good the view gorgeous just a little more customer service and focus would improve anyones experience massively maybe the staff here should vist kanadlama or the tea factory for some tip,2712,496,4.469758064516129,-1,0.9712,0.126,0.087,0.787,0.05066872427983538,0.5765534979423869

"I stayed at the Heritance at the end of October for 3 days. The hotel is beautiful and makes the most of it's stunning surroundings. We opted for half board and were very impressed with the selection of food on offer for breakfast and dinner. The live cooking stations were a great addition. The staff were very friendly and made an effort to remember us and our preferences. The infinity pool is large and lovely, and as we went out of season there were plenty of sun loungers. However there didn't seem enough if the hotel was full. The only downside was the electrics and power points in the room. During our short stay we had three power cuts, the only power sockets in the room that we could use where to power the telly and mini-bar so we would have to simultaneously remove one to be able to charge phones, or straighten hair. The other sockets available didn't fit any sort of travel plug (I'd packed a world compatible one and it still didn't work!) the room comes with a kettle and tea making facilities however even the kettle plug didn't fit in the sockets!

"The stunning view beach is the only positive memory that we have from our stay. Otherwise the hotel is dated, poorly managed, and many unmaintained facilities. Air conditioning, ceiling fan in our room did not work. The door locks in our room to the bathroom and balcony were broken. Considering that balconies from other rooms are essentially interconnected, there was little or no security from the balcony side of our room. The main restaurant buffet is expensive and of poor cafeteria style food. Very little flair to the food, designed to please those who did not really want to leave home. Entertainment in the lobby at night is essentially Karaoke musicians mouthing CD music. The hotel was built in the 1960s and it seems nothing was done to improve or redecorate the place since it's initial opening. It is a nice visit back to a mid 1960's contemporary architecture that has a seedy ambiance. The staff is friendly and helpful as long as it does not involve complicated activities such as room maintenance, directions to anywhere, or being served coffee in the restaurants. The hotel has no control over the touts in front of the hotel nor at the beach. These touts are of course part of the scenery but makes the guests not want to wander onto the beach since they will not leave visitors alone and will not take no as an answer. It is a sad commentary of Sri Lanka, but the hotel could do more to discourage these parasites.",negative,the stunning view beach is the only positive memory that we have from our stay otherwise the hotel is dated poorly managed and many unmaintained facility air conditioning ceiling fan in our room did not work the door lock in our room to the bathroom and balcony were broken considering that balcony from other room are essentially interconnected there wa little or no security from the balcony side of our room the main restaurant buffet is expensive and of poor cafeteria style food very little flair to the food designed to please those who did not really want to leave home entertainment in the lobby at night is essentially karaoke musician mouthing cd music the hotel wa built in the s and it seems nothing wa done to improve or redecorate the place since it initial opening it is a nice visit back to a mid s contemporary architecture that ha a seedy ambiance the staff is friendly and helpful a long a it doe not involve complicated activity such a room maintenance direction to anywhere or being served coffee in the restaurant the hotel ha no control over the tout in front of the hotel nor at the beach these tout are of course part of the scenery but make the guest not want to wander onto the beach since they will not leave visitor alone and will not take no a an answer it is a sad commentary of sri lanka but the hotel could do more to discourage these parasite,1436,253,4.679841897233201,1,0.1247,0.087,0.082,0.831,-0.014255536130536138,0.5027097902097902

"We have just returned from a three week stay at the Heritance Hotel. Hotel was basically good, everything worked, including the staff who, if anything, could be overly attentive. Rooms were stylish, had plenty of storage space and were serviced twice daily. Balconies had views across the beach to the setting sun. Some guests complained of minor faults, e.g. our fridge broke down but was repaired the same morning. Food was a good as could be expected with Buffet Service and we were never bored, although the dining room could be noisy. The hotel is proud of its swimming pools and rightly so. Attentive pool boys and life guards ensure there is not the usual scramble for beds and towels. We actually preferred the second (residents) pool to that shown in all the literature. The beach was regularly cleaned and patrolled. Constant slight surf, no problems for even moderate swimmers but small children should be supervised. The hotel’s main drawback is its isolation. Locally, there is simply nowhere to go and little to do. Ahungalla village consists of some 70 yards of dilapidated shacks selling local produce and a few basics at blatantly ’tourist’ and local prices. There is also a passable bakery, a pharmacy, a bank with no ATM and a railway station at which few trains actually stop. There are two bus services and two qualities of bus i.e. Air Conditioned and Local. It is difficult to ascertain what is a public bus, as opposed to touring or private hire and even more difficult to have them stop. Heritance guests are not expected to want to walk anywhere, let alone get on a bus. The weather was good. It rained frequently but usually in late evening and accompanied by spectacular lightning. Mosquitoes are in evidence and, despite a wall plug device and sprays we were both bitten frequently. Guests attempting to leave the hotel by the main entrance have to run the gauntlet of a persistent group of motorised tricycle (Tuk Tuk) taxi drivers who will resort to any device to have you hire them. In addition, the driver will insist on waiting for you and interfere with your activities. Their constant attentions became oppressive, more so than had we stayed in Bentota or Hikkaduwa where there are more hotels, more activities, thereby more tourists to go around. Beach vendors were a nuisance but were not permitted onto hotel premises. A fellow female guests was accosted on the beach some 200yds from the hotel and robbed of her hat and wrap. This was however an isolated incident and we found the local people welcoming and keen to promote their countries new found stability. Expeditions were possible, 400 yards North along the beach to a fish restaurant shack is worthwhile. I ordered Lobster and drank a local beer whist two young men went out with snorkels and a net to retrieve one. 800yds south along the Galle road, on the left, is the Lucky Lanka Spice Garden and Ayurvidic Centre run by a charming young man. Full body massage for £10 and a large selection of herbal potions to buy at ‘local’ prices. Other worthwhile excursions are a tour of lagoon at Balapitaya (or Bentota) with a visit to one island to see cinnamon being hand rolled by a wonderful old man and his elfin grand daughter. A morning’s snorkelling by Some at International Dive Centre, located at Coral Sands Hotel in Hikkaduwa is good value where there is an excellent parade of fish, including Octopus. The coral was badly damaged in the Tsunami but hopefully showing signs of a return. If Temples and/or elephants are your thing, then there are further trips afield, e.g Kandy, Yala National Park and Burwela Bird Sanctuary. However, from Ahungalla, both entail an expenditure of over £110 pp, an overnight stay and between 5-7 hours in a minivan, each way. In summary; great hotel but we chose the wrong location for the type of holiday we enjoy. To get the best from Sri Lanka we would recommend dividing time between the Highlands, forests, wildlife parks and beaches. If however, you want a hotel based beach stay for a few days, you would be pushed to find better. Sri Lanka has great potential, stunning scenery, culture, a vibrant history and the most glorious beaches I have seen.",neutral,we have just returned from a three week stay at the heritance hotel hotel wa basically good everything worked including the staff who if anything could be overly attentive room were stylish had plenty of storage space and were serviced twice daily balcony had view across the beach to the setting sun some guest complained of minor fault eg our fridge broke down but wa repaired the same morning food wa a good a could be expected with buffet service and we were never bored although the dining room could be noisy the hotel is proud of it swimming pool and rightly so attentive pool boy and life guard ensure there is not the usual scramble for bed and towel we actually preferred the second resident pool to that shown in all the literature the beach wa regularly cleaned and patrolled constant slight surf no problem for even moderate swimmer but small child should be supervised the hotel main drawback is it isolation locally there is simply nowhere to go and little to do ahungalla village consists of some yard of dilapidated shack selling local produce and a few basic at blatantly tourist and local price there is also a passable bakery a pharmacy a bank with no atm and a railway station at which few train actually stop there are two bus service and two quality of bus ie air conditioned and local it is difficult to ascertain what is a public bus a opposed to touring or private hire and even more difficult to have them stop heritance guest are not expected to want to walk anywhere let alone get on a bus the weather wa good it rained frequently but usually in late evening and accompanied by spectacular lightning mosquito are in evidence and despite a wall plug device and spray we were both bitten frequently guest attempting to leave the hotel by the main entrance have to run the gauntlet of a persistent group of motorised tricycle tuk tuk taxi driver who will resort to any device to have you hire them in addition the driver will insist on waiting for you and interfere with your activity their constant attention became oppressive more so than had we stayed in bentota or hikkaduwa where there are more hotel more activity thereby more tourist to go around beach vendor were a nuisance but were not permitted onto hotel premise a fellow female guest wa accosted on the beach some yds from the hotel and robbed of her hat and wrap this wa however an isolated incident and we found the local people welcoming and keen to promote their country new found stability expedition were possible yard north along the beach to a fish restaurant shack is worthwhile i ordered lobster and drank a local beer whist two young men went out with snorkel and a net to retrieve one yds south along the galle road on the left is the lucky lanka spice garden and ayurvidic centre run by a charming young man full body massage for and a large selection of herbal potion to buy at local price other worthwhile excursion are a tour of lagoon at balapitaya or bentota with a visit to one island to see cinnamon being hand rolled by a wonderful old man and his elfin grand daughter a morning snorkelling by some at international dive centre located at coral sand hotel in hikkaduwa is good value where there is an excellent parade of fish including octopus the coral wa badly damaged in the tsunami but hopefully showing sign of a return if temple andor elephant are your thing then there are further trip afield eg kandy yala national park and burwela bird sanctuary however from ahungalla both entail an expenditure of over pp an overnight stay and between hour in a minivan each way in summary great hotel but we chose the wrong location for the type of holiday we enjoy to get the best from sri lanka we would recommend dividing time between the highland forest wildlife park and beach if however you want a hotel based beach stay for a few day you would be pushed to find better sri lanka ha great potential stunning scenery culture a vibrant history and the most glorious beach i have seen,4192,723,4.799446749654218,2,0.9979,0.146,0.061,0.792,0.15813093560186586,0.44629153146595

"I went here just before Christmas, with friends. It's a lovely hotel - good rooms, nice food, good location (although sea swimming a bit rough). Gym, swimming pool, jacuzzi, free wi-fi, all the trappings. But the service just didn't match up - it was very pleasant. all the staff were extemely nice. But poor English, sloppy service, long waits when ordering anything. So although I'd recommend it, I do hope that Heritance take some time and trouble to train the staff properly - it's a great hotel, but the service lets it down. Biggest black mark was the very vocal hawkers on the beach - they stay just on the hotel boundary, and shout and harass the guests trying to sell things. Not pleasant at all, and really ruins what would otherwise be a restful and relaxing place. I'm surprised the hotel hasn't negotiated with them to tone down their somewhat agressive selling techniques.",neutral,i went here just before christmas with friend it a lovely hotel good room nice food good location although sea swimming a bit rough gym swimming pool jacuzzi free wifi all the trapping but the service just didnt match up it wa very pleasant all the staff were extemely nice but poor english sloppy service long wait when ordering anything so although id recommend it i do hope that heritance take some time and trouble to train the staff properly it a great hotel but the service let it down biggest black mark wa the very vocal hawker on the beach they stay just on the hotel boundary and shout and harass the guest trying to sell thing not pleasant at all and really ruin what would otherwise be a restful and relaxing place im surprised the hotel hasnt negotiated with them to tone down their somewhat agressive selling technique,886,154,4.759740259740259,3,0.9652,0.218,0.1,0.682,0.16153439153439153,0.5822751322751324
"I have just returned from a one week stay at this hotel. The day of my arrival was Independence Day and therefore preparation for celebrations were in full swing, funnily I immediately felt part of the hotel. The staff were lovely, helpful, calm and polite even when I was a bit fraught with things not exactly working out as planned from my travel company. Lazy days on the beach were marred by enthusiastic beach vendors, however with the help of a German guest I managed to negotiate a good price for a silk scarf having told myself ""I am most certainly not going to buy anything from them!"" Sri Lankans are welcoming people and not all are after your money, although I did find the tipping to the hotel staff obligatory which got embarrassing, if not down right annoying one guy round the pool seemed to want tipping to speak to me! Yet another saved my sunbed all morning for only a smile. On my last morning my pick up time was some unearthly early morning hour, but the kitchen staff managed to lay on my own personal buffet breakfast AND I received a breakfast picnic to take with me to the airport. Food was mediocre but good a selection at breakfast, dinner with my half board was a bit ""breakfast warmed up"" with some dishes, although as a vegetarian my tastes were well catered for plus an offer of my personal selection from the chef. A Fawlty moment one evening when I asked for a black coffee to complete the meal. I was told ""Coffee off, no more coffee, sorry coffee is finished"" err is this a hotel? this was rectified when a member of the waiting staff later turned up with my coffee. It needs more polish. Little things like a stain on the table cloth, cloudy glasses, no hair conditioner, a chip on the bathroom mug,a stain on the net curtains in my room and the corridor to the room looked more ""seaside guest house"". They were improving the walls on the stairs of the hotel with stencilling. A warning, I hit my head on a metal plank balanced precariously between the bannisters where the ""artist"" stood. Health and Safety in the UK would have closed it down. I did mention it and the reception staff thanked me for drawing it to their attention. The plank remained. The hotel was over all quiet and the music went on till only 10.30pm I did like an early night but the music was pleasant enough despite hearing it in my room and as I say it was only to 10.30pm. The hotel did seem to regulate conferences/weddings to noise minimum and respect to their guests. It might pass for a 4 star only Sri Lankan style but it was not 5 star. Too many rude Russians but this is not a hotel issue just a way of life on holiday now.",negative,i have just returned from a one week stay at this hotel the day of my arrival wa independence day and therefore preparation for celebration were in full swing funnily i immediately felt part of the hotel the staff were lovely helpful calm and polite even when i wa a bit fraught with thing not exactly working out a planned from my travel company lazy day on the beach were marred by enthusiastic beach vendor however with the help of a german guest i managed to negotiate a good price for a silk scarf having told myself i am most certainly not going to buy anything from them sri lankans are welcoming people and not all are after your money although i did find the tipping to the hotel staff obligatory which got embarrassing if not down right annoying one guy round the pool seemed to want tipping to speak to me yet another saved my sunbed all morning for only a smile on my last morning my pick up time wa some unearthly early morning hour but the kitchen staff managed to lay on my own personal buffet breakfast and i received a breakfast picnic to take with me to the airport food wa mediocre but good a selection at breakfast dinner with my half board wa a bit breakfast warmed up with some dish although a a vegetarian my taste were well catered for plus an offer of my personal selection from the chef a fawlty moment one evening when i asked for a black coffee to complete the meal i wa told coffee off no more coffee sorry coffee is finished err is this a hotel this wa rectified when a member of the waiting staff later turned up with my coffee it need more polish little thing like a stain on the table cloth cloudy glass no hair conditioner a chip on the bathroom muga stain on the net curtain in my room and the corridor to the room looked more seaside guest house they were improving the wall on the stair of the hotel with stencilling a warning i hit my head on a metal plank balanced precariously between the bannister where the artist stood health and safety in the uk would have closed it down i did mention it and the reception staff thanked me for drawing it to their attention the plank remained the hotel wa over all quiet and the music went on till only pm i did like an early night but the music wa pleasant enough despite hearing it in my room and a i say it wa only to pm the hotel did seem to regulate conferencesweddings to noise minimum and respect to their guest it might pas for a star only sri lankan style but it wa not star too many rude russian but this is not a hotel issue just a way of life on holiday now,2642,492,4.371951219512195,1,0.9899,0.115,0.033,0.852,0.08470017636684306,0.5389241622574956

I went to this hotel after 15 years. It was our Annual Company Staff trip. Rooms were ample and well kept. Very comfortable bed and suiting lightings. Food was to be amazed not so good. Everything was lacking something and not the best food ever surprisingly. Service wasn't up to the standard. I had to wait more than ten minutes after requesting cutlery for dinner. And requesting hot water took more than ever. At breakfast I had to eat without a serviette because Steward never showed up. Sometimes I had to yell at them in order to get water. This type of service is never expected from a five star rated hotel. The night club was so much fun. The other terrible fact about the hotel was they switch off the lights in the corridors and we had to assist ourselves with a torch in order to find the room. Some of my friends had mistakenly tapped the wrong room. I mean this is a hotel which operates 24/7 and why do they wanna switch off the lights?

"I want to share my experience (no so good) at The Heritance Hotel Anugila. I along with my 2 sisters had made a booking for the 3 of us for 2 nights 17th and 18th August 2017 at The Heritance hotel Anugula. We checked-in the hotel on 17th Evening and were smoothly escorted to our room number 224. 1- On reaching the room we noticed that the floor was a little wet and asked for it to be cleaned with a delay of 5-10 minutes the floor was cleaned. 2- Tired of all the travel throughout the day, we thought of making some tea/coffee in the room, just to find that there were only 2 of all the things in the room. 2 cups, 2 glasses, 2 spoons etc. (for a room booked for 3). Why would the arrangements be for 2 when the booking is for 3??? 3- The electric kettle was placed in a cupboard which had no plug points. we had to shift the kettle to some other table to actually use it. But again to my surprise, the electric kettle plug (Flat pin) and the plug point (Round ones) in the room did not match. 4- My sister sat on the third bed to find out that the bed was actually not stable. If you sit on one side of it, it would lift up from the other. 5- We called up the rooms service for the above 3 points (2,3 and 4), but to my disappointment they could not have been slower. When you have a 5 star facility I would expect the staff to know English. The room service were not able to understand our plain English!! The room service addressed the plug problem, we made tea, and one of us had tea in a glass tumbler as there were only 3 cups in the room! 6- I went for a swim in the evening and came back to my room to take a shower. I land up in the bathroom to find out that there is no Shampoo or conditioner in the room!!! I call up the reception for the same and they tell me they will send it to my room. I wait for almost 15 mins no hear no knock on my door. In the end I had to take a shower without a shampoo or conditioner. 7- At dinner that night, my sisters were a little disappointed as there were not much veg options (they both are vegetarians). The chef was there taking feedback and my sisters told him the same. The next morning we were to go for an early whale watching trip and had to leave at 5.30 AM. We had already asked the reception to pack our breakfast. Previous night, while talking to the chef, my sisters told him that we would be leaving early and to pack good breakfast for 3 (2 veg (for my sisters) and 1 non veg (for me)). We woke up and were leaving for the trip. The reception handed over our breakfast nicely packed. We opened the packets around 10AM on our way back from the trip to find out 3 non-beg meals!!!!! My sisters could not have breakfast that morning, thanks to the chef’s goof-up! 8- We reached our room, called up the reception for shampoo and conditioner (Which were still not there in the room). The room service comes to the room with an unlabelled bottle and said that was shampoo. I asked for a hair conditioner and I am still in shock that he did not know what that was!! I explained what that was, and he said that they do not have a hair conditioner available!!! Believe me I am in shock as I write it!! 9- The day went on, we did not want to spoil our mood as we were on a 3 sisters vacation! But the next morning when we woke up, we found out that the entire room was dripping of water (see pictures attached). The room had always been wet throughout our stay (as found on check-in) but it started dripping literally next morning. We had our luggage placed on the table above which the ceiling was dripping! All our clothes were wet! We had to quickly move the luggage from there to the beds. And then there was no place to sit. I called up the room service to show them that, to hear a reply that we should not have the window open. We were in a sea facing room and were there to enjoy the sea, not to seal ourselves up in an AC room. That we do anyway at our offices when we are not on vacation. Why would you be in a sea facing room and not have the balcony or windows open?? I have not seen a beach side 5 star property of not having slippers or bathrobes in the room. I do not think these facilities should be provided on request. Isn’t it obvious that on a beach side resort the guests will go to the beach (or swimming pool) and would need slippers? Why should they have to ask for it?? Again still in shock - No conditioner!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! There are no plug points next to the bed!!!!! only 1 plug point far away fromt he bed. No multi-plugs available in the room. You have to call room service for that as well! We were in Sri-Lanka for a 7 day trip, stayed in all 4 star resorts. We wanted our last 2 days to be special and relaxing and hence we chose a 5 star. Our experience in all 4 star places was far better than these 2 last days!

"We arrived at the Heritance Ahungalla at 9pm yesterday evening after a long journey from the States. We were told that the rooms we had booked and paid for were no longer available. This is a small boutique style hotel. They solution was to send us next door to a large all inclusive party resort We contacted Agoda who booked the room and failed to notify us it was cancelled. They offered a 15% discount. Big deal, we had already lost our first day of a three day visit getting bounced around and treated like a bad disease. Escalation within Agoda was requested but ignored.

"We checked in on New Year's eve to see 2012 in. We'd booked a triple room and paid a 50% advance at the head office at Aitken Sence Colombo, which was mandatory due to the New Year's eve rush. But the room was not ready at check- in and we had to wait quite awhile. We were given large half glasses (yeah half!) of a local fresh juice but realised later that other check in guests were given moist towels as well. Finally, we were taken into a 2 roomed suite that had been furnished for only two persons. We had to look for a room boy to tip him to bring in a third bed, third set of towels etc.etc. Our so-called luxury room was far from that - the 'fridge didn't work, the TV was badly tuned, the safety deposit locker malfunctioned, one bedside light didn't work.. Due to the malfunctioning fridge we were not even able to break a bottle of bubbly.. (now who likes warm champagne) - (BTW check the spelling of 'champagne' in the GM's letter of welcome - here my sex was wrong - I was titled as 'Mr' We had tipped the check-in steward - a name like Achila - do avoid this scoundrel at all costs! - generously to get us a table for the gala dinner, but he was nowhere to be seen. We looked into the area four times, to ensure that we had a table, but nothing had been set up for us. Finally, we were told to come down for dinner and that we would then get our table. No table when we arrived for dinner. We were then told to sit at another table. Five minutes later the same steward - named Mudalige - said he was sorry but the table had been booked by somebody else!!- I refused to get up! Our table had no lamp of decor etc like the other tables and after telling just about every waiter passing by, we got some of these things over 1 1/2 hours later!! The next day at breakfast, after standing in line for awhile, I requested a warm item from a serving chef, I was told by him that he had to serve over 50 guests at that time (so what?!). Finally, the time to depart arrived, and we breathed a sign of relief. We were all women but even the final receipt was titled 'Me & Mrs"". When I got to my car in the hotel car park I found parts of it strewn about - it had been damaged by a tour operator who had claimed that I had been blocking him! Now this was a clearly designated hotel parking space which should have been so designed not to inconvenienced other vehicles. The hotel couldn't even inform the person to remove my vehicle (they didn't even know the name or company of the vandal) because it keeps no records of guest vehicles - rather a security threat in a country just recovering from civil strife, methinks.... Having said this, the general manager and front office manager were extremely nice and tried to compensate for our traumatic experience by even offering us an extra night on the house, but we had to get back to our families on new years day - so we were given a discount on the room rate, cakes and chocolates to forget our troubles.. The room rate for this unforgettable experience was well over $ 400 and unforgettable experience it certainly was! It will be a loooong time before we recover from the trauma of our stay at Heritance Ahungalla.

"On arrival, when Reception was informed we'd been confirmed Room 333, we were told that our room would not be ready for another 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, we were then told that it would not be ready for another few hours as it's a luxury room & will take that long to clean. When we asked if this was because the previous occupants checked out late, we were told they didn't know, and when pressed, they admitted that was the reason. When we said that shouldn't have happened as the room was booked, & previous occupants should not be allowed to check out late, they offered us a ""transit room, free of charge"" until the room we had booked (which was more expensive than this ""transit room"" was ready. How could they possibly think we would be happy with a ""transit room"", which was cheaper & more basic than the one we had booked & put up with the inconvenience involved in changing rooms? When we said we weren't happy with this & insisted on talking to the Manager, he finally turned up some time later & said the previous occupants couldn't be vacated on time as they were elderly & disabled, but they would have four cleaners clean the room & it would be ready in 30 mins. Finally, we had access to the room we booked at 3.45pm (although, we should have had the room at 2pm), but we still had to wait another 15 minutes (i.e. until 4pm) for our luggage, which had been sent to the cheaper ""transit room""& had to be brought back. So, they broke their contract. A room we should have had at 2pm, was only given to us at 4pm (2 hours later). We later discovered that the previous occupants were not elderly at all.

"We stayed here for 3 nights at the end of our touring holiday. Although we had a room with a beach view it was above the bar area - and each evening we had to endure really loud really awful karaoke type music. Luckily this only went on until just past 11 but it sure wasn't the peaceful, relaxing stay we had anticipated. We asked to change rooms but were told it was not possible. The food was luke warm and the service, particularly for drinks, was slow. We did enjoy time spent around the quieter of the 2 pools and the beach was only a short stroll away. There were touts but we got used to them, it's a third world country after all. It wasn't a disastrous stay by any means but I would describe it as more of a 3 star than it's supposed status of 5 star - so it's expensive for what you get. Be warned - it's about 3-4 hours drive from the airport.",neutral,we stayed here for night at the end of our touring holiday although we had a room with a beach view it wa above the bar area and each evening we had to endure really loud really awful karaoke type music luckily this only went on until just past but it sure wasnt the peaceful relaxing stay we had anticipated we asked to change room but were told it wa not possible the food wa luke warm and the service particularly for drink wa slow we did enjoy time spent around the quieter of the pool and the beach wa only a short stroll away there were tout but we got used to them it a third world country after all it wasnt a disastrous stay by any mean but i would describe it a more of a star than it supposed status of star so it expensive for what you get be warned it about hour drive from the airport,855,170,4.035294117647059,-2,0.7056,0.094,0.068,0.838,0.0,0.5802777777777778
"First of the good: The people and the rooms are great. Very helpful and kind staff. Rooms have a great view. The bad: Co-ordination of our trip was very poor. We got in very late and realized that they only booked us in 1 room when our reservation said 2 rooms. They ended up finding a room for my wife and I, but it had 2 twin beds rather than a king/queen. Same goes for my parents room. Food: Food was average at best. At a 5 (or 4 star) property, you expect the food to be excellent as you end up spending a lot of time just hanging out at the property rather than running around from place to place. Us being vegetarians was especially hard. We had the same 3-4 dishes to pick from. Most of them even seemed to be served from the meal before. The chef told us that we should have informed them of our dietary restrictions. However, from a 5 star resort, you expect them to follow up with you prior to your visit or during reservation, asking you of these things. Nothing of the sort happened. Of course, if they had followed up prior, the mix up with the room would not have happened either. In addition, if they followed up, they would've known that my father is disabled and would have found a room closer to the elevator.... I can't really recommend this property for the price we paid.",neutral,first of the good the people and the room are great very helpful and kind staff room have a great view the bad coordination of our trip wa very poor we got in very late and realized that they only booked u in room when our reservation said room they ended up finding a room for my wife and i but it had twin bed rather than a kingqueen same go for my parent room food food wa average at best at a or star property you expect the food to be excellent a you end up spending a lot of time just hanging out at the property rather than running around from place to place u being vegetarian wa especially hard we had the same dish to pick from most of them even seemed to be served from the meal before the chef told u that we should have informed them of our dietary restriction however from a star resort you expect them to follow up with you prior to your visit or during reservation asking you of these thing nothing of the sort happened of course if they had followed up prior the mix up with the room would not have happened either in addition if they followed up they wouldve known that my father is disabled and would have found a room closer to the elevator i cant really recommend this property for the price we paid,1294,247,4.242914979757085,2,0.93,0.083,0.035,0.881,0.16698412698412696,0.5147619047619048

"Ignored by the bell boys at arrival and left for half an hour in a dingy bar to await our room. Despite a choice of only 3 welcome drinks, the barman managed to get one of the two wrong !! Eventually given a room which was right on the beach, but seemed to be the only room in the hotel without net curtains, so no privacy at all. We then noticed that the door lock was hanging off so called maintenance. While waiting for them, we discovered a jammed cupboard (so no access to safe), a poky, smelly bathroom and a TV with no reception. Eventually went back to reception (after unconvincing lock fix) and demanded a new room which we were given after another hour's wait. It was better, although lighting was poor. Cleaning was haphazard, towels were often taken but not replaced and there were no insect sprays/mats. Each morning one of the pool boys comes and blasts the pool area with rap music to try to encourage aerobics participants - they should listen to the words one day, which are about 50% expletives and not everyone's taste !! Food was OK but nothing like the Kandalama, another Heritance hotel. Spa was very expensive although treatments were good - watch out for $ prices which mysteriously end up being a lot more in rupees (works out about 140 to the $, not 115). Lots of hassle from beach sellers as well. Overall we were very disappointed as we had such a wonderful time at the Heritance Kandalama in Dambulla and expected the same from this sister hotel.

"It was only because of the hotels staff that my 2 nights stay here from being a horrible one to a very good experience. We checked in very late one evening and were given rooms above the coffee shop grill which meant that the rooms were full of the grill seafood smoke. A few minutes inside the rooms we started feeling like grilled fish ourselves. Upon request for room change we were told that the hotel was full and our request thus denied. Dinner at the coffee shop was a pretty sad affair too. The chicken that we were served was so hard that I am sure if I'd thrown it at a passerby that person would get hurt. After a stroll on the beach when we came to our rooms past midnight we realized that there was no water supply in the rooms due to some maintenance work and that it'd be restored around 2 am. That too did not happen. Our arms full of woes we met the Resident Manager Sampath De Silva and were surprised that he offered no arguments but only an apology. From that point onwards our stay turned into heaven. Mr Sampath offered to change our rooms and the staff went out of their way to be helpful, courteous and friendly.

"We stayed at this hotel for four days and it was the worst hotel experience ever. A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY AND A VERY EXPENSIVE DISASTER!

Make sure you understand what is the worst that could happen to you also if you choose to stay here, because the worst scenario did happen to us. We did not read what the low ratings on Tripadvisor said about the Heritance Ahungalla. We wished we did because so many of these complaints reflect our experience. My friend and I are both seasoned travelers, and have stayed in both five star accommodation and budget ones, all over the world. Given the cost of staying at this hotel, we were both incredibly disappointed and also traumatised during their stay. We felt so uncomfortable and threatened during our stay that we locked ourselves in our hotel room. We have lodged a formal complaint to the travel agency about our stay at the Heritance Ahungalla. Our main complaints are as follows: - Worst service: for the entire duration of the trip, the staff was incredibly rude. There was no ‘hospitality’. The staff pestered us repeatedly for tips, from the receptionist to cleaning staff to waiters. When we made all the complaints listed below to the staff, we were completely ignored and were shouted at. No attempts were made to apologise or to resolve the problems. We were incredibly frustrated by this, and were very close to tears. - Terribly unhygienic: stained bedsheets, dust and mould. Restaurant tableware and cutlery was not cleaned properly and had stains. - Pests: cockroaches, flies and mosquitoes in the bedroom and the bathroom. - Touts: The hotel was full of touts, from the pool to the beach, also pestering us and other guests to buy their goods. At one point, one of the touts even made a completely disgusting sexual advance on my friend! The hotel made no effort to safeguard the safety and/or privacy of their guests. - Food: the food was always lukewarm at best, and/or cold. Food would take at least 45 minutes to arrive. We ended up eating only burgers and fries for the four days that we were there, as it was the only food we felt was safe. For a holiday experience, this was disappointing. It would have been better to have just eaten McDonald’s. - Bad facility condition: The hotel is quite old, and many parts require fixing. A number of sunbeds were broken and completely unusable. We will never stay there again and are warning everyone who visits Sri Lanka to avoid this place. If you plan on staying there, at least read both the good and bad reviews to decide for yourself. There is a higher risk staying at this hotel, because of its location. It is incredibly far away from Colombo and any other properties, so if you arrive here and the hotel is a complete disappointment, there is no other property that you can escape to. BEWARE!",negative,we stayed at this hotel for four day and it wa the worst hotel experience ever a complete waste of money and a very expensive disaster i recommend reading the lowest review for this hotel before you book there is a real discrepancy between the nightmare review and those that are praising this hotel make sure you understand what is the worst that could happen to you also if you choose to stay here because the worst scenario did happen to u we did not read what the low rating on tripadvisor said about the heritance ahungalla we wished we did because so many of these complaint reflect our experience my friend and i are both seasoned traveler and have stayed in both five star accommodation and budget one all over the world given the cost of staying at this hotel we were both incredibly disappointed and also traumatised during their stay we felt so uncomfortable and threatened during our stay that we locked ourselves in our hotel room we have lodged a formal complaint to the travel agency about our stay at the heritance ahungalla our main complaint are a follows worst service for the entire duration of the trip the staff wa incredibly rude there wa no hospitality the staff pestered u repeatedly for tip from the receptionist to cleaning staff to waiter when we made all the complaint listed below to the staff we were completely ignored and were shouted at no attempt were made to apologise or to resolve the problem we were incredibly frustrated by this and were very close to tear terribly unhygienic stained bedsheets dust and mould restaurant tableware and cutlery wa not cleaned properly and had stain pest cockroach fly and mosquito in the bedroom and the bathroom tout the hotel wa full of tout from the pool to the beach also pestering u and other guest to buy their good at one point one of the tout even made a completely disgusting sexual advance on my friend the hotel made no effort to safeguard the safety andor privacy of their guest food the food wa always lukewarm at best andor cold food would take at least minute to arrive we ended up eating only burger and fry for the four day that we were there a it wa the only food we felt wa safe for a holiday experience this wa disappointing it would have been better to have just eaten mcdonalds bad facility condition the hotel is quite old and many part require fixing a number of sunbeds were broken and completely unusable we will never stay there again and are warning everyone who visit sri lanka to avoid this place if you plan on staying there at least read both the good and bad review to decide for yourself there is a higher risk staying at this hotel because of it location it is incredibly far away from colombo and any other property so if you arrive here and the hotel is a complete disappointment there is no other property that you can escape to beware,2981,524,4.690839694656488,-4,-0.9965,0.07,0.179,0.751,-0.14474914965986396,0.5734467120181405

Disrespectful and unfriendly front office manager and staff. From the time I arrived to the lobby. Wasnt provided a welcome drink and towel while other non solo travelers were attended too.

Tried to over charge me for meals and came up with some nonsense explanation which has nothing to do with the guest blaiming the head office. when i made a noise regarding it so other guests could hear he asked me what i want just to shut me up.

"Having read some fantastic reviews of this hotel, we arrived with high expectations. Twice prior to arrival we had reqested a room with a sea view and a double bed. On arrival however we were asked if we wanted to upgrade before even seeing the room, therefore, it came as no suprise that we had neither a sea view nor a double bed as requested. Now I appreciate the hotel was very busy over the Sri Lankan New Year however we had booked well in advance and were assured that within two days we would be moved, which did not materialise despite constant pleas, until day 7 of 10! Agreed the hotel was very clean and in a fantastic location, however, if you are looking for something intimate and romantic this is not the place for you.

However, the staff in the bar/ restaurant area are extremely helpful. I would definitely recommend to take their Romantic Dinner Set up on the beach which is extremely unique and a great menu. The peak of the hotel is the main swimming pool as it really is the focal point of the hotel. The pit of our stay is that we were not informed about anything during check in such as useful information like: you have the choice of enjoying your breakfast in your hotel room or the buffet concept restaurant & coffee and tea are complimentary during your stay (including in room dining orders!!!). All these points are great highlights which were not informed to us and we only found out by asking proactively asking questions or having the lovely surprise of not being charge for breakfast by in room dining. We really want to thank Front Desk Assistant Manager, Kansu (I think that's his name!) who looked after us during our stay and even surprised us by placing a happy anniversary cake in our suite.

"In terms of service, this is the worst experience we've had so far :D. I travelled through over 40 countries, and nowhere did I see the personnel so chilled - but not in a good way :) Restaurant & bar team easily forgets your order, and even when they don't, you can wait for a simple coffee in a bar with 2 tables occupied for over 0.5 hour. They graciously add someone else's drinks to your bill (8 glasses of wine instead of actual 2? easy!) Moreover, some of them literally beg for tips, and when you tip them, it doesn't mean the service becomes any better. I had a birthday on the first night of our stay, but the reception forgot to inform the restaurant, so we went to ask for a candle. On the same evening we asked for refill of water, coffee and tea in the room (we didn't get a refill on that day, so we called the reception to ask for it as they themselves advised us to do), but instead a boy came with a brewed coffee charged extra... The room keys didn't work on one day, so we had to go all the way back to the reception to then be escorted back to the room by the maintenance guy who spent quite some time fixing the issue. Oh, and as for maintenance, you simply can't be left in peace here - e.g., laundry man barbarically opens your door even with the DND sign on... Last but not least, on arrival, my bank card didn't work, while on the check-out it did. Quite strange. Luckily we had another card. Will I recommend this hotel? Not really. Maybe only for 1-night stay to enjoy the beauty of nature. But if you want nice service and a proper care you would expect for this price, avoid this place. :)",negative,in term of service this is the worst experience weve had so far d i travelled through over country and nowhere did i see the personnel so chilled but not in a good way restaurant bar team easily forgets your order and even when they dont you can wait for a simple coffee in a bar with table occupied for over hour they graciously add someone elses drink to your bill glass of wine instead of actual easy moreover some of them literally beg for tip and when you tip them it doesnt mean the service becomes any better i had a birthday on the first night of our stay but the reception forgot to inform the restaurant so we went to ask for a candle on the same evening we asked for refill of water coffee and tea in the room we didnt get a refill on that day so we called the reception to ask for it a they themselves advised u to do but instead a boy came with a brewed coffee charged extra the room key didnt work on one day so we had to go all the way back to the reception to then be escorted back to the room by the maintenance guy who spent quite some time fixing the issue oh and a for maintenance you simply cant be left in peace here eg laundry man barbarically open your door even with the dnd sign on last but not least on arrival my bank card didnt work while on the checkout it did quite strange luckily we had another card will i recommend this hotel not really maybe only for night stay to enjoy the beauty of nature but if you want nice service and a proper care you would expect for this price avoid this place,1619,314,4.159235668789809,1,0.9947,0.165,0.036,0.799,0.12762345679012344,0.4748015873015872

"The hotel is very tired. Everything in my room worked, but everything was a little shabby and shabby - both the furniture and the plumbing. And even the ponds with lotuses and carp behind the hotel - if they were at least cleaned, it would be a completely different feeling. The food is beyond praise. There wasn’t much to eat around anyway, but in the hotel - if you take national cuisine - huge portions and very tasty. The staff tries to solve your problems, but not quickly. The cleaning is lousy, whether you leave a tip or not, it doesn’t affect the amount of sand on the floor. The hotel always had free sun loungers, which the staff will put where you need them upon request. There are a lot of different animals on the territory - monitor lizards, palm squirrels, funny birds. And also a skinny cat and two very cute dogs (the latter, however, were chased by the staff). Monkeys walk on the roofs, but they are also chased, it is not so easy to see them. The beach is public, but given the location it is mostly deserted.

"Pointless in requesting any type of room beforehand. It didn&#39;t happen for us! As soon as we entered our room, there was a terrible smell of damp. On our balcony there was a white powder. I cleaned this up, and there it was again. It turned out they were decorating the room upstairs, and the &quot;powder&quot; was paint being rubbed down. You couldn&#39;t sit on the balcony without it getting on your clothes, and the stench in the room was really bad. In fairness, they said we could change room. I went to check and there was no smell or powder, and the room was prepared apart from bed and bathroom linen, but still they said it would not be ready for 24 hours. We then went for dinner around 9.00 pm. Unfortunately, the food had obviously been there since there since the start, and was either &quot;scrapings&quot; or what no one else wanted. Good nights sleep, then we both became I&#39;ll. I just had moderate sickness and diahorrea. My partner had diahorrea , but really, really bad vomiting. It lasted 15 hours, before he finally settled. Towards the end of this we were advised our new room was ready. I said how we sick we were. Probably, a language problem, but they offered us room service!!! The last thing we needed was food - we couldn&#39;t keep anything down. We couldn&#39;t move room - we were in bed, intermittently, using the bathroom.. By the following day, the powder has stopped appearing (later found out they had stopped rubbing down) and we kind of got used to the stench, and couldn&#39;t face packing up again and moving for 3 nights. _x000D_ The beach location is beautiful. The gardens are lovely. Our balcony view was lovely. _x000D_ The rooms are smelly and need updating(maybe why we got the powder). . I didn&#39;t enjoy the food, probably because we were ill, but it was varied, and maybe our sickness had nothing to do with it, who knows.

"Have just returned from 2 weeks at the Heritance and overall it was a disappointing experience, primarily because the service was so mixed, ranging from good, to indifferent, to frankly poor. My wife and I travelled with our 13 year old son, and we stayed in 2 adjacent luxury rooms, which were slightly tired, but extremely spacious, and thoroughly cleaned every day. A word of warning to anyone travelling with younger children, we had made 3 advance requests via our Tour Operator ""Kuoni"", for inter connecting rooms. We received no reply, and were only advised on arrival that the hotel has no interconnecting rooms. The 2 hotel pools are large and well maintained, one offering some limited organised activities and the other residents' pool offering a quieter option. The hotel and grounds are spacious, and even though the hotel was fully occupied for part of our stay, it never felt over crowded. We had opted for bed and breakfast, so didn't experience the buffet, all inclusive option. However a few of our fellow guests did and commented that the food was good quality, but repetitive if staying for 2 weeks. We mainly ate in the Coffee Shop restaurant where the food was good, and given a supposed 5 star hotel, we thought the prices were reasonable. Dining out options in the village of Ahungalla are non existent. If you walk out of the hotel complex, you are quickly surrounded by several locals, offering TukTuk rides, boat safaris, and numerous trips. They are persistent but never threatening, and several firm "" no thank you"" will usually see them retreat. The village does have a pharmacy and a bank. If you are cashing travellers cheques, it is worth the 5 minute stroll to the bank as it offers a significantly better exchange rate than the hotel. For dining out you need to get a taxi or a TukTuk to Bentota or else to HIkkaduwa. Bentota has several hotels and is 20 minutes in a taxi or about 25/30 minutes in a TukTuk. The drivers will wait for you and negotiate a return trip price. A hotel taxi was about £20 for a return trip, with the tuktuks costing about half of that. The best restaurant we found was the Golden Grill, good for curries and seafood. Dinner for 3 people with beer and soft drinks was typically £30 to £40 in total. Main frustration came with the inconsistent service in the hotel. At breakfast, there was a great range of food, and all well presented, and plenty of staff on hand. Unfortunately it wasn't unusual for 3 different waiters to approach you to ask whether we wanted tea or coffee, but then none of them would get round to serving it. The pool attendants are helpful but want tipping continually and the room cleaners changed several times and all made subtle overtures for tips. Reception staff were always smiling, but poorly trained and inefficient with simple requests having to be made several times before anything got done. After the first week we found a great guy working reception and just made sure we dealt with him. Some lovely staff serving drinks around the pool, always friendly and helpful. Wandering onto the beach is spoilt because the locals will lie in wait and then follow you round trying to sell you gouges or trips. They will ask your name and if you give it, they will stand at the edge of the hotel property calling to you while you try and relax on your sun bed. Again they aren't threatening in any way, just persistent and something of a pain. Just keep saying ""no thank you"" and they will eventually give up ! Overall, the Heritance is nice but dated hotel, but represents pretty reasonable value for what it is. The location is isolated but the grounds and pools are good, and the rooms are fine. It has the potential to offer a relaxed, get away from it all style resort, IF the management could get their act together and get the service to a consistently efficient level.",negative,have just returned from week at the heritance and overall it wa a disappointing experience primarily because the service wa so mixed ranging from good to indifferent to frankly poor my wife and i travelled with our year old son and we stayed in adjacent luxury room which were slightly tired but extremely spacious and thoroughly cleaned every day a word of warning to anyone travelling with younger child we had made advance request via our tour operator kuoni for inter connecting room we received no reply and were only advised on arrival that the hotel ha no interconnecting room the hotel pool are large and well maintained one offering some limited organised activity and the other resident pool offering a quieter option the hotel and ground are spacious and even though the hotel wa fully occupied for part of our stay it never felt over crowded we had opted for bed and breakfast so didnt experience the buffet all inclusive option however a few of our fellow guest did and commented that the food wa good quality but repetitive if staying for week we mainly ate in the coffee shop restaurant where the food wa good and given a supposed star hotel we thought the price were reasonable dining out option in the village of ahungalla are non existent if you walk out of the hotel complex you are quickly surrounded by several local offering tuktuk ride boat safari and numerous trip they are persistent but never threatening and several firm no thank you will usually see them retreat the village doe have a pharmacy and a bank if you are cashing traveller cheque it is worth the minute stroll to the bank a it offer a significantly better exchange rate than the hotel for dining out you need to get a taxi or a tuktuk to bentota or else to hikkaduwa bentota ha several hotel and is minute in a taxi or about minute in a tuktuk the driver will wait for you and negotiate a return trip price a hotel taxi wa about for a return trip with the tuktuks costing about half of that the best restaurant we found wa the golden grill good for curry and seafood dinner for people with beer and soft drink wa typically to in total main frustration came with the inconsistent service in the hotel at breakfast there wa a great range of food and all well presented and plenty of staff on hand unfortunately it wasnt unusual for different waiter to approach you to ask whether we wanted tea or coffee but then none of them would get round to serving it the pool attendant are helpful but want tipping continually and the room cleaner changed several time and all made subtle overture for tip reception staff were always smiling but poorly trained and inefficient with simple request having to be made several time before anything got done after the first week we found a great guy working reception and just made sure we dealt with him some lovely staff serving drink around the pool always friendly and helpful wandering onto the beach is spoilt because the local will lie in wait and then follow you round trying to sell you gouge or trip they will ask your name and if you give it they will stand at the edge of the hotel property calling to you while you try and relax on your sun bed again they arent threatening in any way just persistent and something of a pain just keep saying no thank you and they will eventually give up overall the heritance is nice but dated hotel but represents pretty reasonable value for what it is the location is isolated but the ground and pool are good and the room are fine it ha the potential to offer a relaxed get away from it all style resort if the management could get their act together and get the service to a consistently efficient level,3864,685,4.642335766423358,5,0.9978,0.144,0.049,0.808,0.12038926681783825,0.45887503149407916

"It's what you don't see in the glossy photos and marketing blurb, but step one metre outside the hotel grounds (front/roadside or back/beachside) and you'll immediately be surrounded by local touts, who draw you into conversation with general chit-chat (Where are you from? How long are you staying?) before swiftly moving on to the HARD SELL (for tours, tuktuks, souvenirs, restaurants, etc), or muscling in on trying to carry your shopping and gathering around when you get your change in the hope of receiving some cash. In short, it doesn't make you feel like a human being; more like a walking Rupee or Dollar bill waiting to get rinsed. I am expecting the mandatory response from the hotel manager (does he really write these Trip Advisor responses?!), saying the hotel is working with the touts to improve the experience for guests... if this is true (and it seems to have been ongoing for some time), it simply is not working. A cynic would suggest the touts benefit the hotel in scaring guests into only using the hotel's services. We did this initially - a 9km taxi trip was a set hotel price of $27 return, compared to £2.50 single in a tuktuk. And the hotel taxi driver was hell-bent on taking us to a turtle hatchery, temple, Ayurveda centre, tea shop, etc. instead of where we had actually asked to go, which was exasperating. As for the hotel itself, one you get beyond the wow factor of the pools, the hotel rooms are comfortable and functional, serviced by attentive housekeeping staff.

"We stayed one night in February 2022 at Heritance Ahungalla. The room was very spacious and clean. We requested a quiet room and the hotel gave us a room which is far from the central pool area, facing the second pool. It was indeed very quiet. The welcome fruit was nice touch. The staff there are very nice and you can ask all kinds of questions. Buffet for dinner and breakfast had both good selection. You can taste authentic Sri Lankan food there although there are many western dishes. We sat in the garden at the dinner as it was quieter. The beach is wonderful and great place to watch sunset. The pool in the center was bit clouded but the second pool was not soo bad.

"We booked our 2 day stay after reading the good reviews but were a bit unsure if we would get the same watered down treatment we received in a hotel in Sri Lanka which had good reviews from foreign tourists and where we stayed last year. Although living in Australia for 22 years we do not exactly have a ""foreign"" accent, having been born in Sri Lanka we speak the local language which gives us away to the local staff who generally love to pamper the foreign tourists only. What impressed us in this hotel was that the staff made no distinction between the local tourists and the visitors from overseas, and we were well looked after from the time we arrived. Checking in was very friendly, no standing at the reception, but a staff member escorted us to a sitting area and we were offered a choice of freshly squeezed fruit juice. While we enjoyed our complimentary wood apple juice, we were checked in by the staff member. After we finished our drink, we were actually escorted to our room by this staff member who conversed with us in perfect English and told us about the hotel amenities. We had booked a luxury room with balcony and ocean view, and the room was very comfortable. We enjoyed the view from our balcony usually after waking up in the morning, sipping a cup of tea before heading down to the restaurant for breakfast. The food was really good, the restaurant staff smiled as they approached us. We were even asked to let them know if there was anything we would like to have that was not in the menu, and they did actually oblige with my wife's request for grilled seer fish on Kebab night. We were hoping for a quiet relaxed stay during the middle of the week away from busy Colombo where we had spent most of our Sri Lankan holiday, and we had exactly that. The only thing that wasn't to our liking was the persistence of the hawkers on the beach. My wife bought a sarong that looked quite nice from one of them, however this appeared to be a mistake because that enticed the rest of them to keep following us although we very firmly told them we were not interested in buying something from each one of them. Probably there was nothing much the hotel could do about them. Just one other thing and this is about the bathroom. This was very spacious and we liked it very much, however, the louvered blind on the glass wall adjacent to the bath tub wouldn't shut properly. Not quite sure if this is a deliberate gesture by the management to promote intimacy between couples using this room!",neutral,we booked our day stay after reading the good review but were a bit unsure if we would get the same watered down treatment we received in a hotel in sri lanka which had good review from foreign tourist and where we stayed last year although living in australia for year we do not exactly have a foreign accent having been born in sri lanka we speak the local language which give u away to the local staff who generally love to pamper the foreign tourist only what impressed u in this hotel wa that the staff made no distinction between the local tourist and the visitor from overseas and we were well looked after from the time we arrived checking in wa very friendly no standing at the reception but a staff member escorted u to a sitting area and we were offered a choice of freshly squeezed fruit juice while we enjoyed our complimentary wood apple juice we were checked in by the staff member after we finished our drink we were actually escorted to our room by this staff member who conversed with u in perfect english and told u about the hotel amenity we had booked a luxury room with balcony and ocean view and the room wa very comfortable we enjoyed the view from our balcony usually after waking up in the morning sipping a cup of tea before heading down to the restaurant for breakfast the food wa really good the restaurant staff smiled a they approached u we were even asked to let them know if there wa anything we would like to have that wa not in the menu and they did actually oblige with my wife request for grilled seer fish on kebab night we were hoping for a quiet relaxed stay during the middle of the week away from busy colombo where we had spent most of our sri lankan holiday and we had exactly that the only thing that wasnt to our liking wa the persistence of the hawker on the beach my wife bought a sarong that looked quite nice from one of them however this appeared to be a mistake because that enticed the rest of them to keep following u although we very firmly told them we were not interested in buying something from each one of them probably there wa nothing much the hotel could do about them just one other thing and this is about the bathroom this wa very spacious and we liked it very much however the louvered blind on the glass wall adjacent to the bath tub wouldnt shut properly not quite sure if this is a deliberate gesture by the management to promote intimacy between couple using this room,2510,461,4.4468546637744035,4,0.9965,0.152,0.044,0.804,0.18690393518518514,0.4101736111111112
"I have been to Sri Lanka on many occasions over the last 10 years, often combining work and leisure. My experience of Heritance hotels has been consistently good and Ahungalla was no exception. As with the other Bawa properties I have visited in Sri Lanka (Kandalama and Gallery Cafe for example), Ahungalla is beautifully crafted out of local materials, respects local traditions and also meets the needs of a tropical climate. Ahungalla is also located to provide a stunning view out to the Indian Ocean and several pools from which to enjoy the experience. Perhaps more importantly, the location and architecture are complemented with a warm and extremely professional team of hotel staff. Indeed, in my 30 plus visits to Sri Lanka, only Kandalama has exceeded this hotel in terms of service quality. I co-organised an academic conference at Ahungalla in September 2013, and many of the 142 local and international delegates were equally complimentary of the overall experience, but particularly the architecture and service quality. Unlike many other hotels that host similar events, Ahungalla also benefits from having conference halls somewhat separate from the main hotel. This benefits delegates and hotel guests alike, with the conference proceedings not distracting from the ambience of the hotel. The only slight downside is access. As with much of Sri Lanka, roads are not that good and congestion is common. The Expressway has helped somewhat, but it runs some way from the coast, where most hotels are located. Access from the airport is also difficult, but when the Outer Circular opens, which will bypass Colombo, this will certainly alleviate most of the access difficulties. Despite this and overall, an excellent experience and while I don't visit down South that often, when I do, I shall definitely look to stay at Ahungalla in the future.",positive,i have been to sri lanka on many occasion over the last year often combining work and leisure my experience of heritance hotel ha been consistently good and ahungalla wa no exception a with the other bawa property i have visited in sri lanka kandalama and gallery cafe for example ahungalla is beautifully crafted out of local material respect local tradition and also meet the need of a tropical climate ahungalla is also located to provide a stunning view out to the indian ocean and several pool from which to enjoy the experience perhaps more importantly the location and architecture are complemented with a warm and extremely professional team of hotel staff indeed in my plus visit to sri lanka only kandalama ha exceeded this hotel in term of service quality i coorganised an academic conference at ahungalla in september and many of the local and international delegate were equally complimentary of the overall experience but particularly the architecture and service quality unlike many other hotel that host similar event ahungalla also benefit from having conference hall somewhat separate from the main hotel this benefit delegate and hotel guest alike with the conference proceeding not distracting from the ambience of the hotel the only slight downside is access a with much of sri lanka road are not that good and congestion is common the expressway ha helped somewhat but it run some way from the coast where most hotel are located access from the airport is also difficult but when the outer circular open which will bypass colombo this will certainly alleviate most of the access difficulty despite this and overall an excellent experience and while i dont visit down south that often when i do i shall definitely look to stay at ahungalla in the future,1860,301,5.1827242524916945,3,0.9668,0.11,0.039,0.851,0.1981349206349206,0.42838293650793646
"We booked this hotel for the second part of our holiday by the coast. We were swayed to book this hotel due to the raging reviews on Trip Advisor. Unfortunately it didn’t quite live up to our expectations, especially after leaving the Cinnamon Lodge in Habarana which was advertised to be a lower rating hotel. Our opinions do differ from those on here. The hotel is well known for the architect and so we expected something quite special, as it was also a ‘5’ star resort. On arrival the Loby is attractive as you can see through to a lush swimming pool right onto the sea. The swimming pools were the best bit of this hotel. They are lovely. However, we did find the hotel lacked character and that holiday feel. The architecture was a bit cold and bleak, very concrete, modern and minimalist. Somewhat like a business Hilton hotel which is just not we want on a holiday. The plants around the hotel seemed tired and a bit dead, just outside our room we overlooked a moulding wall where there used to be vegetation climbing up it. The hotel was all very open which was good for a natural breeze, but as soon as the monsoons came this caused a death trap of slippery hallways bars, seat cushions etc. The hotel rooms were nice, again modern but of good quality. The whole place lacked good lighting though. There was also the natural bare plastered look in the hotel bathrooms etc. Not our taste but might appeal to some. I personally like a bright lick of paint or something it bit more luxurious. The hotel did have good facilities if you wanted tennis, ping pong, badminton, spa’s etc. However going onto the beach was slightly annoying due to the persistent locals selling on the beach who would sit on the beach facing the hotel shouting at you to come and look as they will “give you good price”. This is a little off putting but I understand it’s just the way there. We never managed to go onto the beach without having to say no thanks to several different people. The restaurants and entertainment were the biggest disappointment. The food was always nice (wine expensive) but the restaurants lacked atmosphere. The main restaurant had set menus for most of our stay and these were quite pricey. The buffets in that restaurant were a bit better as at least you got more choice. But the restaurant is dark and dreary. No ambience. The a la carte “Cafe”? did have nice food but a bit limited on choice. You also don’t expect to have your a la carte meal in a cafe which lacked again any sort of luxury and really had the ambience slightly above that of a McDonalds. (I am being slightly harsh). The entertainment at the hotel was pretty poor. Sometimes there was a band singing the same songs every night. A cocktail promotion (doesn’t mean it’s a price promotion) with live demonstration. Or simply someone plays an instrument. It was very quiet during our stay so maybe they do more in the main season. We actually spent many of our nights at the Taj hotel in Bentota after this was recommended to us by fellow guests in the same boat as us. I suggest you go there just to get a comparison of what a 5 star hotel should really be like. We had a Chinese in the restaurant there and it was lovely. There buffet meals also had a great deal more ambience. Just grab a tuk tuk to get there. The Refresh restaurant 20 mins away in Hikkaduwa was also lovely. I recommend you stay in Bentota though if you want choice and to be able to walk out the hotel to more restuarants. There is nothing near the Heritance. Having said all that, if you want a quiet, clean relaxing hotel to just unwind sit by the pool and have early nights then it’s a great option. If you are lucky you will see some black monkeys around the hotel. We did get this hotel at a good price so we can’t complain I just believe the ratings on here are misleading. This is not to discredit the staff at the Heritance who were mostly all very helpful and nice people.",neutral,we booked this hotel for the second part of our holiday by the coast we were swayed to book this hotel due to the raging review on trip advisor unfortunately it didnt quite live up to our expectation especially after leaving the cinnamon lodge in habarana which wa advertised to be a lower rating hotel our opinion do differ from those on here the hotel is well known for the architect and so we expected something quite special a it wa also a star resort on arrival the loby is attractive a you can see through to a lush swimming pool right onto the sea the swimming pool were the best bit of this hotel they are lovely however we did find the hotel lacked character and that holiday feel the architecture wa a bit cold and bleak very concrete modern and minimalist somewhat like a business hilton hotel which is just not we want on a holiday the plant around the hotel seemed tired and a bit dead just outside our room we overlooked a moulding wall where there used to be vegetation climbing up it the hotel wa all very open which wa good for a natural breeze but a soon a the monsoon came this caused a death trap of slippery hallway bar seat cushion etc the hotel room were nice again modern but of good quality the whole place lacked good lighting though there wa also the natural bare plastered look in the hotel bathroom etc not our taste but might appeal to some i personally like a bright lick of paint or something it bit more luxurious the hotel did have good facility if you wanted tennis ping pong badminton spa etc however going onto the beach wa slightly annoying due to the persistent local selling on the beach who would sit on the beach facing the hotel shouting at you to come and look a they will give you good price this is a little off putting but i understand it just the way there we never managed to go onto the beach without having to say no thanks to several different people the restaurant and entertainment were the biggest disappointment the food wa always nice wine expensive but the restaurant lacked atmosphere the main restaurant had set menu for most of our stay and these were quite pricey the buffet in that restaurant were a bit better a at least you got more choice but the restaurant is dark and dreary no ambience the a la carte cafe did have nice food but a bit limited on choice you also dont expect to have your a la carte meal in a cafe which lacked again any sort of luxury and really had the ambience slightly above that of a mcdonalds i am being slightly harsh the entertainment at the hotel wa pretty poor sometimes there wa a band singing the same song every night a cocktail promotion doesnt mean it a price promotion with live demonstration or simply someone play an instrument it wa very quiet during our stay so maybe they do more in the main season we actually spent many of our night at the taj hotel in bentota after this wa recommended to u by fellow guest in the same boat a u i suggest you go there just to get a comparison of what a star hotel should really be like we had a chinese in the restaurant there and it wa lovely there buffet meal also had a great deal more ambience just grab a tuk tuk to get there the refresh restaurant min away in hikkaduwa wa also lovely i recommend you stay in bentota though if you want choice and to be able to walk out the hotel to more restuarants there is nothing near the heritance having said all that if you want a quiet clean relaxing hotel to just unwind sit by the pool and have early night then it a great option if you are lucky you will see some black monkey around the hotel we did get this hotel at a good price so we cant complain i just believe the rating on here are misleading this is not to discredit the staff at the heritance who were mostly all very helpful and nice people,3936,726,4.422865013774104,4,0.9978,0.158,0.062,0.78,0.16948026483320602,0.5101134453781514

"The check in was very smooth. Was assigned to a room in the old wing which was very clean. The bathroom was very compact but did have one negative impact since it was party made out of glass and was covered with wooden blinds. This method is not very family friendly when it comes to privacy. The staff was very helpful when changing rooms when we were upgraded to a family suite which was ""AWESOME"" overlooking the GREEN POOL. As usual the Heritance Chain kept up to the standard when it came to the meals where you could find a massive variety and availability. However appreciate if activities for children and catered for since it was quite hard for us to keep the kids occupied and made it boring for them. All we could find was a GHOSTLY kids room. The beach was very clean, and was the only things which kept the children occupied other than the beach. Since the sea was a bit rough kid's couldn't get the full advantage. Last but not least I would like to bring up some thing, the only negative point is you must discuss at the time of check in about the child policy since I was asked about the ages of my kids at the time of check in (which were 6 & 11), in the end at the time of check out (mind you we had a Triple Full Board booking and prior read up of child policy of the hotel) were charged extra for the child, which I see is not professional.
