"Our planned highlight, to the end of our Sri Lankan tour, was a frustrating disappointment.  We arrived tired and sick, hoping for a clean comfortable room and some simple food.  Even though we had booked and paid 6 months earlier, it took a long time to allocate us a room.  The room smelled of mould and mould was easily found in the bathroom. My wife complained, but all the staff could do was find the missing outdoor furniture. At dinner, the first night, we had difficulty finding plain food, that would not aggravate our upset stomachs.  The chef kindly offered to prepare mashed potatoes, peas and grilled chicken, for us, the next night. However, the next day, this offer was undone by management, who declared we had been selected for ""Fine dining"". Fearing this was Sringlish for extra spicy, we gave up and went to bed early, without dinned, which we had already paid for.  At least at checkout, as some compensation, the hotel did not charge for the sandwich and hamburger, we had at the bar.  After my wife presented mouldy toiletries to management, they did offer to change rooms, on the second day; but it was too little too late.  The hotel has an impressive entrance and sea view.  But what good are those when the hotel fails the basics of room and food.",Recreation,our planned highlight to the end of our sri lankan tour wa a frustrating disappointment we arrived tired and sick hoping for a clean comfortable room and some simple food even though we had booked and paid month earlier it took a long time to allocate u a room the room smelled of mould and mould wa easily found in the bathroom my wife complained but all the staff could do wa find the missing outdoor furniture at dinner the first night we had difficulty finding plain food that would not aggravate our upset stomach the chef kindly offered to prepare mashed potato pea and grilled chicken for u the next night however the next day this offer wa undone by management who declared we had been selected for fine dining fearing this wa sringlish for extra spicy we gave up and went to bed early without dinned which we had already paid for at least at checkout a some compensation the hotel did not charge for the sandwich and hamburger we had at the bar after my wife presented mouldy toiletry to management they did offer to change room on the second day but it wa too little too late the hotel ha an impressive entrance and sea view but what good are those when the hotel fails the basic of room and food,1273,226

"The hotel needs refurbishment.  Some of the corridors and courtyards were in a very poor state. The meals were OK, although not up to 5 star standard. There was only one ala carte restaurant. The restaurant staff were a credit to the hotel - always willing to help. Unfortunately,  cant say the same of the reception staff who would benefit from a communication skills training course.  The Gym was very poorly equipped and certainly did not merit a 5 star status.",Recreation,the hotel need refurbishment some of the corridor and courtyard were in a very poor state the meal were ok although not up to star standard there wa only one ala carte restaurant the restaurant staff were a credit to the hotel always willing to help unfortunately cant say the same of the reception staff who would benefit from a communication skill training course the gym wa very poorly equipped and certainly did not merit a star status,464,81

"Our planned highlight, to the end of our Sri Lankan tour, was a frustrating disappointment.  We arrived tired and sick, hoping for a clean comfortable room and some simple food.  Even though we had booked and paid 6 months earlier, it took a long time to allocate us a room.  The room smelled of mould and mould was easily found in the bathroom. My wife complained, but all the staff could do was find the missing outdoor furniture. At dinner, the first night, we had difficulty finding plain food, that would not aggravate our upset stomachs.  The chef kindly offered to prepare mashed potatoes, peas and grilled chicken, for us, the next night. However, the next day, this offer was undone by management, who declared we had been selected for ""Fine dining"". Fearing this was Sringlish for extra spicy, we gave up and went to bed early, without dinned, which we had already paid for.  At least at checkout, as some compensation, the hotel did not charge for the sandwich and hamburger, we had at the bar.  After my wife presented mouldy toiletries to management, they did offer to change rooms, on the second day; but it was too little too late.  The hotel has an impressive entrance and sea view.

We were loking forward to staying at this hotel on the coast as we were not travelling to the Maldives.  However we were dissapointed with the service and food during our stay. The only savibg grace was being upgraded and the room we got was fantastic. The hotel is set in a great location but if you do not  like being hasseled on the so called private beach then this hotel is not for you. There were many locals on the beach trying to sell guests goods in full view of the scurity guards. However the security guards did not stop this from happening and we will not be returning to this hotel.,Food,we were loking forward to staying at this hotel on the coast a we were not travelling to the maldives however we were dissapointed with the service and food during our stay the only savibg grace wa being upgraded and the room we got wa fantastic the hotel is set in a great location but if you do not like being hasseled on the so called private beach then this hotel is not for you there were many local on the beach trying to sell guest good in full view of the scurity guard however the security guard did not stop this from happening and we will not be returning to this hotel,596,113

"We felt we could not relax whilst in the grounds, the local sellers both men and women, hid in the bushes of the hotel on the beach, waiting to get people's attention.  As soon as you stepped onto the beach, you were surrounded by them.  Also so much rubbish strewn about the perimeter.  Overall the hotel lacked any atmosphere, maybe it is too large for that?
The staff were all lovely and friendly.
