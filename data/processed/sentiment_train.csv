"We stayed in this hotel as the relax part of our trip to Sri Lanka. We can said that the others heritance hotels we been were better. Because you are in a village, we probably will have all your meals at the hotel, we were disappointed about the quality and the variation of the food during dinner. The hotel is very large and they have to swimming pool areas, the northern one has less people.",neutral,we stayed in this hotel a the relax part of our trip to sri lanka we can said that the others heritance hotel we been were better because you are in a village we probably will have all your meal at the hotel we were disappointed about the quality and the variation of the food during dinner the hotel is very large and they have to swimming pool area the northern one ha less people,394,75,4.266666666666667,0,0.4019,0.072,0.038,0.89,-0.03452380952380952,0.46845238095238095
"My wife and I spent the last two weeks of January here. The hotel is very nice, clean and the staff are attentive and helpful. The food in the buffet restaurant was OK.... nothing too special, but they try to cater for all tastes. We booked B&B only as we prefer not to be 'tied' to the same place for meals. However, outside the hotel, there is little choice along the beach. Only the 'sunshine bar' at the far Right as you look at the sea. The food there is simple, but very good and very reasonable. We eat at the 'Mustard' restaurant as well as the 'Fine Dining' restaurant that is within the hotel grounds. The food at both was very good, but because most of the guests were 'All Inclusive' and eat at the buffet, we dined alone in the other restaurants. I did have a bit of an issue with one of the 'room boys' though. The one we had at the start of our holiday was very attentive and made sure he told us each day that 'he was our room boy' (obviously after a tip at the end of the holiday). But he disappeared halfway through our time there. So, when we finally came to pack our bags, we gave our tip to the room boy that took over. However, as we walked with our cases to the lift, we were approached by the original room boy who made it obvious that he wanted a tip also. But we had already given our last Rupees away, so had nothing left. It was a cringingly embarrassing moment, which I didn't feel we should have been put in. I've seen comments here about the 'beach sellers' ... Our experience was nothing but good. I got friendly with a middle aged man called Pathmi, (usually wears a Red baseball cap and carries a Red Sri-Lanka tourism bag) He took me and his Nephew on a fishing trip in the mangroves. It was great. He also invited me back to his house, where his wife had cooked a 1.5kilo fish, potatoes, rice and curry sauce for lunch.... It was a real honour to go into his house as well as humbling..... So please look out for him on the beach. He's a real 'find'! If you are looking for a hotel that can provide good, clean accommodation, as well as good food and are happy to more or less stay around the hotel/beach area... this is a great place! If you are looking for a hotel, but would like to walk along the beach to find different restaurants, then look again. There's none there!

"We stayed in Heritance Ahungalla for 16 nights. I want to structure the Review in positive, neutral and negative things and because everyone seems to tell just the positive things i start with the negative ones. Negative: - Dirty beach; the Hotel does not care about the litter on the beach. Of course it is a public beach but there are only Hotel guests. Thats why they should clean it more often. - Beach Boys: they wait in front of the beach and even whistle or shout for someone. You always feel observed when you lie on the pool - Rooms are in poor condition. In the shower is mould, the curtains are dirty and the furniture is old (i enclosed some Pictures). This is definitely not 5-star-hotel-like! - The Hotel customer Service asked if we could give them a good tripadvisor-rating and they want to see if you give 5 points. Thats certainly the fact why there are so many good Reviews. - The Prices in the Hotel (if you dont have AI) are quite high. A 0,3 Liter Diet-Coke is about 3 Dollar, the dinner 26 Dollar. Very much for a Country like Sri Lanka. - When you leave the Hotel there are some Tuk-Tuk-Driver who want to bring you to the next herbal-farm or wants to sell you drugs. After our second try, we did not dare to go out -The Bar staff was quite slow and we had to wait almost 15 minutes till someone cared. That happened many times. Neutral: - Loud Room: We had a room over the bar and the bass was quite loud till 11 p.m. But most other rooms which are further away are certainly quiet. When we told this to the front desk they immediately offered another room Positive: - The architecture of the Hotel and the beautiful pools. - The Housekeeping and almost every Hotel employee was extremely friendly - The animals in the Hotel. There where cute chipmunks, funny apes, lovely ravens taking their bath in the pool, a lizard and even a big snake (i dont know if it was poisonous) - great Food. I dont think that you can find any better Food in Sri Lanka I just rate the Hotel with two out of five because it is made much better on tripadivor than it is for real. In my opinion it is not better than a european 3-Star-Hotel and i know that sri-lanka-standard is far lower than european but unfortunately the Prices are not like Sri Lanka (Massage 1 hour- 100 Dollar!)",negative,we stayed in heritance ahungalla for night i want to structure the review in positive neutral and negative thing and because everyone seems to tell just the positive thing i start with the negative one negative dirty beach the hotel doe not care about the litter on the beach of course it is a public beach but there are only hotel guest thats why they should clean it more often beach boy they wait in front of the beach and even whistle or shout for someone you always feel observed when you lie on the pool room are in poor condition in the shower is mould the curtain are dirty and the furniture is old i enclosed some picture this is definitely not starhotellike the hotel customer service asked if we could give them a good tripadvisorrating and they want to see if you give point thats certainly the fact why there are so many good review the price in the hotel if you dont have ai are quite high a liter dietcoke is about dollar the dinner dollar very much for a country like sri lanka when you leave the hotel there are some tuktukdriver who want to bring you to the next herbalfarm or want to sell you drug after our second try we did not dare to go out the bar staff wa quite slow and we had to wait almost minute till someone cared that happened many time neutral loud room we had a room over the bar and the bass wa quite loud till pm but most other room which are further away are certainly quiet when we told this to the front desk they immediately offered another room positive the architecture of the hotel and the beautiful pool the housekeeping and almost every hotel employee wa extremely friendly the animal in the hotel there where cute chipmunk funny ape lovely raven taking their bath in the pool a lizard and even a big snake i dont know if it wa poisonous great food i dont think that you can find any better food in sri lanka i just rate the hotel with two out of five because it is made much better on tripadivor than it is for real in my opinion it is not better than a european starhotel and i know that srilankastandard is far lower than european but unfortunately the price are not like sri lanka massage hour dollar,2286,428,4.343457943925234,3,0.9932,0.155,0.072,0.772,0.1293285533910534,0.5163081709956711

"A unique hotel, great service, but it’s getting old and needs work Whilst the room (suite) was large and well appointed, the bathroom in particular needs renovation. It’s just getting old and needs work. In particular the shower over a massive spa bath would be very difficult for someone unsteady on their feet to get into - apart from holding on to the glass shower screen there was nothing to hold on to.

"Have just returned from a two week trip to Sri Lanka (Nov04) where we based ourselves at the Triton Hotel, Ahungalla. I must say although the hotel needs a overhaul ( due to be completed from May05toNov05) we had a wonderfull stay there. The food was excellant at all times. The initial room was also lovely but upon discovery of a small leak we were instantly upgraded to a suite with no questions asked by the hotel. What seemed to set the hotel apart was simply its level of service. All employees from maintenance to guest relations were excellent and couldnt do enough to help. Weddings were also a source of pleasure as the hotel puts a real show on with the dancers, elephant and evening fireworks. The only downside was the beach sellers who are quite persistent and initially put you off visiting the beach. However after a few days they recognise and it becomes far less a hassle.

"We arrived at the hotel after almost 20 hours by plane and found out that espresso coffee is a special coffee and will have to pay, although it has the same taste and in no case was an espresso. I mention that we had an all-inclusive supplement and the coffee was included First Breakfast: i wanted an omelette I asked the chef to prepare ""well done"", but he became visibly irritated because I have explained in more detail. He said something in his language, evading after I asked him what he said. I inspected the room where I was staying and found that under the bed were traces of visible dust probably old before those who have been staying here previously, the bathroom is not the bathroom of a 5stars hotel. The towels are to used and have old stains. On the ceiling we discovered traces of mosquito / dead flies on the ceiling of the bathroom The beach behind the hotel filled with annoying vendors that are allowed by the security agents even inside of the hotel property limit. We found the waiters mostly unprepared, lazy and disinterested. At the pool if you order a drink lasts an eternity. In fact, if you order anything in this hotel last an eternity. The food at dinner buffet is an ordinary cantine and you can easily see that they recycle the food from evening to another or is the same food. The concept of all inclusive is a joke, because there are only a few types of local drinks and those bad. Beach towels are to used and have old stains. We chose the restaurant ""fine dining"", but the disappointment continued. We first drink comes after 15 minutes, and the food was brought after an hour of waiting and although you must have 15 / discount due prepaid package of all inclusive, we were charged 100 / requires that the next day to ask for explanations, explanations that reduced bill. However, the food is typical of a normal restaurant. Not bad, but nothing special. I have to mention that in the fine dining restaurant were only 2 tables with people. It was empty! The new years evening was ok, but we wanted to order champagne and they told us they are out of stock. We wanted Moet, they gave us Mumm. How can you not have stocks of champagne for New Years Eve? The food was very good. If this have been the food for all the holiday i could have forgot all the other things At 14.30 in the nect day the room was not cleaned in the context in which We left at 9 am the room. I ordered a soft drink included in all-inclusive package, it was added to the bill and replaced at the my request. Conclusion: if you're not careful pay twice. Wishing to relax at the beach we waited 30 minutes for the staff to find sun beds towels. Another breakfast: I asked two omelets ( for me and my husband) everything OK, I asked him and the third omelets for my son and the cook was getting nervous. The adventure continues...

"We were in rooms 209 and 210. Pros: - well laid out and planned hotel - swimming pool area is beautiful - proximity to beach lovely Cons: - hardly any lights in room-very dim - run down - wifi not too great - very sparse room-not even a coffee table! - kettle had a calcified or corroded heating element so we did not want to take a chance with boiling water for our morning coffee. While it was well camouflaged, there was no plug point attached to the kettle so it would had to be physically moved near a plug point to operate-bad design. - bathroom has windows with only dusty, uneven Venetian blinds for so-called privacy - floor was dirty with dirt stuck on it - room was smelling musty when we came in. Couldn't leave balcony door open for too long to air, due to mosquitoes. - no room numbers written on key card envelopes-had to go out the door to check! - no in-hotel numbers written near the phone - cobwebs on balcony panels-rubber coming off - hotel information papers in the binder were not in order-pages missing. - no in-room menu in room. - checking in took time and we were shown a seating area that was impractical to sit in as sofas were not placed opposite of each other but next to each other. We stood around for about 10-15 mins and no one even asked us to take a seat at another more practical area which was close by. - the man showed us everything in the room but to omitted to show us the balcony! We could not see it as it had opaque sliding type panels that covered the sliding windows - the towels and sheets did not smell fresh - hardly any vegetarian options in the menu to warrant the money so the only options were a la carte in the coffee shop and that were going to take 45 mins to order. That hardly seems fair for vegetarians, does it? Since there was no other option, we ordered 3 western choices from this menu. Unfortunately, we were disappointed with the quality and taste of all the options. The veg lasagne had pasta that was chewy, the pasta primavera had peas that were raw and the potato and bean 'pie' was in fact not a pie at all-just potatoes, onions and beans topped with cheese! - The place needs a lot of maintenance.which it wasn't getting - staff need to improve their English, esp since there are so many non srilankans visiting-language was definitely a barrier esp when it came to ordering food. - staff need to be better trained to know what the hotel offers-boy who showed us to rooms said we could get a la carte in the dining hall. Instead there was only a buffet and no a la carte. - in our room, 210, we had no locking system in the door inside the room-no latch or knob, so ostensibly, the master key could be used to open the door at any time from the outside, even while we are inside the room - no tissues in tissue box in room 209-poor housekeeping - took 20 mins and reminding a few times to get our coffee at breakfast - took a long time for the dirty plates piled up from the buffet breakfast to be cleared. Had to point it out. Sadly, the cons far outweighed the pros.

Attention to small details like the design of the trolley that brings welcome drinks to a guest checking in and the smiling faces of the front desk staff go a long way in first impressions. Although the property is 35 years old, it is very well maintained with huge trees planted in the stair-wells. The architecture and design and the room interiors all blend for an exotic asian experience. The meals are wonderful, the four bars in the hotel are superlative and the three swimming pools take your breath away. The conference was running two halls simultaneously and the meeting went off without a glitch. Three nights we had music concerts in the main hall and cocktails being served.

"We stayed at the Heritance Kandalama and were expecting the same high standard we had there. Unfortuantely we were very dissapointed by the Ahungalla.

Dirty tables left uncleared for hours, the most disgusting tea and coffee I have ever tasted in my entire life and service without a smile. The only thing positive I have to say about the hotel is its location and the morning walk you can take along the stretch of beach on your door step.

"Pros- Relaxed beach location with spacious rooms. Good choice of bars and restaurants. Excellent breakfast buffet. Friendly staff, especially in the restaurants and around the pool. Very nice, big pools. Lots of interesting wildlife. Laundry service was excellent and good value. Cons- There were some hawkers on the property around the pool area selling sarongs and tours. An annoyance when trying to relax. The air con in our room was not very effective. By contrast it was excellent in our kids room. There was black mold in the shower. When it rains, the communal corridors are prone to flooding. The room attendants are very pushy about tips. Our attendant Ranil visited our room a day before we left to tell us he wouldn’t be there the following day. We tipped him well, but the next day, the day of our checkout, a new room attendant who we didn’t know came into the room twice on the pretext of checking the minibar and hung around clearly also expecting to be tipped. We are always happy to tip for service, but this pushy experience made us quite uncomfortable and left a bad final impression of our stay. The day before leaving we asked for a late checkout on one of our two rooms and were told that would be possible for an extra $50 US. We happily agreed to this, but the following morning we were told neither room was available. This seems unlikely as the hotel was not at all busy (it was five days after the terrorist attacks). So we had a few hours hanging around the hot hotel common areas before our airport pickup.

"Having returned on 11th June after 12 nights at this hotel on vacation with my wife, I feel the need to express my gratitude for such an amazing holiday.

As soon as we arrived - the first impressions were..........wow. The brochures do not do this stunning hotel justice. Having had a long tiring journey, we were given a very warm welcome. We stayed in a Suite which was superb in every way. The rooms are serviced daily by friendly housekeeping staff to a very very high standard. I am a Executive Chef who is in charge of a group of Companies providing Fine Dining Catering with bespoke menu's to wealthy clientele, so I was intrigued to find out whether this 5* hotel would impress. I need not have questioned this thought. After talking to The Food and Beverage Manager, I was invited to look around the kitchens and meet their brigade. The kitchens were immaculate, staff spotless, motivated and relaxed in their work - delivering the most delicious fine dining experience.

"I was a part of a team coordinating a wedding to be held at Heritance Ahungalle on Saturday 20th Dec. All plans were in place and all of us in the coordinating team were moving ahead with the game plan when we got to know that the furniture supplier had messed up the order. Needless to say that all hell broke loose while we tried to work out an alternate solution, it was a mere 3 hours before the wedding ceremony. A lot of stress, tension and heart stopping moments later the furniture arrived at 3.00 pm, we had to set up and decorate 30 tables in 1 1/2 hours - guest were due to arrive at 4.30 pm. The team at Heritance Ahungalle, stepped up to the occasion, they deployed additional crew to unload and set up furniture and get it all going to ensure that the wedding set up was ready on time. Their attitude was fantastic - it was a case of everyone working together to give the couple a wedding to remember. The result was fantastic, everything was set up and ready for the wedding with mere moments to spare and it all looked brilliant. It was a result of brilliant cooperation, understanding and adrenaline. No one entering that marquee would have realised the tension we all had to work through - the set up looked stunning and the couple said that it was more than what they expected. What's important is that it was not the responsibility of the hotel to do all this and we in the coordinating crew know that if not for the team at Heritance Ahungalle lead by their F&B Manager Gamini we would not have been to get it all together on time for our clients and give them the wedding of their life. Thank you so much!

"This is our third trip to heritance ahungalla and had a really poor customer service. First we had to wait for more than 15 minutes for our welcome drink since lot of foreigners arrived just AFTER us and had to remind 3 staff members. we went only for lunch buffet and while entering the dining hall our tickets were checked, but while we were dining one lady approached us and wanted to know our room number, so we told we are here only for lunch. Then she again wanted to see our tickets one by one while we were having lunch giving the impression we havent paid. we were amazed by this 5 star treatment. This not what we are expecting after paying Rs 3500 per adult. we will never come back to this place.",negative,this is our third trip to heritance ahungalla and had a really poor customer service first we had to wait for more than minute for our welcome drink since lot of foreigner arrived just after u and had to remind staff member we went only for lunch buffet and while entering the dining hall our ticket were checked but while we were dining one lady approached u and wanted to know our room number so we told we are here only for lunch then she again wanted to see our ticket one by one while we were having lunch giving the impression we havent paid we were amazed by this star treatment this not what we are expecting after paying r per adult we will never come back to this place,708,135,4.2518518518518515,-2,0.8751,0.091,0.015,0.893,0.1388888888888889,0.5148148148148148
"I had read so many great reviews about this hotel and was really looking forward to staying here, and I somehow feel like I have stayed on another planet compared to the other people who reviewed here. I will comment that the Chef Sarun was fantastic and made the best meal we had in Sri Lanka, the gentleman who was serving us was very good. Now, the hotel is getting very tired and could use a renovation, I was first taken to a room with 2 single beds, being a couple this wasn't good enough, but also laying on the bed it was comfy, the second room had a double bed but was uncomfortable, so we left it to the young man who took us to the room to try and sort out something else - either putting blankets under or a pillow top, anything, we gave them 2hrs and nothing happened. I went to reception, spoke with the executive gentleman, who apologized and said we could look at other rooms, apparently they only have 1 type of mattress which I don't believe. In the meantime I had ordered food from the restaurant and was told it would still be another 15mins away, we proceeded to the next room, same, next room same, so I said I would settle just for the twin singles as we were only staying one night. He then said he would get a new room sorted out and have our luggage moved. When I got back, my food was waiting and it was cold, less than 15mins. I advised the waiter and he said thanks- what for ????? We waited 1hr for no key, went to reception and collected our new room key. Went to the room, located at the end of the hotel, and our luggage was not there yet. Next thing I'm looking at the table and there is ANTS EVERYWHERE, now I'm talking about 1000+ all having a little party on the ground and under the table, walking down the walls etc. I have plenty of photos which I will put up when I have better Internet at home. I rang front desk and we got moved again 2 doors down, we went for a swim for 1hr again, come back and there was more ANTS in the room. We didn't get offered another room, but got dinner which is the only reason this gets a 2 star and not 1. We didn't sleep very well and the band / music was playing very loud well into the night. We had to check out at 7am, I had ordered a breakfast, but when I went to check out, I was hauled to the cashier office, and they kept me there for 10mins arguing about the meal from the afternoon which was cold and I was told would be taken off the room, and, they also tried to charge me for a phone call from my room, which was the executive ringing the manager about the ANTS. The lady who apparently was guest relations needs to be sacked, the cashier needs to be sacked for trying to rip me off. This left the worst taste in my opinion of Sri Lanka and I cannot believe this hotels staff would act like this to customers. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone, hopefully management looks at this and takes action.",negative,i had read so many great review about this hotel and wa really looking forward to staying here and i somehow feel like i have stayed on another planet compared to the other people who reviewed here i will comment that the chef sarun wa fantastic and made the best meal we had in sri lanka the gentleman who wa serving u wa very good now the hotel is getting very tired and could use a renovation i wa first taken to a room with single bed being a couple this wasnt good enough but also laying on the bed it wa comfy the second room had a double bed but wa uncomfortable so we left it to the young man who took u to the room to try and sort out something else either putting blanket under or a pillow top anything we gave them hr and nothing happened i went to reception spoke with the executive gentleman who apologized and said we could look at other room apparently they only have type of mattress which i dont believe in the meantime i had ordered food from the restaurant and wa told it would still be another min away we proceeded to the next room same next room same so i said i would settle just for the twin single a we were only staying one night he then said he would get a new room sorted out and have our luggage moved when i got back my food wa waiting and it wa cold less than min i advised the waiter and he said thanks what for we waited hr for no key went to reception and collected our new room key went to the room located at the end of the hotel and our luggage wa not there yet next thing im looking at the table and there is ant everywhere now im talking about all having a little party on the ground and under the table walking down the wall etc i have plenty of photo which i will put up when i have better internet at home i rang front desk and we got moved again door down we went for a swim for hr again come back and there wa more ant in the room we didnt get offered another room but got dinner which is the only reason this get a star and not we didnt sleep very well and the band music wa playing very loud well into the night we had to check out at am i had ordered a breakfast but when i went to check out i wa hauled to the cashier office and they kept me there for min arguing about the meal from the afternoon which wa cold and i wa told would be taken off the room and they also tried to charge me for a phone call from my room which wa the executive ringing the manager about the ant the lady who apparently wa guest relation need to be sacked the cashier need to be sacked for trying to rip me off this left the worst taste in my opinion of sri lanka and i can not believe this hotel staff would act like this to customer i would not recommend this hotel to anyone hopefully management look at this and take action,2893,567,4.1040564373897706,2,0.9055,0.064,0.041,0.895,0.06440859027593725,0.4539011102276409

"I'm from Kandy. We (myself and my wife) went to Kandalama in dabulla and had a great time So we wanted to take our parents as well. It's pointless of going to the same place (Kandalama) twice therefore we decided to go to ahungama heritance since it's all from the same family. There's about 220km from kandy (up and down both about 450-500Km) it was along trip. by the time we got to the hotel it was 5.00pm on 05/12/2015. We told the reception we have 2 bookings, one double room and one triple room. The welcoming lady was a fat girl and she was very rude to us she did not support at all even when filling the forms during the check in. and she took us to our rooms Double room (215)was ok but the triple room was very small (216) and fully packed most of all there were only 2 beds, so when i inquire about the 3rd bed from that girl we said "" Ah.... ok i will send a folding bed for you"" As if like we are servants/slaves. I told her politely. I request for a triple room and I have already done the payment by visiting to your headoffice at aitken spence colombo. Her reply was ""all our rooms are this size there is nothing we can do"" I said if you put another folding bed here, there is no space even to walk in this room. Her reply was ""Sorry"" she said it in a way either you take the room or go home, and she went away saying she will send someone with the folding bed. My mother said ""don't be mad putha we all came here to enjoy not to fight the other room(215) seems to be a bit large so we shifted to the next room. Then again I thought I already paid for a triple room and I don't get the service I wanted. If the hotel has only double rooms, they should have told me when booking. they never told me that. I got mad. I called the reception and requested to connect with the manager. Unfortunately manager was not there and an executive officer was available named ""Chathuranga"" I told him about my situation. I have child about 10 months old. Myself mywife my child and my mother all are staying at this room, and the room is too small. he quietly listened to my situation and he asked me 5 mins and call back. then he called me and say ""sir we have a large room vacant you can shift to that room"" I was delighted we all went there to enjoy not to suffer and stay in a room like in a prison cell. Then again I called to chathuranga and appologised him for getting mad and raising my voice what he told me shocking. he told me ""sir it's better you told me now rather than checking out, if so we couldn't have done anything for you.",negative,im from kandy we myself and my wife went to kandalama in dabulla and had a great time so we wanted to take our parent a well it pointless of going to the same place kandalama twice therefore we decided to go to ahungama heritance since it all from the same family there about km from kandy up and down both about km it wa along trip by the time we got to the hotel it wa pm on we told the reception we have booking one double room and one triple room the welcoming lady wa a fat girl and she wa very rude to u she did not support at all even when filling the form during the check in and she took u to our room double room wa ok but the triple room wa very small and fully packed most of all there were only bed so when i inquire about the rd bed from that girl we said ah ok i will send a folding bed for you a if like we are servantsslaves i told her politely i request for a triple room and i have already done the payment by visiting to your headoffice at aitken spence colombo her reply wa all our room are this size there is nothing we can do i said if you put another folding bed here there is no space even to walk in this room her reply wa sorry she said it in a way either you take the room or go home and she went away saying she will send someone with the folding bed my mother said dont be mad putha we all came here to enjoy not to fight the other room seems to be a bit large so we shifted to the next room then again i thought i already paid for a triple room and i dont get the service i wanted if the hotel ha only double room they should have told me when booking they never told me that i got mad i called the reception and requested to connect with the manager unfortunately manager wa not there and an executive officer wa available named chathuranga i told him about my situation i have child about month old myself mywife my child and my mother all are staying at this room and the room is too small he quietly listened to my situation and he asked me min and call back then he called me and say sir we have a large room vacant you can shift to that room i wa delighted we all went there to enjoy not to suffer and stay in a room like in a prison cell then again i called to chathuranga and appologised him for getting mad and raising my voice what he told me shocking he told me sir it better you told me now rather than checking out if so we couldnt have done anything for you,2546,504,4.053571428571429,-2,0.9443,0.079,0.05,0.87,-0.004056689342403625,0.49583900226757377

Positive Points: - Friendly Staff - Nice local food - All inclusive formula is nearly perfect (will come back later to this) - Nice views of the pool - Nice, clean and big rooms - Wifi EVERYWHERE Negative Points: - All inclusive doesn't include ""light"" drinks, so as a person with Sugar disease you can not take Cola Light but only regular Cola. This is something where they should look for an alternative for people who can not have that much sugar and don't like water. - The people at the beach who try to sell you stuff, they are nice and friendly, but if you are friendly back and buy some stuff, they just keep coming asking for more, asking for drinks, milkshakes,... This is something to watch.

"4 of us stayed here from the 7th to the 18th of January. We had originally booked the Turyya Hotel , also 5 STAR , but had a call from our tour operator MERCURY to see if we wanted to change to the Heritance because the Turyya had been downgraded to a 4 Star Hotel due to a lot of complaints. We were happy to book into the Heritance . But did not have the good experience that we had expected. Our rooms were quite dirty . So much so that my daughter cleaned her room with a packet of Babywipes. My Husband did some cleaning with a towel . I refused to do so . I do not think that this should be part of my Holiday. Then we checked our pillows and duvet and had a big shock. We took our bedding to the lobby and were quickly ushered in to a back room . After complaining we were offered an , as the Manager called it , an upgraded room. We were taken to have a look at the room and were happy to move in to it . It was actually exactly the same room as the dirty one but newly decorated with a new shower etc. Before we moved in to the new room the manager asked would it be Ok if he would go and check the bedding . Of course we agreed . At around 11 o'clock I heard loud voices from my daughters room . I went to see what was going on and again the bedding was dirty . Duvet cover had a big brown stain on it and one of the pillows had mould all over it. The manager told us "" that is why we put 2 pillow cases on it "" OH DEAR !!!!!! But after that , I must praise the boys who cleaned our room , everything was spotless. The next day at mealtimes we were surprised that the restaurant staff seemed to be totally confused . It was a bit like FAULY TOWERS . There were other issues but it would take to long to mention them all .

"Heritance Ahungalla is a decent hotel with excellent staff. Stayed three nights with family and friends and the staff were always obliging and eager to please. They also work hard. The hotel was busy and it covers a big area and the staff were as busy as bees. But always good to the guests. Where I mark the hotel down is: a) The hotel is dated and looking very tired. I think one wing looked recently renovated, but the wing we stayed in, although clean, looked too tired. It badly needs an upgrade. A '5 star' should not be allowed to deteriorate to this extent before renovation b) It's a large hotel but surprisingly low on activities. As a result there is no 'wow' factor to justify the expensive rates. The beach is nice and it's a long stretch but the hotel is strangely lifeless and boring. As it is I would say this is a '4 star'. We had a nice time but there are so many options in Sri Lanka now and there isn't a good enough reason to return to this hotel.",neutral,heritance ahungalla is a decent hotel with excellent staff stayed three night with family and friend and the staff were always obliging and eager to please they also work hard the hotel wa busy and it cover a big area and the staff were a busy a bee but always good to the guest where i mark the hotel down is a the hotel is dated and looking very tired i think one wing looked recently renovated but the wing we stayed in although clean looked too tired it badly need an upgrade a star should not be allowed to deteriorate to this extent before renovation b it a large hotel but surprisingly low on activity a a result there is no wow factor to justify the expensive rate the beach is nice and it a long stretch but the hotel is strangely lifeless and boring a it is i would say this is a star we had a nice time but there are so many option in sri lanka now and there isnt a good enough reason to return to this hotel,968,185,4.237837837837838,3,-0.6914,0.115,0.131,0.754,0.053215873015873,0.5840984126984128

"Ahungalla Heritance Hotel is reassuring when you arrive through its private drive after passing the entrance arch gate. It keeps being reassuring when you discover the open reception to the swimming pool that visually extends straight into the Indian Ocean just few meters away until … you end up checking in at a bar behind the reception that was very dark as most of its lights were switch off; was it a try of being Eco friendly ?? We had a strange feeling that the hotel was not up to its 5*. This obvious detail was like the top of an iceberg; will we discover the rest of it along our stay? Was Heritance a 5* iceberg? The room was ok, yet had aged and would need a lift. There was no safe deposit (5*?). The room maintenance appeared secondary as we noticed an obvious splash of dirt on the terrace door window and one of the door lock was broken. At “Mustard coffee shop”, we ordered seafood salad, it came with no salad or veggies (misleading salad term). We checked the “UpperRestaurant” menu and were not impressed by its presentation neither by the incomprehensive culinary composition of its expensive dishes. The restaurant was empty … lack of soul, poor lighting, no spark. Instead we went to this little Coconut Hut restaurant down the beach out of the hotel, where we really had a superb and reasonable diner, thank you to Berthy the owner for his welcome. We recommend it. Back to our room, we were not blown by the auto glorifying video of Heritance Ahungalla that was played in random on the hotel TV channel, it sounded too superlative to be true. The Heritance corporate management needs to open its eyes, international real 5* hotel are on their way to Sri Lanka and soon they may be at the origin of the end of Heritance Hotels 5 * era. The F & B department should also be worry and revise its restaurants concepts and put its heart and mind into it.",neutral,ahungalla heritance hotel is reassuring when you arrive through it private drive after passing the entrance arch gate it keep being reassuring when you discover the open reception to the swimming pool that visually extends straight into the indian ocean just few meter away until you end up checking in at a bar behind the reception that wa very dark a most of it light were switch off wa it a try of being eco friendly we had a strange feeling that the hotel wa not up to it this obvious detail wa like the top of an iceberg will we discover the rest of it along our stay wa heritance a iceberg the room wa ok yet had aged and would need a lift there wa no safe deposit the room maintenance appeared secondary a we noticed an obvious splash of dirt on the terrace door window and one of the door lock wa broken at mustard coffee shop we ordered seafood salad it came with no salad or veggie misleading salad term we checked the upperrestaurant menu and were not impressed by it presentation neither by the incomprehensive culinary composition of it expensive dish the restaurant wa empty lack of soul poor lighting no spark instead we went to this little coconut hut restaurant down the beach out of the hotel where we really had a superb and reasonable diner thank you to berthy the owner for his welcome we recommend it back to our room we were not blown by the auto glorifying video of heritance ahungalla that wa played in random on the hotel tv channel it sounded too superlative to be true the heritance corporate management need to open it eye international real hotel are on their way to sri lanka and soon they may be at the origin of the end of heritance hotel era the f b department should also be worry and revise it restaurant concept and put it heart and mind into it,1874,342,4.482456140350878,0,0.9432,0.114,0.075,0.812,0.016304012345679002,0.4328858024691358

"We know the hotel as we used to stay there several years in a row some years ago. The architecture is stunning, but some improvements on the rooms are needed to bring it back to 5 star standards. Upon check-in we were early and were told that normal check-in time is 2 pm. We waited for 2 1/2 hours til 2 pm and several inquiries, there we were told, that they are checking. At 2 pm it seems everybody arriving after us was checked-in and we still did not get any information. I went to the reception to complain, but they were busy to set up other guests internet on the phone than to attend to guests who were waiting for 2 1/2 hours. After asking for the manager it suddenly worked and we got a room and apology. Although we asked for the new wing, we were offered a room in the old wing. Despite of kitchen odor this room was definitely the better choice for us as on the other side a 2 day party was going on with lots of noise. Room was ok and had a nice sea view. Cleanliness of the room could have been better. Especially in the shower there were signs of mould and shower door was completely covered with limescale. Service especially upon check-in was definitely not 5 star standard. Also for breakfast it was announced to start at 7 am, but when we came down ones at 7.10 am, nothing was ready, noone was taking note in order to serve coffee or tea. The egg corner was not occupied to order eggs, etc. If 7 am is published for breakfast, it should be ready for service. Food was very good though. Another point to reconsider might be the christmas decoration which did not fit the hotel at all. All in all we had a nice stay in the end. If we would come back, we are not sure as we know better from this hotel from previous stays and it is quite pricy for the service offered.",neutral,we know the hotel a we used to stay there several year in a row some year ago the architecture is stunning but some improvement on the room are needed to bring it back to star standard upon checkin we were early and were told that normal checkin time is pm we waited for hour til pm and several inquiry there we were told that they are checking at pm it seems everybody arriving after u wa checkedin and we still did not get any information i went to the reception to complain but they were busy to set up other guest internet on the phone than to attend to guest who were waiting for hour after asking for the manager it suddenly worked and we got a room and apology although we asked for the new wing we were offered a room in the old wing despite of kitchen odor this room wa definitely the better choice for u a on the other side a day party wa going on with lot of noise room wa ok and had a nice sea view cleanliness of the room could have been better especially in the shower there were sign of mould and shower door wa completely covered with limescale service especially upon checkin wa definitely not star standard also for breakfast it wa announced to start at am but when we came down one at am nothing wa ready noone wa taking note in order to serve coffee or tea the egg corner wa not occupied to order egg etc if am is published for breakfast it should be ready for service food wa very good though another point to reconsider might be the christmas decoration which did not fit the hotel at all all in all we had a nice stay in the end if we would come back we are not sure a we know better from this hotel from previous stay and it is quite pricy for the service offered,1787,346,4.167630057803469,2,0.9882,0.119,0.029,0.852,0.1460669191919192,0.47121843434343436
"I couldn't agree more with the comments below. We stayed there from 26th December until after New Year. Had we been able to get a refund we would have moved out on day 1! Firstly, despite what their website says, all rooms do NOT have a sea view. We were given a room overlooking the tennis courts. After a huge discussion, they said that we could move to a lower category room - where a seaview was availabile - BUT they wouldn't refund us the £450 difference. After I pointed out that they were falsely advertising, the local agent out there agreed to pay for us to upgrade us to a luxury suite - however, the hotel really should have picked up this cost as their website was giving incorrect information! The suite was ok - but not worth the money they charge. Again, their website states luxury goods and free sparkling wine, fruit etc. None of those things materialised! The shower gel was provided in glass bottles which took forever to let the gel out. There was no conditioner, no bubble bath and the cotton buds were only supplied on the first day - all basic things for a 5 star hotel! The lighting is also totally illogical as the person states below. It's certainly not a luxury 5 star property. There's water aerobics in the pool every day - with loud techno music blaring out of the speakers. They had Karaoke in one bar and a very naff electronic keyboard player belting out songs like ""lady in red"" in the other. Not exclusive property that it claims to be! The sun loungers had dirty cushions - which didn't even cover the whole of the lounger - and there weren't enough for the number of guests. You were also shouted at by the hawkers from the beach - which really shouldn't happen at this type of property (I've stayed at lots in Sri Lanka and nowhere else is like that!) Finally, the food.

"I live in Dubai, so I know what a USD$400 per night hotel room should get you. Therefore, in Sri Lanka, it should be at least on par - if not a thousand times better. This review comes with a disclaimer – the hotel did compensate me with a rather dramatic discount upon departure. I do not believe that this hotel can realistically charge the amount they do for this level of property and service. In the end I believe we paid a fair amount for what we received. They begged me not to write a bad review, so I will not, but I will state the truth. Let’s start with the “pros”: - Beautifully designed hotel with authentic colonial architecture. - Lovely view from most of the balconies. - Several dining options available. - Good bathrooms. - Good a/c in rooms. - Massages at the spa are heavenly. Probably the best I’ve ever had! - Management responded well to our complaints. Now over to the “cons”: - The “confirmed” airport transfer was not booked. We waited 2 hours at the airport before they finally arranged. - Our room was filthy. Even after complaining it did not improve. - Room service, bar and snack menus are the same. No Sri Lankan food in sight! - Manicure and hair treatments at the spa were disastrous (rough nails and stripped colour from hair). - Dirty linen at all F&B outlets and room service.",negative,i live in dubai so i know what a usd per night hotel room should get you therefore in sri lanka it should be at least on par if not a thousand time better this review come with a disclaimer the hotel did compensate me with a rather dramatic discount upon departure i do not believe that this hotel can realistically charge the amount they do for this level of property and service in the end i believe we paid a fair amount for what we received they begged me not to write a bad review so i will not but i will state the truth let start with the pro beautifully designed hotel with authentic colonial architecture lovely view from most of the balcony several dining option available good bathroom good ac in room massage at the spa are heavenly probably the best ive ever had management responded well to our complaint now over to the con the confirmed airport transfer wa not booked we waited hour at the airport before they finally arranged our room wa filthy even after complaining it did not improve roomservice bar and snack menu are the same no sri lankan food in sight manicure and hair treatment at the spa were disastrous rough nail and stripped colour from hair dirty linen at all fb outlet and roomservice,1313,241,4.452282157676349,2,0.9579,0.136,0.081,0.783,0.1478650137741047,0.6178030303030304

"We finally decided to give this hotel a shot as we were traveling through the area mainly due to its architecture (Jeffrey Bower design) and location. Sadly this place failed us. Trivago lists the room that we were given for around $90 US. We paid $175 per night for the two day stay with the full understanding that we'll be getting a decent room. I was expecting much better accommodations given it's the off season and the hotel in near empty. Firt room we got was so bad that I refused it immediately. They then moved us to a different ""deluxe"" room, as I was told, which was marginally better than the first one. The bathroom is dirty, no bath robes in the room and the view is sub par. The room is located in the far corner of the hotel. It is a smoking room and we were not offered the option to choose whether we needed a smoking room or not. It's puzzling to me that the hotel staff felt this room is consistent with a 5 star hotel. I'd rate this place and our experience at 3 stars at best! I've given them two opportunities to rectify the situation and they utterly failed both times. They've had a golden opportunity to wow us and grantee a repeat customer but for some reason, that I still can't understand, they chose to make sure that we will not come back again. In this copetitive field, where there are many other options availabe, the accommodation we've received is not what I had expected from a Heritance chain (Kandalama in contrast was fantastic). We'll be in this country 3 more days and was hoping to to spend it in this area had they met our expectations. Instead we'll be moving to the Hilton in Colombo for the remainder of our stay. Needless to say that this is the first and the last time for us in this perticular facility. Situation of this type do not warrant a third chance. To the management team... look very closely into the culture that is set forth. I don't think you can afford to have customers like us, who travel all over the world and are often in Sri Lanka, to be this dissatisfied with your facilities. Every one that complains on a site like this, ten goes without taking the time to do so yet they are just as dissatisfied. You're alianating the very customers that is your life blood.

"We are staying at the Heritance Ahungalla during the monsoon low season, but weather has been great. The hotel is a beautiful Geoffrey Bawa resort, not new but reasonably well maintained. We have a lovely comfortable, well appointed room, spotlessly clean and attended to each day. Beautiful swimming pool (can't swim in the ocean at this time of year as it's too rough). Friendly staff. Great breakfast. So why aren't I giving this resort 5 stars? A few problems. Firstly the service at the outdoor bar area is very slow for simple snacks/ lunch. You wait and wait for a simple sandwich for example. Prices are very high. With tax and service we just paid 2,000 rupee for a bottle of Lion beer, a lime and soda and bowl of devilled cashews. The resort feels a bit isolated and there aren't obvious alternatives for dining etc. (that may explain the high prices.) The resort is large. Next time I will stay in all boutique hotels and guest houses for more personalised service and better value in Sri Lanka. I feel a bit ripped off at this resort (and we have stayed at a range of places around Sri Lanka). Even up market resorts need to understand that there is a limit to what tourists will pay for basics.",positive,we are staying at the heritance ahungalla during the monsoon low season but weather ha been great the hotel is a beautiful geoffrey bawa resort not new but reasonably well maintained we have a lovely comfortable well appointed room spotlessly clean and attended to each day beautiful swimming pool cant swim in the ocean at this time of year a it too rough friendly staff great breakfast so why arent i giving this resort star a few problem firstly the service at the outdoor bar area is very slow for simple snack lunch you wait and wait for a simple sandwich for example price are very high with tax and service we just paid rupee for a bottle of lion beer a lime and soda and bowl of devilled cashew the resort feel a bit isolated and there arent obvious alternative for dining etc that may explain the high price the resort is large next time i will stay in all boutique hotel and guest house for more personalised service and better value in sri lanka i feel a bit ripped off at this resort and we have stayed at a range of place around sri lanka even up market resort need to understand that there is a limit to what tourist will pay for basic,1208,218,4.545871559633028,6,0.9913,0.193,0.062,0.745,0.25899044011544015,0.5351139971139971

"We checked in to the room not knowing they have given us a twin room. What made us upset was the girl who escorted us to the room Dinushi, the excuse she gave was ""if you checked in early we would have given you a better room"" I was stunned! I immediately told them that we will be checking out the next morning even though we were booked for two nights. It was around 6pm when we checked in and we were too tired after traveling from colombo otherwise I would have definitely checked out the same night. Room was so small and very dirty and old. Bathroom was very small and mind you a huge cockroach was running over our bathroom amenities imagine using rhose tooth brushes and soap and those refill type shampoo bottles which were anyway spilt. I was so upset I cabt tell you how much because we were there to celebrate a birthday. It was all ruined. Later on the duty manager came and ask whether we would do a room change and said the hotel was full but we didnt want to trouble the house keeping staff as we were anyway going to check out next morning. Food at the restaurant was ok but not the best of heritance maybe the reason why was because all the guests were locals. Restaurant staff was good. Friendly. Next morning when we came down to the lobby to check out, i cant believe the same girl Dinushi's attitude towards us. Even though I looked at her she made sure to frown at me. Not bothered to atleast talk to us nor apologize. Wow I am from the same industry and I cant imagine the way she acted.

"We stayed 5 nights as an add-on to our two week island tour when the hotel was busy mainly with German, Russian and Ukrainian guests many of who were in large groups and are on all inclusive packages. Its is a quiet location on a beautiful beach with no other hotels nearby. Whilst we were there the sea was quite rough with a strong undercurrent. There is a well designed and maintained infinity pool, just off the lobby, that blends in with the sea giving the impression that you are actually in the sea. There is also another large pool elsewhere in the grounds. We were disappointed with the deluxe room that we were offered and so paid considerably more (although discounted) for a luxury suite upgrade which was very nice though was somewhat more than we needed though nothing else appeared to be available. The main restaurant (Jute) serves an excellent buffet as it offers a large choice of good quality international food though with probably less Asian dishes than we had at other hotels elsewhere. The groups sit at large tables in middle of this restaurant and can be quite noisy at dinner times. Our room hotel guide stated that attire for dinner was ‘smart casual’ though this was largely ignored by many guests and especially by some men who wore jeans, shorts, T shirts and football shirts. Beach fine dining was excellent with a good choice of dishes from an a la carte menu including some wonderful seafood. Attentive and friendly service made this a truly memorable occasion. There was a lack of sun beds and umbrellas around the pools and grounds. Also, the sun beds and towels were old and many of the beds were broken or had wheels missing so there was the daily early morning rush to get towels on good beds with umbrellas. The hotel needs to invest money in buying new furniture and towels to ensure there are enough for all guests. Lunchtime food at the pool bar was limited to burgers, sandwiches and half a dozen other snacks which really should be supplemented by some salads and some more Asian snacks. Service in the grounds Service away from the two pools was infrequent and we usually had to walk to the bar to buy drinks. We have discussed our views with a representative of the hotels management (Dinusha Kularatne) who says he will be writing a report detailing our comments. It's a good hotel but it didn't live up to our expectations of the luxury hotel we wanted at the end of our holiday.",neutral,we stayed night a an addon to our two week island tour when the hotel wa busy mainly with german russian and ukrainian guest many of who were in large group and are on all inclusive package it is a quiet location on a beautiful beach with no other hotel nearby whilst we were there the sea wa quite rough with a strong undercurrent there is a well designed and maintained infinity pool just off the lobby that blend in with the sea giving the impression that you are actually in the sea there is also another large pool elsewhere in the ground we were disappointed with the deluxe room that we were offered and so paid considerably more although discounted for a luxury suite upgrade which wa very nice though wa somewhat more than we needed though nothing else appeared to be available the main restaurant jute serf an excellent buffet a it offer a large choice of good quality international food though with probably less asian dish than we had at other hotel elsewhere the group sit at large table in middle of this restaurant and can be quite noisy at dinner time our room hotel guide stated that attire for dinner wa smart casual though this wa largely ignored by many guest and especially by some men who wore jean short t shirt and football shirt beach fine dining wa excellent with a good choice of dish from an a la carte menu including some wonderful seafood attentive and friendly service made this a truly memorable occasion there wa a lack of sun bed and umbrella around the pool and ground also the sun bed and towel were old and many of the bed were broken or had wheel missing so there wa the daily early morning rush to get towel on good bed with umbrella the hotel need to invest money in buying new furniture and towel to ensure there are enough for all guest lunchtime food at the pool bar wa limited to burger sandwich and half a dozen other snack which really should be supplemented by some salad and some more asian snack service in the ground service away from the two pool wa infrequent and we usually had to walk to the bar to buy drink we have discussed our view with a representative of the hotel management dinusha kularatne who say he will be writing a report detailing our comment it a good hotel but it didnt live up to our expectation of the luxury hotel we wanted at the end of our holiday,2427,433,4.607390300230947,3,0.9632,0.086,0.03,0.884,0.2209085497835498,0.44819083694083695
"We stayed at this hotel for a week at the end of a touring holiday in Sri Lanka. It is claimed to be the only five-star hotel on this coast, which is not entirely accurate. In some aspects the hotel is very good - the two huge swimming pools, large public areas, well spread-out accommodation & nicely-appointed rooms - and deserves its five stars. However, there are some aspects which are not five-star and were a source of irritation during our stay. For example, on the whole, the food was very good but tended to be served not very hot, and is rather expensive for what it is. We tried the buffet, which is OK, but very expensive. We had several meals in the Coffee Shop, which is more reasonable in price but, despite being a la carte, we twice had to send food back because it was virtually cold. Getting things like that fixed, which would happen promptly in a real 5-star hotel, seemed to take an age. Service is helpful & charming, but inept and inefficient at times. There often seems to be no-one on duty with sufficient authority to make a decision about things. Complaints are handled by constantly referring them to some-one else, who often is not in a position to actually do anything, other than telling someone else. The staff are not very quick to clear up after the rain sweeps into the public areas (which are tiled) leaving very slippery surfaces around for too long.

"Right on the beach, 2 beautiful pools, and really lovely staff - who are definitely the major asset. But WHY do the bathrooms look so unclean? our shower screen was limescaled (heavily), the floors and walls needed upgrading as they were scuffed and marked and impossible to clean (polished concrete walls au naturel! - but evidently the architect who designed them loves the effect so it doesn't matter!). On the plus side the bed was wonderfully comfortable. Breakfast was in a low ceilinged dark room (often smokey from the cooking of bacon or hoppers) - where you help yourselves but have to wait for tea/coffee (i.e. flag down a waiter if you can catch their eye - although there are always plenty of them around) - and geared to Big Appetites and touring parties. The dinner buffet food in the same room was lukewarm and no one attends it to ensure it is stirred/kept hot. The menus are very restricted. Where are all the delicious tastes of Sri Lanka? Why travel all this distance to eat (mediocre) European food! The middle range restaurant (I think it was called Mustard) with a terrace overlooking the pool was the best, as the food was cooked to order, and the staff more than willing to experiment with something off the menu if they had the ingredients. The beauty salon was staffed by wonderful Balinese girls who gave a very good deep tissue massage - but the standard of the treatment rooms (just converted bedrooms) was poor.

"We have just spent over a week at the much vaunted Geoffrey Bawa designed Heritance Hotel. We enjoyed our week on the coast but find it tough to rate the hotel better than average. No doubt in its day the hotel would have been considered ahead of its time however today its minimalist design and decor highlight the fact that hotel is getting tired. The rooms have apparently been renovated recently and they are OK however the public areas are uninspiring. We visited a number of hotels on the coast while in the area. It was noticeable how many are either new - Chaaya at Hikkaduwa or recently upgraded - and Surf and Avani at Bentota, or in the process of being renovated - Vivanta by Taj at Bentota. The latter, based on the upgrade we saw to date, is going to be fantastic. The Heritance will need to watch its competition. The beach is nice once you've been rude to the touts to keep them off. Tourist information is not readily available and most things you'll want to do are away from Ahungalla. We got most information and help in getting around from the on site taxi drivers who can arrange pretty much anything including motor bike hire which despite the local traffic we would recommend. Tuk Tuk drivers outside the hotel are bad news - rude and argumentative which we didn't find anywhere else. Finally the hotel entertainment is amateurish.

"Since we had already experienced the exceptional hospitality at Heritance Kandalama and The Sands at Kalutara (Aitken Spence properties), we booked our Christmas vacation at Heritance Ahungalla a couple of months back to avoid disappointment. When we arrived at the property we were pleasantly surprised to find out that we had been upgraded to the Luxury Suite with the garden balcony. The Suite (room 324) was HUGE compared to a regular room, in fact if I am not mistaken, the bathroom of the suite probably had the same square footage as a regular room, with a 2 person bathtub, a shower stall, double sinks and a huge walk in closet. The suite was richly appointed with real furniture including a small library. My 13yr old was thrilled to find an age appropriate book by Rick Riordan that she had not previously read. The bedroom had a comfortable king sized Four Poster bed and a recliner. Mini fridge, TV, surround sound system and tea/coffee service rounded off the comforts. Food was excellent as this hotel's chefs had emerged as the Most Outstanding Culinary Team in Sri Lanka after competing against both international and domestic star-class city and resort hotels at the 15th Culinary Art Competition. Sous chef Roshan Pujitha was kind enough to show us some of the culinary masterpieces and their chocolate factory. Most nights were theme nights, and on the night where they served Chinese food, we were prepared to order A la Carte for our daughter who has nut allergies, but the server quickly brought her a plate of Lasagna from another restaurant at no extra charge. the wait staff was attentive and responded to our requests in a timely manner. The rooms were clean and well stocked with fresh towels, bath robes and bottled water. The room steward came every evening to make sure we had fresh towels and to turn down the beds. Fresh fruit was also delivered to the room. The only issue we had was, we wanted the vacation over Christmas, but we were told that the hotel was booked solid. This was not the case as there were plenty of vacant rooms available. This was a bit of a disappointment since we really wanted to be away during Christmas. It was a pleasant surprise to meet Ms Niranjala the hostess, who was also at Heritance Kandalama during our visit to that property in August, and she recognized us and came over to chat. It was an enjoyable experience and a great vacation.",neutral,since we had already experienced the exceptional hospitality at heritance kandalama and the sand at kalutara aitken spence property we booked our christmas vacation at heritance ahungalla a couple of month back to avoid disappointment when we arrived at the property we were pleasantly surprised to find out that we had been upgraded to the luxury suite with the garden balcony the suite room wa huge compared to a regular room in fact if i am not mistaken the bathroom of the suite probably had the same square footage a a regular room with a person bathtub a shower stall double sink and a huge walk in closet the suite wa richly appointed with real furniture including a small library my yr old wa thrilled to find an age appropriate book by rick riordan that she had not previously read the bedroom had a comfortable king sized four poster bed and a recliner mini fridge tv surround sound system and teacoffee service rounded off the comfort food wa excellent a this hotel chef had emerged a the most outstanding culinary team in sri lanka after competing against both international and domestic starclass city and resort hotel at the th culinary art competition sou chef roshan pujitha wa kind enough to show u some of the culinary masterpiece and their chocolate factory most night were theme night and on the night where they served chinese food we were prepared to order a la carte for our daughter who ha nut allergy but the server quickly brought her a plate of lasagna from another restaurant at no extra charge the wait staff wa attentive and responded to our request in a timely manner the room were clean and well stocked with fresh towel bath robe and bottled water the room steward came every evening to make sure we had fresh towel and to turn down the bed fresh fruit wa also delivered to the room the only issue we had wa we wanted the vacation over christmas but we were told that the hotel wa booked solid this wa not the case a there were plenty of vacant room available this wa a bit of a disappointment since we really wanted to be away during christmas it wa a pleasant surprise to meet m niranjala the hostess who wa also at heritance kandalama during our visit to that property in august and she recognized u and came over to chat it wa an enjoyable experience and a great vacation,2404,419,4.7398568019093075,4,0.9927,0.138,0.027,0.835,0.23105555555555563,0.46329914529914523

"We spent 10 nice days at the Heritance Ahungalla in april 2015. To summarize, the stay was in general a good one. The setting is wonderful indeed. Spectacular beach. Great weather. The hotel as such is not bad at all. However, given the fact that it is supposed to be on the upper end, and that is has been designated the title Travelers Choice, we expected a lot more. This is more like a mid-range family resort. The good: Wonderful surroundings, sea view from the balcony, tasteful spacious rooms with a well-regulated AC. Great breakfast. Pretty good food quality in general. Friendly service. The headwaiter acted very professionally and listen very carefully and arranged adjustments when we complained about the buffé dinner. The Bad: Dinner is a Buffé, served in an environment reminding you of an elementary school. Let us say - not very cozy. They brag about their fine dining restaurant, which serves excellent lobster (hence, you should go there once) at a quite high price, but the rest is nothing special. Expect €40-50 for a bottle of wine anywhere in the hotel. It is a family resort. Some days the pool area is crowed with screaming kinds, despite that pool rules say: NO GAMES. The staff does nothing to moderate. Between the hotel and the beach there is an area with palms and bushes. In the shade, a dozen or so sales men and women do their best to attract the attention of the guests all day long. Hello, hello! Our plane departed late so our travel agent suggested that we should ask for a late check out. Initially the response sounded as if that most likely could be arranged, but somehow the hotel was fully booked on the Monday morning when we should leave, so we had to leave the room and take the shower in a cramped public shower with no shower gel and no space to leave your belongings. That was the end of a glamorous holiday. Well, maybe not. Suggestions to management: 1. Dinner: Try to do something about the elementary school dining room. Serve the Buffé twice at 19 and then again at 20:30. Make sure that the food is fresh all the time. 2. Mixing families and couples: You have two pools. Why not enforce strict quiet behaviour at either pool and let the kids play at the other. Everyone will be happy. 3. Public showering facilities: It is warm. People are the for swimming. Make sure they can take a shower in a respectable bathroom before they say goodbye. It will be the last impression they take with them back home as they say Au revoir.",neutral,we spent nice day at the heritance ahungalla in april to summarize the stay wa in general a good one the setting is wonderful indeed spectacular beach great weather the hotel a such is not bad at all however given the fact that it is supposed to be on the upper end and that is ha been designated the title traveler choice we expected a lot more this is more like a midrange family resort the good wonderful surroundings sea view from the balcony tasteful spacious room with a wellregulated ac great breakfast pretty good food quality in general friendly service the headwaiter acted very professionally and listen very carefully and arranged adjustment when we complained about the buff dinner the bad dinner is a buff served in an environment reminding you of an elementary school let u say not very cozy they brag about their fine dining restaurant which serf excellent lobster hence you should go there once at a quite high price but the rest is nothing special expect for a bottle of wine anywhere in the hotel it is a family resort some day the pool area is crowed with screaming kind despite that pool rule say no game the staff doe nothing to moderate between the hotel and the beach there is an area with palm and bush in the shade a dozen or so sale men and woman do their best to attract the attention of the guest all day long hello hello our plane departed late so our travel agent suggested that we should ask for a late check out initially the response sounded a if that most likely could be arranged but somehow the hotel wa fully booked on the monday morning when we should leave so we had to leave the room and take the shower in a cramped public shower with no shower gel and no space to leave your belonging that wa the end of a glamorous holiday well maybe not suggestion to management dinner try to do something about the elementary school dining room serve the buff twice at and then again at make sure that the food is fresh all the time mixing family and couple you have two pool why not enforce strict quiet behaviour at either pool and let the kid play at the other everyone will be happy public showering facility it is warm people are the for swimming make sure they can take a shower in a respectable bathroom before they say goodbye it will be the last impression they take with them back home a they say au revoir,2480,445,4.575280898876405,6,0.993,0.147,0.047,0.806,0.280357501975149,0.5634861978979626

"Every so often even the mighty falter. What matters is recovery. After an impressive check-in, things went south at dinner. Inattentive service, cold food and total apathy left me wondering if this was the wrong place to spend three nights. I usually provide feedback at the end of my stay, but this bothered me enough that I penned an email to the corporate office that very evening. I did not expect a quick response. The next morning, with a fair amount of trepidation, I went for breakfast and was pleasantly surprised when a staff member approached me and apologized for the unpleasant experience the evening before. Before long another two managers stopped by to offer their apology. The balance of my stay was perfect. This property is beautiful. I was fortunate enough to get a room with an incredible view. The accommodations were comfortable and technologically up to date. The pool is huge and strategically located within 10 meters of the beach. I was on a half board plan and had the breakfast and dinner buffets during my stay. Good selection as well as taste. One of the days I ate lunch in one of the restaurants that offers a la carte service. I asked the chef to prepare lobster Sri Lankan style and it was absolutely delightful.

"Overall I would say this is a superb hotel and would definately recommend it to anyone wanting a relaxing place to stay. The hotel is very clean, the rooms are large and spacious and all the staff are very accomodating. The two infinity pools are lovely and the loungers around them can be moved in to the shade very easily or in to the sun when required. As we went off peak it was incredibly quiet and for 3 days there were only 2 couples around the second pool. The beds are very comfortable and the bathrooms well equipped with large showers and always immaculately clean. Breakfast was always very good with a huge range of food, with omlettes freshly cooked to order. Try the Egg Hoppers! Evening meals were available in the main restaurant generally tended to be from a set menu and were always a high standard - although the Sri Lankans tend to put two different dishes on one course. The Coffee Shop was also very good - you have to try Rice an Curry - a real treat. The Negative Points: On two occassions I sent food back only to have the original food returned........ the first was a chicken burger which I specifically requested to have no cheese on, it was returned with cold chips and the cheese scraped off - absolutely disgusting in my book and they were very apologetic about it. However the waiter spilt an orange juice over another plate of food and said he would get a fresh one, but when he returned the food was still soaked with OJ and underneath the salad there were remnants of the juice, so once again the plate had just been wiped down. I understand they were incredibly quiet but keeping costs down at the expense of the guest is not on. At weekends a lot of Sri Lankans tend to come and stay and the hotel becomes incredibly noisy. If you like early nights and peaceful sleeping I would definately recommend you request a room away from the main pool area. We arrived and were put in to a room facing the main pool and just on walking in the room knew it would be too noisy. We could still clearly hear the Fri and Sat night entertainment in our replacement room and Sat night there was really loud music on until midnight. If you value some peace ask for rooms at the far ends of the hotel. A word of warning regarding the beach hawkers...... unfortunately we had a bad experience with Emile De Silva, we arranged a couple of trips and an evening meal at the Sunshine Restaurant. Whilst the trips were 'ok' I felt crowded by having him, a driver and someone else join us (a trick for getting more money out of us by asking for bigger tips), they rushed us around the nice places and didn't really give us any space and didn't deliver on the glass bottomed boat, whilst still wanting the same money. The evening meal also never materialised with 2 different excuses given and then making us walk miles down the beach to another location which was actually on the road. We lost 1000 rupees as we refused to go as they had not told us earlier in the day there was a problem. Otherwise the other people on the beach were great, the ladies selling the 'sari's' were great fun and whilst they did try and call us over all the time they were lovely. Whilst the negative points above need to be considered, please don't let it put you off. The hotel was wonderful and all the staff would fall over themselves to help. It certainly looks by far the most superior hotel on that coastline. We have certainly agreed we will be returning in 2 years time. Tourism in Sri Lanka is desperately needed and when you spend your money you are treated like Kings.

"The hotel is very beautiful and has 2 pools, and spa facilities. One of the pools had a live entertainer playing some sort of traditional flute. The location of the hotel is convenient as it's directly next to the beach. We tried the massage and the spa facility, and it was very good, although a bit expensive when compared to other 5 star hotels in Sri Lanka. The rooms were tidy and well equipped. The bathroom is a bit small, but up to the standards. As with previous Heritance hotel we visited, the bottles of shampoo and shower gel need to be reviewed from an ergonomic point of view. They are difficult to pour from, either you pour too little or too much. On the down sides, the check-in process took around 30 to 40 minutes. Not sure why. The buffet was a disappointment. After all the great things we encountered in this hotel, we were looking forward to an amazing gastronomic experience. However the buffet was poor in terms of both variety and quality. We happened to be at the hotel on a full moon (Buddha Day), which is a holiday in Sri Lanka. Maybe that was the reason for the bad quality of the buffet, due to lack of staff? I'm not really sure.

"Had mixed feelings about the hotels. I was not bad but was never 5 star. The check in could have been done in a more pleasing manner. The staff was too harsh, not even with a proper smile on the face to welcome the guests. The much needed cold towels were not provided. We stayed in a standard room and is quite ok though three's nothing outstanding. The furniture was of good quality and the rooms had a prestigious look. We stayed in a tripple and the extra bed was a total disappointment. The mattress was terrible. The verandah of the room was nice and big. Toothbrushes, tooth pastes and a shaving kit was missing in the room. I had to give a few calls to get them to my room. there was central air conditioning with temperature control, but yet the temperature controller seemed not to work right. The bathroom was ok but could have been bit more large. The common areas of the second and the third floor was neither air conditioned nor had proper ventilation. So you can hardly relax on a sofa there. the food was good. had nice sea food. But need to have a few notches up to get it to 5 star level. The service was terrible. the staff is too harsh. No body has a smile on their face and you would have a real unpleasant situation. Those in the dining were ignorant of the guest's needs. During the dinner I had to ask five times to get a bottle of water. They take hours to prepare a new table. A really inefficient staff lacking the professionalism. The two pools were really good. both really large and well maintained. The green pool has a great privacy and is much better than the main one. That of course is 5 star.

"Weitläufige Hotelanlage mit vergleichsweise großen und schönen Pools. Im September (Nebensaison) war das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis sehr gut (DZ inkl. Frühstück für 80€). In der Hauptsaison (Winter) liegen die Preise des selben Zimmers bei 150€ bis 250€. Das ist meiner Ansicht nach überteuert. Die Anlage liegt direkt am ruhigen Strand von Ahungalla. Außerhalb des Hotels gibt es nicht viel zu tun, da es in Ahungalla keine wirkliche touristische Infrastruktur gibt. Wer aber Ruhe sucht, ist im Heritance gut aufgehoben. Die Außenanlage ist sehr gefpflegt und verfügt über einen großen und alten Baumbestand. Schön für Kinder: es haben sich immer wieder Affen blicken lassen und es gibt viele Streifenhörnchen und Krebse zu beobachten.

A lot of it's spicy, the beef's really tough. Delicious pineapple and papaya. There was no fish variety. Amateur salads. Ice cream liked it. They gave oysters once. The shrimp is delicious. The restaurant's not big. Wifi is weak. There are no TV channels in Russian. For all the faults, you can rest here well.

"Lovely looking hotel with a beautiful location. A few irritations though - no soap in the rooms, just two empty soap boxes in the bathroom bin! The boutique appeared to have exactly what I was looking for, but despite three trips to the shop and finding the ""open"" sign in the window, the door was locked and nobody was there. As we had to depart, I didn't have time to try to find someone. On arrival we had to remind the reception staff to give us back our passports. And there was extraordinarily loud drumming below our room for perhaps 45 minutes after dinner! We presumed there must have been some sort of cultural show on that we hadn't been told about. We were just starting to get really tired of it when it stopped. We had dinner in our room, and it was served quite promptly and was delicious. Breakfast was also delicious, with a great variety.

"We were there for two days ie 06 and 07 Dec. Let me objectively articulate the good thinga and things which needs improvement: Good ones 1. Well kept resort with private access to the beach 2. Huge open swimming pool which from the reception provides an illusion as if the pool is merging into the sea..a visual delight 3. Nice rooms with a balcony and I was told all rooms were sea facing Areas for improvement: 1. The access to the beach or otherwise ia uncontrolled ie no real security or barricade ..there were outsiders/ touts soliciting business and no one controlled them. 2. Most guests were Europeans and no wonder ..the entire menu was made to cater to their preferences barring a few local items 3. The menu for both dinner and breakfast practically remained unchanged thru our stay 4. Though the staff and chef were helpful, they probably had little clue about Indian dishes / ingredients/ taste. Despite their beat effort to provide one odd dish especially for us, the food experience was far from satisfactory. So if you are Indian and crave for Indian food ...this ia not the place for you. In contrast, all other places we stayed in SriLanka ie Kandy, Nuwara Eliya or Colombo, there were some Indian dishes on offer and some of them tasted good too. 4. Lastly , despite making a special request for cake/ flowers for our anniversary and reminding that very morning again, they messed it all up. Finally with the intervention of our travel agent they did bring a cake but by then the damage was done. It also gave me a feeling that they are probably still under slave mindset of licking the white skun.

"We travelled as a family and stayed in a deluxe suite, so had plenty of room. The furnishings in the room were a little dated, and the hotel as a whole could do with a revamp. There is a new luxury 5 star hotel being built next door, and I wondered whether the Heritance is gradually sliding to the rung below international luxury hotel, so as not to have direct competition. The food and service here were definitely substandard in comparison to the other hotels on our trip (Ulagalla, Anantaya and Jetwing Lighthouse and Yala), and our son ended up with food poisoning on our last evening, nearly delaying our return home. It was hard to get a table in the restaurant, and once seated it was hard to get the staff's attention for any drinks. The hotel was not very responsive to requests (we had problems with ants in the room, a lamp not working and a couple of other things) but the boy looking after our room was very attentive. Having said that, the hotel was very helpful about allowing us to use another room on the day of departure so that we could continue to use the facilities. I think there was a laundry issue: each time we asked for pool towels we were told there weren't any, but they did eventually materialise from a tumble dryer. Service at the pool bar was extremely erratic and inconsistent - we usually had to walk up to the bar to get attention. The stretch of beach by the hotel was lovely, and the currents not as strong as in some places, but still a risk for swimming. There was often entertainment on the beach, but two days after fireworks, the debris was still littering the beach. You have a great stretch of sand, don't ruin it! All in all, the hotel gives the impression of a gradual decline, which is a shame. Our room (at the very end of a corridor) was very quiet, but our friends stayed in a suite nearer to the main part of the hotel (329, I think) where you could hear all the entertainment all evening.",negative,we travelled a a family and stayed in a deluxe suite so had plenty of room the furnishing in the room were a little dated and the hotel a a whole could do with a revamp there is a new luxury star hotel being built next door and i wondered whether the heritance is gradually sliding to the rung below international luxury hotel so a not to have direct competition the food and service here were definitely substandard in comparison to the other hotel on our trip ulagalla anantaya and jetwing lighthouse and yala and our son ended up with food poisoning on our last evening nearly delaying our return home it wa hard to get a table in the restaurant and once seated it wa hard to get the staff attention for any drink the hotel wa not very responsive to request we had problem with ant in the room a lamp not working and a couple of other thing but the boy looking after our room wa very attentive having said that the hotel wa very helpful about allowing u to use another room on the day of departure so that we could continue to use the facility i think there wa a laundry issue each time we asked for pool towel we were told there werent any but they did eventually materialise from a tumble dryer service at the pool bar wa extremely erratic and inconsistent we usually had to walk up to the bar to get attention the stretch of beach by the hotel wa lovely and the current not a strong a in some place but still a risk for swimming there wa often entertainment on the beach but two day after firework the debris wa still littering the beach you have a great stretch of sand dont ruin it all in all the hotel give the impression of a gradual decline which is a shame our room at the very end of a corridor wa very quiet but our friend stayed in a suite nearer to the main part of the hotel i think where you could hear all the entertainment all evening,1942,362,4.367403314917127,2,0.9701,0.088,0.047,0.865,0.10642121212121212,0.4641818181818182

The food variety is magnificent the best I've seen out of the many hotels I've been to. I gave the 3 star rating just because how much i love the food and the creativity of the design in and outside the hotel.

"We travelled around Sri Lanka for 2 weeks staying in 6 different hotels, and this was by far the worst service we received out of our entire stay. The hotel itself is nice, rooms spacious and clean, pool area is nice. We dined in the a la carte restaurant which was nice. Don’t bother with half board / all inclusive - there’s a handful of restaurants on the beach with better food. The worst part is there seems to be some American expectation of tipping for absolutely everything, and if you don’t then you simply won’t get served!! Despite many signs around the pool saying sunbeds can’t be reserved, it seems the pool boy is more than happy to reserve these for a tip. I was up at 7:30am (jetlag), and there was just 1 set of sunbeds left despite no one actually being by the pool! We stayed there until midday, and some of the reserved beds only became occupied at 11am! So frustrating for everyone else. One woman took the reservation off and the pool boy flat out refused to give her a towel, even arguing with her! She went and got her own, and by midday no one had come to claim the bed! Awful! We went to the bar one night, they saw us walk in. They proceeded to offer every other group table service but us! I had to go to the bar 3 times for menus, drink etc., yet they still charged 10% service! On check-out you get shoved in some tiny room round back to pay your bill which is actually quite intimidating. No one asked if we had a nice stay or where we were going next, or even said bye when we left! While I do appreciate Sri Lanka is a poor country and tipping is needed, this was the only hotel during our whole trip that had this greedy mentality. We saved hard for this trip and don’t appreciate being treated like lesser people because we don’t have lots of extra money for tips! They also seem to have no problem in letting touts in to the hotel who come up to you on your sunbed to sell you a sari! I get that this happens on the beach but they shouldn’t allow them in the hotel grounds.",negative,we travelled around sri lanka for week staying in different hotel and this wa by far the worst service we received out of our entire stay the hotel itself is nice room spacious and clean pool area is nice we dined in the a la carte restaurant which wa nice dont bother with half board all inclusive there a handful of restaurant on the beach with better food the worst part is there seems to be some american expectation of tipping for absolutely everything and if you dont then you simply wont get served despite many sign around the pool saying sunbeds cant be reserved it seems the pool boy is more than happy to reserve these for a tip i wa up at am jetlag and there wa just set of sunbeds left despite no one actually being by the pool we stayed there until midday and some of the reserved bed only became occupied at am so frustrating for everyone else one woman took the reservation off and the pool boy flat out refused to give her a towel even arguing with her she went and got her own and by midday no one had come to claim the bed awful we went to the bar one night they saw u walk in they proceeded to offer every other group table service but u i had to go to the bar time for menu drink etc yet they still charged service on checkout you get shoved in some tiny room round back to pay your bill which is actually quite intimidating no one asked if we had a nice stay or where we were going next or even said bye when we left while i do appreciate sri lanka is a poor country and tipping is needed this wa the only hotel during our whole trip that had this greedy mentality we saved hard for this trip and dont appreciate being treated like lesser people because we dont have lot of extra money for tip they also seem to have no problem in letting tout in to the hotel who come up to you on your sunbed to sell you a sari i get that this happens on the beach but they shouldnt allow them in the hotel ground,2010,388,4.18298969072165,-1,-0.3945,0.082,0.091,0.827,0.042941337719298235,0.5655388471177946

"Our room at the hotel was very impressive but sadly quite noisy. You could hear everything from the corridors and in the room above. The hotel itself was a bit tired. The green swimming pool was amazing and usually quite quiet but the main pool was very busy all the time and with lots of children playing games so it was not very peaceful. The setting is lovely and the beach is really very beautiful, we enjoyed spending time on it. The staff were well meaning and friendly however we did have a few issues. I think perhaps not all of what we said/asked was understood but instead of asking to clarify they said yes and just said of course, no problem. This meant that we had a couple of situations which left us with problems. We booked a PCR test and expressly asked if the cost could be charged to our room. We were told that this was fine and no problem, then when we came to do the test we were told we needed to pay in cash which we did not have. The hotel did. It do anything to help and we found ourselves roaming the streets in the midday heat desperately trying to find a cash machine and very stressed. We also arranged a late check out which we had to pay for. We agreed this and then confirmed it the next day. Despite this on the day of check out we got a call saying we needed to vacate the room. We queried this and confirmed what we had arranged previously and were told they didn’t have anything on their system and we would need to clear our room straight away but they could put us in another room.

"This is a nice hotel. We generally enjoyed our stay, but qualified by the comment below. Special commendation for the hotel's service staff who were very helpful and pleasant. The qualification: The hotel website features photos of lovely views of the ocean from the hotel's main dining areas and pool. Moreover, we booked a ""premium"" room to enjoy the view of the beach and the ocean that comes with these rooms. A guest of the hotel should have a reasonable expectation that was is displayed on the website regarding visual amenity is what they will get if they book. However, for much of our stay, the hotel's beach-side amenity was marred by the construction and deconstruction (over four days) of a large marquee running the entire length of the hotel's main access way to the beach. This marquee does not appear in any photo on the hotel's website. Its presence, in my view, thus represents a breach, however minor, of the contract between hotel and guest. Because full-fee-paying hotel guests were not put first in this regard, it is unlikely that we will return to this hotel.",neutral,this is a nice hotel we generally enjoyed our stay but qualified by the comment below special commendation for the hotel service staff who were very helpful and pleasant the qualification the hotel website feature photo of lovely view of the ocean from the hotel main dining area and pool moreover we booked a premium room to enjoy the view of the beach and the ocean that come with these room a guest of the hotel should have a reasonable expectation that wa is displayed on the website regarding visual amenity is what they will get if they book however for much of our stay the hotel beachside amenity wa marred by the construction and deconstruction over four day of a large marquee running the entire length of the hotel main access way to the beach this marquee doe not appear in any photo on the hotel website it presence in my view thus represents a breach however minor of the contract between hotel and guest because fullfeepaying hotel guest were not put first in this regard it is unlikely that we will return to this hotel,1084,187,4.802139037433155,3,0.98,0.127,0.0,0.873,0.23165266106442578,0.49068627450980384

One girl poured water to the glass until its over flowed.. She apologised but ddnt have enough time to clean it for us she got occupied with something else.. I dont blame her, But the hotel management becauae it seemed like they were over worked the shifts.. Some of them were exhausted and unable to provide the service as expected by the guests paid for a pleasant dining time.. Poor service from taking away the finished plates to filling up the finished dishes.. Buffet was average in my opinion, food is good, considerable amount of variety was there.. but i hope they can improve a lil bit more when it comes to buffet and dining.. Apart from that the stay was satisfying.. We booked a premium delux room.. Which was spacious and clean.. But the bed was uncomfortable.. I expected for the bathrooms to be cleaner and more pleasant looking for a five start hotel.. Heard complaints from the guests in deluxe rooms.. So make sure to book higher rooms.. I recommend this hotel for a get away with avarage expectations.. Surely not upto five star standards specially compared to herritance kandalama.. The reception staff was very nice..

"Booked this hotel as part of our tour of sri lanka , it was the last one having stayed in 4 other hotels .Recommended to us and overall it was a nice hotel but let it self down in certain areas. Arrival was pleasant and we had a slight delay before going to the room , which was very nice spacious but in need of some improvements . wardrobe doors did not close on the runners , blinds in the bathroom had no function to close them , did report to reception but nothing done . Pool area very nice always able to get a sun lounger two pools available and the attendants were first class in providing towels and arranging the beds for you . Staff in the restaurants and bar areas were also first class being both attentive and professional. Only down side the evening was based around the pool and i feel they need to provide a better more comfortable seating arrangement instead of the same seating for the daytime pool drinking and eating tables and chairs . food and drink was good with a good choice and selection . beach is lovely but quiet due to , beach sellers and men pushing their taxi business which disrupts the relaxing environment , they stay behind a line of flags but it is close to the sun loungers. overall this is a nice hotel and nice beach side location nothing outside the resort if you go B+B then you must eat in the hotel which can work out expensive . The let down for us was the last day , most flights out of sri lanka are late evening , we were due to be collected at 21.30 . The room had to be vacated at 12.00 ( no late room available ). At 12.00 which was embarassing a member of the reception team came and cut off the all inclusive bands when we were with other guests. this is the first hotel which stopped the all inclusive many hours before we left . also if you want that shower prior to departing then they wont provide a room , we had to shower in the pool shower which is also the toilet nowhere to hang clothes or dry your hair . this was a disappointment to me which let the experience of the hotel down and which in my opinion stopped it being classed as a 5 Star , the sri lankan people were great i will return again but not to this hotel , i did read the reviews and thought i could ignore the beach sellers but it did spoil it . couple in our 40's",neutral,booked this hotel a part of our tour of sri lanka it wa the last one having stayed in other hotel recommended to u and overall it wa a nice hotel but let it self down in certain area arrival wa pleasant and we had a slight delay before going to the room which wa very nice spacious but in need of some improvement wardrobe door did not close on the runner blind in the bathroom had no function to close them did report to reception but nothing done pool area very nice always able to get a sun lounger two pool available and the attendant were first class in providing towel and arranging the bed for you staff in the restaurant and bar area were also first class being both attentive and professional only down side the evening wa based around the pool and i feel they need to provide a better more comfortable seating arrangement instead of the same seating for the daytime pool drinking and eating table and chair food and drink wa good with a good choice and selection beach is lovely but quiet due to beach seller and men pushing their taxi business which disrupts the relaxing environment they stay behind a line of flag but it is close to the sun lounger overall this is a nice hotel and nice beach side location nothing outside the resort if you go bb then you must eat in the hotel which can work out expensive the let down for u wa the last day most flight out of sri lanka are late evening we were due to be collected at the room had to be vacated at no late room available at which wa embarassing a member of the reception team came and cut off the all inclusive band when we were with other guest this is the first hotel which stopped the all inclusive many hour before we left also if you want that shower prior to departing then they wont provide a room we had to shower in the pool shower which is also the toilet nowhere to hang clothes or dry your hair this wa a disappointment to me which let the experience of the hotel down and which in my opinion stopped it being classed a a star the sri lankan people were great i will return again but not to this hotel i did read the review and thought i could ignore the beach seller but it did spoil it couple in our s,2293,451,4.086474501108648,5,0.9917,0.121,0.045,0.833,0.17837460317460319,0.4705396825396825

We stayed for a week in January and to be honest the hotel was ok, the staff were great and the setting beautiful. But I have to buck the trend of good reviews because to be honest the food was average at best. As mentioned above my wife and I have visited Sri Lanka many times without any issues. But unfortunately by the second night my wife and I came down with severe diarrhoea and stomach cramps which lasted the whole week.

"I am surprised at the number of glowing reviews this hotel has received. Either my wife and I were unlucky, too hard to impress, or other reviewers for this hotel were being too kind. Ill start with the positives. The hotel grounds are very nice, the pool is excellent, the location right on the beach very nice. The rooms are ok, they have everything you might expect or want. Nothing more or less. However this hotel seems to follow the usual business model you find in these types of regions. Hire the cheapest staff you can find, provide only the basic training, charge the guests international rates, make a fortune on high margins. Staff were slow and spoke very little english. They cannot engage in conversation which is frustrating when you need to ask about the local area, request extra food items, or anything you might require. There was no imagination, such beautiful grounds yet no outdoor BBQ for guests during the day or night, outdoor pool bar, or even music. And then there is the idea of apparent supplementation of hotel income by allowing corporate/local guests in with their families in tow on weekends. About 20 screaming kids in the pool and all the deck chairs taken forcing guests like myself to retreat somewhere else. I just dont expect this at a hotel that wants be considered in the luxurious category. Food was overpriced for the quality. It was fine, just not what you would expect for the price. Staff would take away an empty bottle and just fail to ask if you wanted another. Basic stuff. Staff are just in a constant state of apathy. I found myself having to look for the barman, find the guy to bring my wife and I the towels for the pool area. They were just never where you wanted them to be. When you did they were slow and emotionless. And the hawkers waiting outside the hotel limits on the beach. I mean that put me off straight away. We couldnt go anywhere without being accosted by these people. If I want a poorly made garment Ill go the street market myself thanks. Other guests actually hesitated walking on to the beautiful beach just so they didnt have to interact with these people. How is that fair? Upon checkout, my wife and I sat in the lobby area for 35 minutes as we waited for our driver and werent offered a single beverage/refreshment. Guess once you check out you arent worth the time anymore? Given so many of us only have only a few weeks a year allotted for holidays due to work commitments, its heartbreaking not getting what you think you are paying for. I think the Heritance Ahungalla has become complacent due to all the kind reveiws. When compared to the surrounding area it is 5 star quality, but internationally its 3 star at best. Its not a bad hotel at all, just not that great. Therefore I gave it an ""average"" rating as its simply average. UPDATE: We have just checked in to the Fortress in Galle and it makes the Heritance look even worse. I wish we hadnt bothered with Ahungalla at all now. Im sure Ill get some half-hearted response from the management regarding my critique as they have done to others.

Staff were friendly but overall service needs to improve. They lacked energy and interests. Across the hotel we felt there was some sense of boredom.

We had paid for an upgrade on our room prior to leaving the UK with a double bed deluxe sea view. We got neither. Room was damp with a smell of urine from the bathroom. Interior was again dark with numerous scratches on furniture. No ocean view and two twin beds put together and the safe was not secure to anything!!!!! Tiles missing from the bathroom and no kettle,ironing board and iron!! The list is endless.

"The hotel is generally good. I was informed that it had been hit by the tsunami in 2004 and all the ground floor rooms were submerged.

However, my friends who were in standards rooms didn't like their stay at all. They complained about the rooms having flying cockroaches. The culinary experience was not as great as I hoped considering the hotel was voted as being the Best in Culinary Experience in Sri Lanka. Maybe because I was comparing with Hilton Colombo where I had just come from and which I would rate as better. The gym was ok but the electic equipment such as treadmills and cross trainers could use an upgrade. The gym is open throughout i.e. it's never locked which is great for flexibility.

"I have such mixed feelings about this hotel but I’m confident in saying that this is not up to the standards of a 5 star. We stopped here for the last week of our 2 week trip to Sri Lanka for our honeymoon and on arrival to the hotel from the lobby/main gates it looked exceptional! On arrival to our “deluxe” room we were instantly disappointed. The room apparently had just been refurbished which I found really hard to believe. The shower was covered in limescale and the room was tiny. After a bit of a battle we were finally allocated another room. This room was slightly bigger but the bathroom was once again the bathroom was again covered in limescale, half decorated, very basic and we couldn’t see anything deluxe or 5 star about it. Earlier in the week we stayed in a deluxe room at a sister hotel ‘Heritance Kandalama’ and the room there had an amazing view, whirlpool bath & amazing decor… so as you can imagine we were really disappointed with this room. I’ve attached a couple of photos for reference too. The food was really really good at the buffet and snack bar and we thought the verity of alcohol provided on the all inclusive was good.

"When entering the hotel all the guests and bag are being checked by secirity personnels and metal detectors which is a good move to reassure safety. Valet parking is available. We were warmly welcomed and the reception was very busy atthe time we were checking-in. We were offered a welcome drink and a small snack as well as a refreshing face towel. The garden was neat and the lobby area was quite large and spacious. Furniture and the decor was modernised vintage looking. The room was looking so inviting and the lighting did its magic with the look of a lavishly renovated early bunglow. The bed was comfortable and so were the sheets and pillows. The view from our room was partially to the ocean and eventhough it was not directly centered at the ocean, the view of the sea from our room was spectacular. The food was on a buffet set-up and all of what I tried was delicious. Yet, I believe that the variety could have been improved, specially the breakfast service. On the other hand, the dinner was excellent! However, the lunch might not be the best buffets of Heritance Ahungalla I suppose. The buffet quality might be pressed down as a result of low rates being charged in this season to attarct more guests to the hotel. Moreover, the spa was relaxing and the therapists did their part well. Above all, the fragrance in the spa was fantastic. Unfortunately, we had a bad night. After having dinner, a function started at the hotel and we guessed that it was in the lobby area. It was extremely loud and we could not relax in the balcony or sleep inside. I am sure a manager or some authoritative personnel could have made a change in the location of the function. I understand that it was raining in the evening but the hotel might have a certain policy in terms of having functions at the hotel. There is ample space in the property and there might be a better place or a separate place to have functions. So, please make sure that such problems do not occur in the future.

As we are a large family, the benefit of the luxury suites 2 bathrooms would have been great. Unfortunately there were no luxury suites available when we arrived. Our room was clean and comfortable. We did notice the shower/bath combo would not drain properly and also collected a lot of water on the tubs edges which would spill onto the floor. We made do with towels placed in strategic locations. The food was very good and we absolutely loved the huge swimming pool. We even swam during a thunder shower. The location served as a great base to see all of the other sites Sri Lanka had to offer. Every staff member from the waiters, to the lifeguards, to the lovely gift shop employee was fantastic.

The place was nice with beautiful views. The food was good but overpriced. Also the service was slow in the cafe. I think it was too expensive for the place and to charge almost 3500 lkr for a dinner buffet that had a great salad & dessert bar but the main foods was very limited. I am pretty sure they do not have generators because when the power was out there was backup current. I would recommend that you take a walk down to the beach and take a right to white villa restaurant or take a left to Jungle beach to eat.

"We recently stayed here for two weeks and have to say had a great time. The hotel and grounds are lovely. It is right on the beach front which is beautiful. I can only comment on the room we had which was a deluxe room with partial sea view. The only reason it states partial is because there are palm trees and bushes between the room and view but it was lovely all the same. The room was spacious and had everything we needed. Lovely basket of fruit on arrival which was refreshed in the second week. Bottled water Daily and a mini fridge full of soft drinks, alcohol, crisps and chocolate. Rooms were cleaned daily and beds turned down each night, fresh towels twice a day. Lovely towel art left each day. The room cleaners really are a credit to the hotel. Although I have to say all the staff are a credit. All very helpful and pleased to help. Food was amazing. We were on an all inclusive basis which we wouldn’t normally do but would recommend as not much nearby outside of the hotel. Great selection of meals all day. Have to say we were in curry heaven. Good selection for non curry eaters! Many reviews say Diet Coke isn’t included in your drinks package which concerned me being diabetic, however they actually have Coke Zero which is included. Wine is only served at meal times in the A.I. Package. Two great pools in the grounds, we spent our time by the quiet pool. Bars were good but we spent most of our time at the pool bar were most of the entertainment was in the evenings. Some of the shows a bit bizarre but that’s A.I. for you. The days spent on the sun beds were filled with sightings of monitor lizards, chipmunk type creatures and monkeys roaming the grounds. Whilst here make sure you get out and about there is so much to see. We used a local guide who was a fraction of the price of tui who we travelled with. Found him prior to going and booked all our trips via him before going, didn’t require payment until we arrived and met him personally.There are lots of local guides inc ones on the beach and the money stays local. *** Try Charu of czarek tours *** you can find him on Facebook or at charukadesilva5@gmail.com Also don’t listen to tui when they say you have to use your rupees up before the airport or exchange what you have left in the departure lounge prior to going through security. You can spend them in the airport!! Finally we would like to thank all the staff at the Heritance for making our holiday so special.

"We booked for 2 nights unexpectedly as the election curfew messed with our original plans. The resort was mostly empty. It's not a full all-inclusive, meaning some guests pay a la carte. For the all-inclusive, the selection is OK - local spirits and a short list of cocktails. Wine is only served in the restaurant at lunch and dinner, which is weird. Food was good, but couldn't help the feeling that because it was not fully occupied the choice wasn't all there. The pool is nice, the beach is nearby (but not really a great beach, some serious surf). Rooms were OK, very clean, wifi was fast and the overall experience positive.

"We've just returned from our honeymoon - a week in the Maldives(paradise) followed by a week in Sri Lanka staying in the Heritance Ahungalla. The hotel is beautiful just like any hotel in a major city let it be London, Dublin or New York so if its traditional Sri Lankan style your looking for than its not for you. Our room was looking out onto the ocean however the water was unfortunately too rough for swimming. There wasn't a soul on the beach for the entire duration of our trip apart from the usual hawkers who camp out on the beach for the day in the hope of selling the odd sarong or two. The food was nice but became extremely repetitive when your there for 6 days, bearing in mind there's nothing outside the hotel so no chance of eating anywhere else. If you like a drink and a bit of a buzz at nite then this is also not the hotel for you, the bars have no atmosphere.Your not encouraged to go out of the hotel however saying that there's nothing to go out for in the line of entertainment, shopping or eating just a little shop across the road which sells water and snacks which may come in handy as hotels prices are the same if not even more expenive than home. Once you walk out of the hotel you'll be surrounded by hawkers trying to sell you tours which can be annoying as they're fairly persistent. We went on a local tour by tuk tuk with Raji who camps out outside the hotel or beach, his English is perfect which helps. This was quite enjoyable apart from being brought to two different shops trying to get us to buy stuff, this is standard procedure if u take a tuk tuk anyway. We did the nearby river safari which we booked through our travel rep. This would be very managable and much cheaper to do by travelling by tuk tuk and hopping on a boat when you get there, just a few mins down the road. We also went to a national park spotting elephants, about 9 hrs in a car but enjoyable all the same.All of the staff in the hotel were outstanding very friendly and pleasant. Sri Lanka is really just a country for touring around, the ideal would be 4 or 5 days seeing the sights staying in a different hotel ever nite.

"The sign next to reception says the hotel was voted the best 5 star hotel in Sri Lanka in 2010. If it's true then I just wonder what the rest must be like ! The original standard room was appalling and after complaining we were upgraded to a deluxe room which was good. All public areas are in need of refurbishment and there is a lack of any serious evening entertainment. Alcoholic drinks are some of the most expensive I have come across, either in Europe, Asia or the USA. The dinner experience in the Jute restaurant is mediocre, unless you like curry. It's a buffet and nothing is really hot. There appears to be a problem with the extractor fans and as the breakfast is cooked in the restaurant there is always a cloud of smoke circulating in the mornings.The room has a low ceiling and the decor is dark. The are two nice pools but the tiling around the edges is very uneven and loose. The beach is long and pleasant but the irritating, aggressive beach hawkers who stand ten metres away shouting to attract the attention of the guests make life unpleasant, they are a major problem. The beach has a lot of debris strewn about , bottles, polystyrene etc, but the management claim it is the job of the local council to clear it. As a previous poster has said, there is nothing close to the hotel and very little to do. For $150 per night it would be reasonable, but for the $300 per night ( b&b) we paid it is way overpriced.

"Having stayed at this hotel around 8 or 9 times over the last 20 years, we returned with high expectations. I am pleased to be able to say that the actual experience exceeded our expectations. We were given a large room on the top floor, well away from the restaurants and other potential sources of noise. The room was furnished beautifully and the bed was very comfortable. Everything was squeaky-clean and kept that way by our room boy, who also replenished our fruit bowl regularly. The hotel has a superb location at the end of a long beach and we were pleased to find that you can still stroll along its full extent without meeting more than a handful of people. There are two pools and plenty of sunbeds in the extensive garden area, where you can watch the many birds and chipmunks as well as the occasional monitor lizard passing through. We enjoyed the food, particularly the excellent dinner arranged for us by the head chef. The weather during our stay was pretty mixed, but we managed a few dinners at the seafood station by the side of the pool. I would recommend both the food and the relaxed atmosphere there.There is also a small covered 'open-air' restaurant area, where we had some good curries. Breakfast is a sumptuous affair with a wide range of choices, including hoppers and curries as well as the more traditional European-style offerings. There is also a splendid selection of fruit and juices. Whilst the hotel and its facilities are very good indeed, it was the friendliness and efficiency of the staff which really made our stay memorable. We were constantly surprised by the way in which people anticipated our wishes/preferences and provided what we were looking for - and much more - without ever having to ask for it. Truly exceptional service and hospitality! There were many familiar faces amongst the staff and we were also pleased to find that Eranda, our favourite tuk-tuk driver, was still offering his services by the gate. We have used him on many occasions and have found him very accommodating and utterly reliable. Resort areas such as Bentota and Hikkaduwa are within easy reach by tuk-tuk. We even went as far as Unawatuna this time - and enjoyed a 'roti lunch' with Eranda in Galle on the way. (Without him we would have struggled to order anything.) As the title above suggests, we have no complaints whatsoever. We only regretted not being able to stay longer. However, we will certainly try to come back.",positive,having stayed at this hotel around or time over the last year we returned with high expectation i am pleased to be able to say that the actual experience exceeded our expectation we were given a large room on the top floor well away from the restaurant and other potential source of noise the room wa furnished beautifully and the bed wa very comfortable everything wa squeakyclean and kept that way by our room boy who also replenished our fruit bowl regularly the hotel ha a superb location at the end of a long beach and we were pleased to find that you can still stroll along it full extent without meeting more than a handful of people there are two pool and plenty of sunbeds in the extensive garden area where you can watch the many bird and chipmunk a well a the occasional monitor lizard passing through we enjoyed the food particularly the excellent dinner arranged for u by the head chef the weather during our stay wa pretty mixed but we managed a few dinner at the seafood station by the side of the pool i would recommend both the food and the relaxed atmosphere therethere is also a small covered openair restaurant area where we had some good curry breakfast is a sumptuous affair with a wide range of choice including hopper and curry a well a the more traditional europeanstyle offering there is also a splendid selection of fruit and juice whilst the hotel and it facility are very good indeed it wa the friendliness and efficiency of the staff which really made our stay memorable we were constantly surprised by the way in which people anticipated our wishespreferences and provided what we were looking for and much more without ever having to ask for it truly exceptional service and hospitality there were many familiar face amongst the staff and we were also pleased to find that eranda our favourite tuktuk driver wa still offering his service by the gate we have used him on many occasion and have found him very accommodating and utterly reliable resort area such a bentota and hikkaduwa are within easy reach by tuktuk we even went a far a unawatuna this time and enjoyed a roti lunch with eranda in galle on the way without him we would have struggled to order anything a the title above suggests we have no complaint whatsoever we only regretted not being able to stay longer however we will certainly try to come back,2454,427,4.749414519906323,6,0.9965,0.161,0.013,0.825,0.30538185085354896,0.597426221577165

"We stayed at this hotel for twelve days and expected more from a hotel with a deluxe reputation. The greatest asset this hotel has are its staff. They were simply excellent, so very friendly, exceptionally eager to please and polite and courteous at all times. You would find it difficult to find a better hotel staff anywhere. The food in the buffet restaurant was of a high standard and a perfect mix of Sri Lankan and International dishes. The food in the fine dining restaurant was even better and probably better than manyy top restaurants in London. The hotel is located right on the beach andmost of the rooms have a great sea view. There are many beach venders, but we did not find this too much a problem as they quickly learnt not to bother you once you made it clear you were not interested. Yes, there are many positives to this hotel, but unfortunately it does not deserve a deluxe rating. First impression are so important and this hotel is let down by being in need of care and attention. For example the furnishings in the public areas were stained and needed replacing and much of the woodwork needed attention. The tablecloths in the dining room were frequently filthy (unacceptable and easily rectified) and all the linen needed to be renewed. Many of the sunbeds were broken and needed replacing and wer covered with dirty matresses. However, the pool attendents were excellent and helped to make up for these problems. Our overall impression of this hotel was that it required significant investment to bring it up to an acceptable standard for a deluxe hotel. The hotel is saved by its excellent staff and fabulous food; two of the most impotant factors for a successful hotel. Would we return, possibly, but only if standards were improved. There are many boutique hotels opening in Sri Lanka and the Heritance needs to be able to match the very high standard that these hotels set.",negative,we stayed at this hotel for twelve day and expected more from a hotel with a deluxe reputation the greatest asset this hotel ha are it staff they were simply excellent so very friendly exceptionally eager to please and polite and courteous at all time you would find it difficult to find a better hotel staff anywhere the food in the buffet restaurant wa of a high standard and a perfect mix of sri lankan and international dish the food in the fine dining restaurant wa even better and probably better than manyy top restaurant in london the hotel is located right on the beach andmost of the room have a great sea view there are many beach vender but we did not find this too much a problem a they quickly learnt not to bother you once you made it clear you were not interested yes there are many positive to this hotel but unfortunately it doe not deserve a deluxe rating first impression are so important and this hotel is let down by being in need of care and attention for example the furnishing in the public area were stained and needed replacing and much of the woodwork needed attention the tablecloth in the dining room were frequently filthy unacceptable and easily rectified and all the linen needed to be renewed many of the sunbeds were broken and needed replacing and wer covered with dirty matresses however the pool attendents were excellent and helped to make up for these problem our overall impression of this hotel wa that it required significant investment to bring it up to an acceptable standard for a deluxe hotel the hotel is saved by it excellent staff and fabulous food two of the most impotant factor for a successful hotel would we return possibly but only if standard were improved there are many boutique hotel opening in sri lanka and the heritance need to be able to match the very high standard that these hotel set,1905,333,4.723723723723723,3,0.9934,0.207,0.073,0.72,0.3053897873614854,0.6176088649296194
"Well, if you like a large noisy hotel with shabby rooms and indifferent food, then this is the place for you. On the plus side the beach is pristine, and the inexperienced staff try their best.

The rooms are decorated in the bare plaster look which does not stand up to wear and tear. The food is average if you like buffets at specific times.

"We stayed for two weeks at the end of September after the hotel was highly recommended to us by a friend. From the moment we arrived we were treated to a true five star experience. Our room was a deluxe room overlooking the Green Pool with a view of the sea and we couldn't have asked for better. The bathroom had double sinks and the bed was better than our one at home. The buffet food was always fresh and inspiring and the chefs would always cook some plain chicken for my fussy 6 year old daughter. The restaurant staff, even when really busy, were always smiling and attentive. We were especially impressed by KK (Kumara) who went out of his way to make our family holiday incredible. He is a credit to the hotel as well as his colleague Thusara, who also looked after us. The bar staff were great, as were the canapés served with our delicious arrack. The pools were lovely to swim in, especially the Green Pool. We would thoroughly recommend this hotel, even though it's large it has the personal feel of a smaller hotel. It's also worth mentioning that we booked the hotel with Imthiyaz at Sun City Travels in Colombo and he got us a very good rate for our stay. We would like to thank all the staff for their fantastic efforts in making our holiday so amazing. My daughter says she would give the hotel 10 stars if she was allowed.

"The hotel is old but well maintained. Garden is wonderful and night lighting also. With regards to the food and beverage, the buffet is ok without any plus. The chefs are very helpful. Buffet conditions are poor, chafing dishes are broken, salad buffet is basic. The Sri Lankan corner is quiet repetitive. Breakfast was up to standard, except the scrambled eggs. Service during breakfast needs to be looked after, as we waited 10 minutes before we were asked for our beverages. Pool bar : Beverage choice ok, but service is not a 5 star and cocktails quality is not up to what expected. Check in was very long but friendly and professional. One major point that the management needs to tackle is the beach boys and all souvenir boys that literally bother you once you go on the beach. Over all good stay, but certainly not at 5 star level.

"This is meant to be a 5 star hotel, but is lacking in so many areas. The positives first. The restaurant staff and room cleaning staff were excellent. The rooms are very nice, spacious and beds are extremely comfortable. Unfortunately the reception staff and management were extremely unhelpful and didn’t address issues when highlighted. We visited during Sri Lankan new year and we knew shops and restaurants would be closed, we asked the reception staff and were advised Fri and sat (which is what we expected) I also asked if they knew if restaurants in Galle would be open on the Sunday and was advised they would all be closed as still new year so better to stay at the hotel. This was incorrect as a discovered through a Facebook forum and visited Galle on the Sunday were all restaurants were open. This felt like an attempt to keep you in the hotel spending money. The prices at the hotel were also questionable. The hotel we stayed in the week before had clear pricing on there menu eg Nani goreng 1800 Sri Lankan rupees. The heritance menu do 10% state service charge to be added, but also to be added is 18% vat meaning the prices stated which were already at least 20% higher than the previous 5star rated hotel we had stayed in were much more costly than other similarly rated hotels and more concerningly this isn’t clear. The pools open at 8am which is fine as they need to clean them, but the bed cover and towels aren’t available until 8am and as I am an early riser and like to get up and spend some time in the sun before breakfast and the sun gets too hot this was disappointing. Also out of the 5 nights we stayed here I had to trek around the resort on 3 separate days to find a pool attendant as you can’t get the mattress and towels yourself, having gone to reception on 2 occasions it took until 9 am on 2 of the days to get the towels and mattresses, and all the manager Clive could do was apologise, which given it happened again the following morning was very poor. The issue clearly hadn’t been addressed. Also around the pool, wasn’t cleaned with cigarette ends (dissapointing that’s scruffy guests leave this is the first place) plastic bottles and beer caps left on the grass for the last 4 days we were there. I would not recommend this hotel to stay at and instead would highly recommend the 5 star Taj Bentota which is only 20 minutes away and is excellent with much more around the hotel as well which if you want to explore is great.",negative,this is meant to be a star hotel but is lacking in so many area the positive first the restaurant staff and room cleaning staff were excellent the room are very nice spacious and bed are extremely comfortable unfortunately the reception staff and management were extremely unhelpful and didnt address issue when highlighted we visited during sri lankan new year and we knew shop and restaurant would be closed we asked the reception staff and were advised fri and sat which is what we expected i also asked if they knew if restaurant in galle would be open on the sunday and wa advised they would all be closed a still new year so better to stay at the hotel this wa incorrect a a discovered through a facebook forum and visited galle on the sunday were all restaurant were open this felt like an attempt to keep you in the hotel spending money the price at the hotel were also questionable the hotel we stayed in the week before had clear pricing on there menu eg nani goreng sri lankan rupee the heritance menu do state service charge to be added but also to be added is vat meaning the price stated which were already at least higher than the previous star rated hotel we had stayed in were much more costly than other similarly rated hotel and more concerningly this isnt clear the pool open at am which is fine a they need to clean them but the bed cover and towel arent available until am and a i am an early riser and like to get up and spend some time in the sun before breakfast and the sun get too hot this wa disappointing also out of the night we stayed here i had to trek around the resort on separate day to find a pool attendant a you cant get the mattress and towel yourself having gone to reception on occasion it took until am on of the day to get the towel and mattress and all the manager clive could do wa apologise which given it happened again the following morning wa very poor the issue clearly hadnt been addressed also around the pool wasnt cleaned with cigarette end dissapointing thats scruffy guest leave this is the first place plastic bottle and beer cap left on the grass for the last day we were there i would not recommend this hotel to stay at and instead would highly recommend the star taj bentota which is only minute away and is excellent with much more around the hotel a well which if you want to explore is great,2471,456,4.421052631578948,3,0.9943,0.131,0.041,0.828,0.1490771349862259,0.5239566115702479

"Overall we were disappointed with this hotel compared to others we stayed in during our trip to Sri Lanka. The room was tired and badly needing updated, things like seeing the same room service plates still outside the same room door hours later was unhygienic and attracted bugs. The food, we were half board so ate at the buffet breakfast and dinner. I really struggled as at dinner there was only a variety of curries available and being pregnant and adverse to certain smells I couldn’t even go up to see what was available. However the staff were fantastic at dealing with this for me and I honestly couldn’t have been in better hands. I really did appreciate their efforts in ensuring I ate a proper meal once they realised I was struggling. The pools were easily the best pools we had access to during our trip, we spent a lot more time using these facilities than we did anywhere else. One of the things I disliked was being shouted at from behind the chain link fence to come and see what the locals were selling but they’re not on hotel property so I understand there isn’t anything staff can do about them. We were on our honeymoon and our tour operator had told us in our itinerary to bring our marriage certificate in order to receive honeymoon benefits.

"It was an overall disappointing stay at Heritance Ahungalla. The hotel was fully booked during our stay, given the holiday season. The hotel staff was very nice and friendly. It is an old building and definitely needs maintenance, particularly the rooms. For a 5-star property, the room is small, and the toilet hardly has any space in it, which is not what you'd expect given the star category this hotel boasts about and when compared to other similar 5-star hotels and resorts in Sri Lanka. The quality of the extra bed in the triple room would possibly befit a 2 or 3 star hotel. On the other hand, the king bed in the room was very comfortable, and one of the pluses was the sea view from the room, which was amazing. The food lacked variety and if you are a vegetarian, stay away from Heritance Ahungalla. They simply don't cater to those needs, even if you make a special note of it. The lunch buffet was the worst of the three meals we had. This was brought to the attention of the chef and the restaurant manager, and they were most apologetic, but it was an overall bitter experience in the end at Heritance Ahungalla.

"Though it's described as a five-star resort, my parents and I were sorely disappointed by this hotel and will not be returning. The cons: 1. The receptionist offered us the opportunity to upgrade to full-board or half-board at a discount (USD30 instead of USD25 per meal). When we asked which restaurants this was applicable for, they said that it was only for the main restaurant, but failed to mention that it was ONLY valid for the buffet. If we had known, we wouldn't have signed up for two days of buffet-only meals. We found out because the waiter told us we couldn't have ala carte, and all of this happened after we'd paid for half-board for two days. In addition to not being told exactly what we were paying for, we discovered that the buffer cost LKR3,700 (USD24.2). So you're telling me that I didn't receive a discount--I'm actually paying the full cost of the buffet AND I'm locked in for a two-day commitment. This was dishonest on the hotel's part, and according to our travel agent, they shouldn't be directly giving us discounts--they're supposed to go through the agent. All in all, very poor form on the hotel's part. 2. On the morning of our check-out date, my bathroom didn't have water. I couldn't use the sink, I couldn't shower; it's a good thing I didn't have to flush anything. I checked my dad's room next door - also no water. It took two calls for housekeeping for the water to come back. How is this acceptable? 3. Our room had an odd smell that came from the bathroom drain. When we told the GRO, she said housekeeping would be around shortly to attend to it. They arrived 18 hours later. 4. When we first arrived, there was no porter to be found and we waited a solid few minutes before the receptionist noticed that we wanted to check in with our bags. He then rushed out and seemed very frazzled. Out of the 7 hotels we stayed in Sri Lanka, this was by far the poorest reception we'd received. The pros: 1. The restaurant staff were lovely, warm and attentive. My mum had a broken arm on this trip and the chef himself came out and helped her take food for the buffet and then walked her to her table. 2. They provide comfortable flip flops for guests to use on the beach and around the property. 3. The food was delicious.

"We stayed from 18 to 21 January with a group of 13 family members. This was the second hotel in the Heritance group we stayed at during our 23 day holiday in Sri Lanka. Compared to Heritance Kandalama Ahungalla was a real disappointment. It looks great when you first arrive - the pool looks fantastic but everything else about it was disappointing - the tiles in the foyer area and along the corridors are stained, the bathrooms need a really good scrub, the food in the buffets was boring and many of the staff looked like they just didn't want to be there. Overall there just didn't seem to be the attention to detail we saw at Kandalama - we booked 3 double rooms, 2 twins and one triple room. On arrival the 3 doubles were all made up as twins and the triple had only 2 beds. One of the couples called reception on arrival to have the beds remade as a a double and had no problems, the second called and was told that it was not their practice to do that and in order to have a double bed the couple would have to be moved and that couldn't happen at the time because the hotel was full, the third couple then rang and was upgraded to a better room, despite the previous couple being told that there were no other rooms at all. In the triple room a small fold out bed was provided and most of the first evening was spent trying to explain to the staff that the tiny bed was not large enough for a teenage boy. Eventually after much conversation a better bed was provided. My parents have visited this hotel 4 times, however I would not go there again. In its current condition it is not worth the price charged.",negative,we stayed from to january with a group of family member this wa the second hotel in the heritance group we stayed at during our day holiday in sri lanka compared to heritance kandalama ahungalla wa a real disappointment it look great when you first arrive the pool look fantastic but everything else about it wa disappointing the tile in the foyer area and along the corridor are stained the bathroom need a really good scrub the food in the buffet wa boring and many of the staff looked like they just didnt want to be there overall there just didnt seem to be the attention to detail we saw at kandalama we booked double room twin and one triple room on arrival the double were all made up a twin and the triple had only bed one of the couple called reception on arrival to have the bed remade a a a double and had no problem the second called and wa told that it wa not their practice to do that and in order to have a double bed the couple would have to be moved and that couldnt happen at the time because the hotel wa full the third couple then rang and wa upgraded to a better room despite the previous couple being told that there were no other room at all in the triple room a small fold out bed wa provided and most of the first evening wa spent trying to explain to the staff that the tiny bed wa not large enough for a teenage boy eventually after much conversation a better bed wa provided my parent have visited this hotel time however i would not go there again in it current condition it is not worth the price charged,1616,309,4.233009708737864,0,0.844,0.074,0.053,0.874,0.05433407738095238,0.3730282738095238

"Checked into hotel Mid August into a luxury room and I would highly reccomend paying that little bit extra as the rooms are huge! And you get a bath tub that overlooks the pool.. but no one can see in as there is mesh stopping.. so its very private! On arrival sat down with a welcome drink (Pineapple or Wood Apple juice) as we came early from Colombo around 11am and room was not ready.. but that did not bother me as they advised full occupancy in hotel before we came and cannot get early check in which was ok because My partner and I sat in the bar and had a few drinks.. they came to us and gave the key instead of us going to reception.... Went to our room! and I thought it was very very clean.. the bed was so comfy... In the luxury rooms there is no ceiling fan tho, but you have an aircon which gets cool in the nights ... Room was cleaned every morning and evening.. fresh towels and bathrobes... Both pools were good but i prefered the private pool the best! & it had a spa you can use from certain hours and relaxing!! I used the Coco Spa and got a sweedish massage and it was the most relaxing thing, and was very professional as they drape you properly with the towels and do an amazing job.. they are Balinese ladies and very lovely and do a great job! My husband got one the following day! Food in the resturant was beautiful... you can get your Sri Lankan curries or you can get Bbq night.. prawns.. lots of salad to choose from... & soups.. my favourite was the deserts.. so lovely ... Staff and chefs were nice! overall i would stay here again.. beach is too rough to swim though which is dissappointing.. as im from Australia .. i love the beaches.. I reccomend seing Hikkaduwa and the huge turtles you can swim with..

When we were eating the most delicious "" appoms"" with our fingers , Kusum was there with a finger bowl for our messy fingers 😄....even before we could ask for one . He remembers little details like the hot tea that we always end our meals with and brings it to us even without us asking , just at the right time ... Kusum always had a beautiful smile for everyone at the restaurant . Chef Roshan was another person who impressed us , he heard that we were eager to eat a certain type of fish and he took the trouble to check with his kitchen staff to see if he had the fish as he wanted to cook it specially for us .

The hotel looks stunning offers great views.We had booked the premium rooms sea facing. We found the service lacking in all aspects.From the rooms check in to the restaurant service. We were quite displeased with the hotel. I had planned a surprise for my husband and had requested the hotel for a cake and for the room to be decorated and offered to pay extra for the same. I had called and re-confirmed this more than three times. I had called in even three hours before check-in to ensure this is done. I was assured it would be done before we arrived. We came to the hotel and the front desk staff intimated that they never received any such request. Since it was a surprise it turned out to be quite a spoiler. Though the room was nice. We were given one with twin mattresses. We had to repeatedly request for a change in room with at least a queen mattress.(So much for an anniversary). We were told the hotel was running full.So we would be given a room change the next day.It never happened.Quite disappointing. Even the service in the restaurant was appalling none of the waiters bother to even keep the cutlery on the table after we have taken out plates or serve us even drinking water we had to repeatedly request for it.Being a 5-star hotel we were surprised at the dismal service. I might not consider the property again solely for the lack of service. Also the restaurants lack a choice of vegetarian food. especially the fine dinning restaurants does not serve any vegetarian food. even on request.We we forced to use the buffet every time.Which also has limited options.Disappointed again.

"Our stay was from 01st of April to the 02nd of April. As April was a month where a lot of tourists are attracted to Sri Lanka, the hotel did have a lot of guests. But the staff made sure that everyone was treated in a special way. The mastermind behind the architecture of Heritance Ahungalla is Late Geoffrey Bawa and as a result, it’s one of the most striking resorts in the Sri Lankan coast. From the moment where you set foot in the hotel till you leave, the staff stays by your side making sure that your stay is memorable. We experienced a situation which made our visit unforgettable, on the 02nd of April. It was my daughter’s birthday on the 02nd and on the previous day, Mr. Nipun Mawatta happened to know about it from a friendly talk with us. However that simple conversation was enough for him to alert the rest of the staff to surprise my daughter at breakfast on the 02nd by appearing suddenly with a trolley laden with balloons and a birthday cake with the restaurant crew coming together to sing happy birthday as she cut the cake. It was totally an unexpected, well-planned surprise and Mr. Mawatte and the staff deserves a shower of thanks. Not to forget, the food at Heritance was always “never-enough” due to their taste and variety. The rooms were lavish and we highly recommend the rooms with the ocean view as it is truly amazing. The infinity pool is always inviting in the burning heat. During our stay, several gents in the staff decided to display their hidden talents from a hilarious performance after dinner. It kept everyone laughing every time we recalled it. Heritance Ahungalla is one of the greatest places to experience the beauty of the Sri Lankan coast and a place “WHERE TRADITION IS ALIVE”.",positive,our stay wa from st of april to the nd of april a april wa a month where a lot of tourist are attracted to sri lanka the hotel did have a lot of guest but the staff made sure that everyone wa treated in a special way the mastermind behind the architecture of heritance ahungalla is late geoffrey bawa and a a result it one of the most striking resort in the sri lankan coast from the moment where you set foot in the hotel till you leave the staff stay by your side making sure that your stay is memorable we experienced a situation which made our visit unforgettable on the nd of april it wa my daughter birthday on the nd and on the previous day mr nipun mawatta happened to know about it from a friendly talk with u however that simple conversation wa enough for him to alert the rest of the staff to surprise my daughter at breakfast on the nd by appearing suddenly with a trolley laden with balloon and a birthday cake with the restaurant crew coming together to sing happy birthday a she cut the cake it wa totally an unexpected wellplanned surprise and mr mawatte and the staff deserves a shower of thanks not to forget the food at heritance wa always neverenough due to their taste and variety the room were lavish and we highly recommend the room with the ocean view a it is truly amazing the infinity pool is always inviting in the burning heat during our stay several gent in the staff decided to display their hidden talent from a hilarious performance after dinner it kept everyone laughing every time we recalled it heritance ahungalla is one of the greatest place to experience the beauty of the sri lankan coast and a place where tradition is alive,1731,311,4.569131832797428,3,0.9972,0.2,0.011,0.789,0.2743772893772894,0.6469749694749694

"We arrived here nearly a week ago to torrential rain. This is the end of the monsoon season in this part of the island. First impressions of the hotel were lovely. The staff are what makes this hotel a pleasure to stay in. We were shown to our room which was a little dated but clean and cool. The rain Showers in the room are great and the shower gel smells of a tropical fruit sensation. Food here is amazing. The head chef Manjua runs a great team of chefs who are more than happy to cook you what you like if what's on offer isn't to your taste. They sure know how to make curries here. You must try every single one as they are divine. Our ever expanding waistlines are proof of this. There is plenty more on offer if curries are not your thing. A myriad of fresh fruit is available and bananas taste amazing, nothing like what we eat at home. The weather was good most days. Towards the early evening rain clouds gather and a heavy downpour follows. Perfect time for a G&T at the pool bar. Sunsets are incredible and worth waiting around to see. The beach is vast and deserted. Just a few hotel guests walking along taking in it beauty. There are however beach guys who nag the pants off you to sell you sightseeing trips. Be aware they usually don't have insurance so best to book with a reputable company. They are harmless just a few no thank you and they get the message. There are a group of ladies who sell sarongs and trinkets on the beach they are lovely and friendly, don't forget to barter here, start low and then usually meet in the middle. Be careful of the sun you burn very quickly and don't forget mozzie repellant and bite cream. We used a guide for our trips LASI TOURS LASI was great and drove safely through the traffic which is another world in itself. He is very knowledgable and will arrange bespoke tours according to your needs. Sri Lanka is beautiful. Made even more special by its people. The temples, turtle sanctuaries, elephant retreats are fab. Unfortunately we didn't have enough time to see everything so a revisit will be on the cards.

"We had an amazing time at this hotel, during which we held a wedding ceremony and party with our friends and family. The hotel has 2 big pools and is directly on the beach. The staff were amazing in helping us arrange the wedding and catering to the needs of the party, in total there was 31 in the group. All the staff were amazing but in particular Shanika & Paveen created an event to remember and took away any stress we may have had in organizing everything. We had a ceremony on the beach followed by a BBQ, and the use of the on site nightclub. Everyone had a great day. All the party commented on how good the food was, we even had vegans and vegetarians who were happy with the food on offer.

"This hotel was the first destination of our honeymoon. The cool and calm environment that one encounters as you drive through the gates up to the reception is certainly inviting and to say that reflects the hotel's outlook would be an understatement. The check in was breezy with a warm welcoming service by the front office staff - now that's what I call hospitality. Although the room we got was located in the far corner, the room condition and facilities were simply breathtaking. The snacks provided were somewhat overwhelming but they tasted so well, that one would be stupid to resist. The Jacuzzi was a mind-blowing experience. As for the hotel service, I simply don't know how they do it, but they will be there at your doorstep literally seconds after you keep the phone. The restaurant and its management have won many accolades which they proudly display at the entrance. It was not before long that we realised why they receive them. The food is simply amazing with an endless spread. To walk around and have a look alone can fill you up. The flavours blend so well and they know how to exert the correct balance of tastes especially in local cuisines. The action stations were constantly full of action with a variety from prawns, sausages, bacon and waffles steaming continuously. Despite serious time restrictions and a house full of guests, the staff will go the extra mile just to see that smile on your face. The weekend extravaganza is something that one should not miss. On Fridays and Saturdays, the hotel features a cultural extravaganza with traditional and contemporary performances including the occasional fire limbo. Simply worth the time. The locality of the area features picteresque river boat rides to which the hotel also has some arrangements at additional cost. We could not make this journey, but previous experiences suggest that this cannot fail. The only option for improvement that I could think for the hotel is that it shows no signage for anyone plying from the South towards it. Whilst motorists from Colombo along the Galle Road (A2) would not miss the hotel sign, we travelled along the expressway (E1) to come up from south. Nearly missed the turn but managed not to overshoot it too much thanks to some roadside assistance. All in all, this was the first destination upon entering matrimony, and the warm service and comfortable outing at Heritance Ahungalla will be etched in our memories forever. A surefire revisiting option for us.",positive,this hotel wa the first destination of our honeymoon the cool and calm environment that one encounter a you drive through the gate up to the reception is certainly inviting and to say that reflects the hotel outlook would be an understatement the check in wa breezy with a warm welcoming service by the front office staff now thats what i call hospitality although the room we got wa located in the far corner the room condition and facility were simply breathtaking the snack provided were somewhat overwhelming but they tasted so well that one would be stupid to resist the jacuzzi wa a mindblowing experience a for the hotel service i simply dont know how they do it but they will be there at your doorstep literally second after you keep the phone the restaurant and it management have won many accolade which they proudly display at the entrance it wa not before long that we realised why they receive them the food is simply amazing with an endless spread to walk around and have a look alone can fill you up the flavour blend so well and they know how to exert the correct balance of taste especially in local cuisine the action station were constantly full of action with a variety from prawn sausage bacon and waffle steaming continuously despite serious time restriction and a house full of guest the staff will go the extra mile just to see that smile on your face the weekend extravaganza is something that one should not miss on friday and saturday the hotel feature a cultural extravaganza with traditional and contemporary performance including the occasional fire limbo simply worth the time the locality of the area feature picteresque river boat ride to which the hotel also ha some arrangement at additional cost we could not make this journey but previous experience suggest that this can not fail the only option for improvement that i could think for the hotel is that it show no signage for anyone plying from the south towards it whilst motorist from colombo along the galle road a would not miss the hotel sign we travelled along the expressway e to come up from south nearly missed the turn but managed not to overshoot it too much thanks to some roadside assistance all in all this wa the first destination upon entering matrimony and the warm service and comfortable outing at heritance ahungalla will be etched in our memory forever a surefire revisiting option for u,2483,420,4.914285714285715,2,0.9924,0.137,0.033,0.831,0.18210978835978833,0.5005621693121693

"When we hear the name Heritance of Aitken Spence, we usually consider it to be one of the most exciting stays. But unfortunately it is a shame to the so called brand Heritance and as well as for the Aitken Spence. We went there for our annual gathering of my workplace and we have reserved about 19 rooms for the last weekend. please find the following: Welcome: They have warmly welcomed us and given the rooms on time. It is appreciated since we got the rooms just within half an hour. Rooms: The room given to me and my wife was on the third floor. Right at the moment we stepped in to the room we felt that it was not cleaned properly. Basically it was not swept at all for weeks as we felt. We were not even provided with the bathrobes to the rooms. Further, only two towels were available at the room and not even the face towels were placed. Bathroom amenities were so old and an immediate renovation should be taken place. One of the Tea/Coffee mugs in the room was not washed (Pictures attached). Buffet: Only one restaurant in operation or only one restaurant is available. It was totally crowded. Dinner on 26th Sept 2020: Restaurant was fully crowded. They do not provide at least the enough seating capacity for the guests. If I'm not mistaken, there were two other groups checked-in to the hotel during that day. However they have arranged some tables outside the restaurant where they were not attended by a single restaurant staff member just to refill their water goblets. Food was totally bad and had a very bad experience with the so called Sri Lankan Chicken Kottu Roti. It was totally frozen andwas not tasty at all. I have complained but the only answer I got from the so called F&B Manager or the Guest Services Representative was 'Will inform and will check with the chef'. Is that an answer from a so called hotel chain like Heritance by Aitken Spence??? Restaurant staff were not capable of attending to the guests and could not even clean the buffet frequently. Please find the attached pictures of the Ice Cream corner. Breakfast on 27th Sept 2020: Compared to the dinner on previous night, this was slightly okay. But they failed arrange the seating for the whole set of occupents. Lunch on 27th Sept 2020: Again it was horrible and had nothing to eat at all. We went for lunch around 1.30pm and even on that time they are out of some food. They had a bowl with a name tag 'Chicken Sausages' and only a half of a sausage is left. When I asked for 4 sausages to me & my wife, the guy came and noted our table and promised to bring them to our table. But unfortunately I couldn't see him afterwards. When it comes to desserts corner, there were nithing to eat at all and please refer the pictures attached. No more refilling or serving and the time was 2.35pm. Premises: There was a very bad smell in the whole hotel from the evening to the noon of the next day. When inquired, they said it is from the sea. But please note that this is not the only hotel we visted in the sea side and we have no any kind of an experience from the rest of the hotels we visited. I have never being to a Heritance Hotel before and I hope that the rest of the Heritance hotels would not be like this. Personally, I'm so disappointed with the hotel and I didn't expect this kind of a service and an experience from you guys. Lack of staff, does not mean that you are free from providing the five star hospitality. If you don't have the sufficient staff, please do not accept so much of bookings for a day. In my opinion, you should pay more attention to the above in order to provide a better experience to the people who visit Heritance Ahungalla. Further, especially in this period, you all are surviving just because of the locals. I'm truly disappointed and also feel very sad. By the way, Good Luck!",negative,when we hear the name heritance of aitken spence we usually consider it to be one of the most exciting stay but unfortunately it is a shame to the so called brand heritance and a well a for the aitken spence we went there for our annual gathering of my workplace and we have reserved about room for the last weekend please find the following welcome they have warmly welcomed u and given the room on time it is appreciated since we got the room just within half an hour room the room given to me and my wife wa on the third floor right at the moment we stepped in to the room we felt that it wa not cleaned properly basically it wa not swept at all for week a we felt we were not even provided with the bathrobe to the room further only two towel were available at the room and not even the face towel were placed bathroom amenity were so old and an immediate renovation should be taken place one of the teacoffee mug in the room wa not washed picture attached buffet only one restaurant in operation or only one restaurant is available it wa totally crowded dinner on th sept restaurant wa fully crowded they do not provide at least the enough seating capacity for the guest if im not mistaken there were two other group checkedin to the hotel during that day however they have arranged some table outside the restaurant where they were not attended by a single restaurant staff member just to refill their water goblet food wa totally bad and had a very bad experience with the so called sri lankan chicken kottu roti it wa totally frozen andwas not tasty at all i have complained but the only answer i got from the so called fb manager or the guest service representative wa will inform and will check with the chef is that an answer from a so called hotel chain like heritance by aitken spence restaurant staff were not capable of attending to the guest and could not even clean the buffet frequently please find the attached picture of the ice cream corner breakfast on th sept compared to the dinner on previous night this wa slightly okay but they failed arrange the seating for the whole set of occupents lunch on th sept again it wa horrible and had nothing to eat at all we went for lunch around pm and even on that time they are out of some food they had a bowl with a name tag chicken sausage and only a half of a sausage is left when i asked for sausage to me my wife the guy came and noted our table and promised to bring them to our table but unfortunately i couldnt see him afterwards when it come to dessert corner there were nithing to eat at all and please refer the picture attached no more refilling or serving and the time wa pm premise there wa a very bad smell in the whole hotel from the evening to the noon of the next day when inquired they said it is from the sea but please note that this is not the only hotel we visted in the sea side and we have no any kind of an experience from the rest of the hotel we visited i have never being to a heritance hotel before and i hope that the rest of the heritance hotel would not be like this personally im so disappointed with the hotel and i didnt expect this kind of a service and an experience from you guy lack of staff doe not mean that you are free from providing the five star hospitality if you dont have the sufficient staff please do not accept so much of booking for a day in my opinion you should pay more attention to the above in order to provide a better experience to the people who visit heritance ahungalla further especially in this period you all are surviving just because of the local im truly disappointed and also feel very sad by the way good luck,3812,706,4.40084985835694,-1,-0.7586,0.089,0.092,0.818,-0.023168712797619034,0.5496744791666667

"We just got back from Ahungalla one of 3 hotels we stayed at in Sri Lanka, we spent the first few days of our holiday travelling around and then 4 nights here. Quite frankly I cannot believe the rubbish some nit pickers write on here. The hotel is amazing, the setting is gorgeous and the staff are the friendliest we met. All the staff are very well trained and could not help us enough very approachable. The room was clean and kept clean daily by housekeeping who did an outstanding job. The A/C worked wonders and our room was a constant cool haven from the outside temperatures. We were on a half board basis and ate every day at the resturant. I found the variety good and my husband enjoyed all the local dishes, even on a day when i couldnt find a meal to my taste the kitchen prepared me something just for me.

"I used to be a frequent guest since early 2009. This hotel used to be one of the best in every possible way. I should say that the location is great, with absolutely stunning views of the southern beaches of Sri Lanka. The architecture, flora and fauna gives a very relaxing feeling away from the commercial/business feeling. The staff is still very helpful, most would bed over back to entertain the guests. During the last visit with my wife they even upgraded me to their best suite, the Sachin Tendulkar Suite with no buzz or hazel at all. I must say, the rooms are of good size. But unfortunately that is where it ends! The buffets are not up to the standards ( I am being very polite and generous towards the hotel here). Variety is lacking, taste is lacking, freshness is lacking. The edible items run over in 1 hour, so if you go there it late - you are left to trial the buns and sandwiches like parchment, and some left over stuff. As with many other hotels in SL they seem to cater a specific corporate client base, as a result the food spoils it for the relaxing holiday traveller. This is not just one time experience, but my observations over time. Restaurants and ala carte has little to offer. The ""best suite"" feels like collapsing on one end, not cleaned for days on another note, and worse of all even the renovation seems to be left at half way. Little activities happening at night, and the management does not seem to be interested in addressing it for years. Last few visits all I felt is that the staff at junior positions, room services, and reception are trying to blow some warmth and energy into it, but the higher levels seem to be not bothered about what they offer to the clients. While I do believe, looking at the number of corporate customers in the restaurant (mainly East Asian and Indian - whom I have randomly come to contact with, have informed me that they are sent to this place via corporate arrangements, not by choice) that the hotel is likely making good returns and is not financially pressured to invest in restructuring and renovation; it makes me sad that this is like an aincient giant which is approaching its last legs. Would I recommend it to anyone? Probably not if you are on your vacation. Given there are quite nice new boutique hotels in the area, for a fraction higher price point. Would I go there again? Probably not, unless the hotel addresses these issues effectively, because it's a waste of time and money the way it is.",negative,i used to be a frequent guest since early this hotel used to be one of the best in every possible way i should say that the location is great with absolutely stunning view of the southern beach of sri lanka the architecture flora and fauna give a very relaxing feeling away from the commercialbusiness feeling the staff is still very helpful most would bed over back to entertain the guest during the last visit with my wife they even upgraded me to their best suite the sachin tendulkar suite with no buzz or hazel at all i must say the room are of good size but unfortunately that is where it end the buffet are not up to the standard i am being very polite and generous towards the hotel here variety is lacking taste is lacking freshness is lacking the edible item run over in hour so if you go there it late you are left to trial the bun and sandwich like parchment and some left over stuff a with many other hotel in sl they seem to cater a specific corporate client base a a result the food spoil it for the relaxing holiday traveller this is not just one time experience but my observation over time restaurant and ala carte ha little to offer the best suite feel like collapsing on one end not cleaned for day on another note and worse of all even the renovation seems to be left at half way little activity happening at night and the management doe not seem to be interested in addressing it for year last few visit all i felt is that the staff at junior position roomservices and reception are trying to blow some warmth and energy into it but the higher level seem to be not bothered about what they offer to the client while i do believe looking at the number of corporate customer in the restaurant mainly east asian and indian whom i have randomly come to contact with have informed me that they are sent to this place via corporate arrangement not by choice that the hotel is likely making good return and is not financially pressured to invest in restructuring and renovation it make me sad that this is like an aincient giant which is approaching it last leg would i recommend it to anyone probably not if you are on your vacation given there are quite nice new boutique hotel in the area for a fraction higher price point would i go there again probably not unless the hotel address these issue effectively because it a waste of time and money the way it is,2485,452,4.5,6,0.9953,0.155,0.038,0.808,0.1090463458110517,0.3942067736185383

"Apologies ! This should have been written a while ago. By no means does the below completely under rate our experience, but hopefully the feedback will be taken as useful, with both the good and bad. The Bad: Having to change rooms the last 2 days, due to water heating and aircon issues. Lack of food options when less guests (totally understandable but still a shame, especially at breakfeast). Wear and tear is visible, a renovation would be a great bonus. But it by no means spoilt our trip, just an observation. Alot of mould in the bathrooms, requires some attention. I know it's a beach resort but the build up can get a little much. Due to choosing ""all inclusive"" option, the cocktails are very limited. Are nice but limited. I think if I went next time I would not do all inclusive, purely so we could enjoy a bit more diverse range. Snack foods however, (I recomend the fish and chips!) are lovely ! Due to post covid, lack of features and actitives are limited (again understandable, but needs mentioning prior to booking). Examples, Bicycle rentals, Spas, nightclub etc. Also the build up on rubbish on the shores, but again was due to time of the year with the seas as well. The Weird: The constant hello from a lady passing the perimeter of the hotel nearly every day trying to sell something. A Foreign guest who seems to be treated like royalty & known by all staff (Hi Aiya?!), I know there are less guests, but 3 beds, 6 cushions and 6 towels (with change every few hrs) for 2 people is a bit much... Also witnessed the attempt of trying to give chocolates to everyone including children (other guests) seemed a bit weird, maybe their form of a Santa? The repetiveness of the music in the restaurant and the bar, please I would advise working on changing this ! Or atleast having a different playlist alternating every other day ! If I heard John Lenon's Yesterday instrumental one more time... !! And the rest of Good ! (a lot more) : Firstly, the highest points go to the the staff and service, truely everyone that worked there were such amazing human beings, and we were humbled to have stayed at the resort with them ! Their commitment and attentivness was visible throughout our stay, so thank you very much to all of you. Cleaners : Nearly every day not only were the rooms tidied, but we were left with decorative and hilarious towel arrangements ! Kudos to the creativity ! Shout out to Dukmal and his colleagues for this ! I wish you all the best sir. Front of house & general assitance : Welcomed from the first minute by all and every request and detail asked was attented to. Samith whom we were greeted every day by and was checked in on was a great help & very friendly, even arranged a tour to the Safari for us and breakfasts to take was ensured. Sorry we missed saying good bye to you ! Hope to see you again. Restaurant: Lilanga, a gentlemen in charge of the restaurant, with a wealth of knowledge and tries to cater to all your needs . If you ever feel a meal is not right or if you need something, do reach out to him and he will help you, Thanks again ! A big gratitude to Jananjaya, whom we felt looked after us so much every day. Whom we grew to bond with, it was a pleasure meeting you ! Other names to mention, and sorry for not remembering all ! Tony, Panditha, Chamila as well, and also the lovely ladies who always greeted us and sat us down to our tables for every service. Bar: Much thanks to Calinga ! Thank you for all the cocktails. And again others who served us at the bar ! Pool: Both guys we had were amazing and made sure we always had towels, and cushion for the sunbeds. Dinesh, very nice to meet you and always laughing and joking made us so much more at ease. And last but not least, although I dont have names to mention. Many thanks to the security guards who would tend to go unnoticed, but honestly they made us feel safe and secure always seeing them around. The location, on the beach front, shame about the rough seas, cannot wait to see what it is like when the seas are calm ! With the infinity pool in the main area, it felt like you were in the sea anyway ! The food selection, although sometimes smaller, sometimes bigger. Always had a good variety for most days, and was always very tasty, and fresh. As one can expect, spices are prevalent but again requests can be made to amend this. There is alot of western options to accomodate. Again a shout out to Tony whom after talking about the fact that we never saw any Kottu on the buffet, was then on the main Buffet stand the next day being enjoyed not only by our selves but all other guests ! Buffer / BBQs on the outside garden is alway also a great addition when they can accomodate this ! The peacefulness. I think due to the post covid situation, we had the best of both worlds in a sense. Weekdays we pretty much had the pools to ourselves, and the weekends more locals arrived and so the resort was busier. As much as the peacefulness was appreciated, hopefully in the future, more ""animations /activies"" & I would look to see all bars in full operation, can be achieved to change the days up a bit. The wildlife, Birds, Iguanas, lizards, monkeys. Nothing disturbing but made it so much more tranquil with the plantation as well being among all of this. Not to mention the few dogs and cats. If you like plantation indoors as well, then you will enjoy the rooms and hotel itself as well, at night time they look even better if the lights are working. We stayed at Heritance 15th to the 27th. And really hope to visit another time in the near future !",neutral,apology this should have been written a while ago by no mean doe the below completely under rate our experience but hopefully the

"We decided to stay at Heritance Ahungalla during our recent trip to Sri Lanka for two reasons... 1. The taj At bentota was under renovation and 2. People generally had good things to say about it. However our experience was OK. Rooms- they are clean, decent size, comfortable beds...but they were somehow a little dull.. Otherwise the rooms were quite clean and the housekeeping generally was good. We had a beautiful view of the sea from the room Food was expensive in the fine dining restaurants.. Buffet and coffee shop were ok though. We didn't quite like the dinner buffet, the breakfast buffet was decent. Overall hotel is ok. When you enter the lobby you don't feel that this is a luxury property. Though it's clean it's really minimalistic. They say it's the geoffery bawa minimalistic design and I personally prefer less to more but This place was actually quite bare. The pool however is very picturesque,,,and very clean. The main disappointment however was the beach. The beach actually was ok .. clean and all but the ocean floor was not a gentle sloping floor like in bentota near taj. It's some thing like it will be 3 feet deep ten feet from the beach and then 1 foot deep when you go further. S it was quite scary for a non swimmer like me as I was not prepared for the sudden drop in the ocean floor. The service overall was good and very courteous. However, the fact that the housekeeping staff barges into your room once u call for a check out was something I Didn't appreciate and thought it was very rude. They knock once and use their key to enter to check the minibar. They don't hv the decency to wait till we open the door or ask them to come in. The other staff was very good. There were a lot of children at the resort and the staff was very patient with all the kids who were almost wrecking their Christmas trees and running around the buffet place like crazy",neutral,we decided to stay at heritance ahungalla during our recent trip to sri lanka for two reason the taj at bentota wa under renovation and people generally had good thing to say about it however our experience wa ok room they are clean decent size comfortable bedsbut they were somehow a little dull otherwise the room were quite clean and the housekeeping generally wa good we had a beautiful view of the sea from the room food wa expensive in the fine dining restaurant buffet and coffee shop were ok though we didnt quite like the dinner buffet the breakfast buffet wa decent overall hotel is ok when you enter the lobby you dont feel that this is a luxury property though it clean it really minimalistic they say it the geoffery bawa minimalistic design and i personally prefer less to more but this place wa actually quite bare the pool however is very picturesqueand very clean the main disappointment however wa the beach the beach actually wa ok clean and all but the ocean floor wa not a gentle sloping floor like in bentota near taj it some thing like it will be foot deep ten foot from the beach and then foot deep when you go further s it wa quite scary for a non swimmer like me a i wa not prepared for the sudden drop in the ocean floor the service overall wa good and very courteous however the fact that the housekeeping staff barge into your room once u call for a check out wa something i didnt appreciate and thought it wa very rude they knock once and use their key to enter to check the minibar they dont hv the decency to wait till we open the door or ask them to come in the other staff wa very good there were a lot of child at the resort and the staff wa very patient with all the kid who were almost wrecking their christmas tree and running around the buffet place like crazy,1889,346,4.46242774566474,3,0.9651,0.137,0.077,0.787,0.15272875816993464,0.5123202614379084

"Our problem started upon our arrival when we were told that we had been upgraded to a luxury room, but it turned out to be an isolated one (at the very end of the hotel) with a view on tennis courts. In addition, the room contained only 2 beds (One queen-sized and another “Extra” bed). As we had explicitly requested (and confirmed twice with our travel agent) a room with 3 beds and a sea view, we made this clear to the staff member who showed us the room. After she spent some time on the phone, she referred us to the manager on duty( Srinath A ). This manager was beyond rude and impatient, immediately telling us that there were no other rooms available for us to change, because apparently we had checked in late (6 pm). Brushing aside this unprofessionalism, we peacefully requested a refund, in order to be available to switch hotels and find what we are looking for elsewhere. At this point, the manager refused and defiantly told us: “We don’t have money at the hotel. Talk to your travel agent to get money, and go''. After spending 3 hours in the lobby and threatening to escalate if we were not refunded our money right away, suddenly and magically, a suite became available for us to move into, which uncovered the lies that were being told before about the hotel being fully-booked.

"We stayed at this hotel for the first time back in the late 90s, when it was called Triton. By the way, the statue of this Triton still flaunts at the entrance. It was a marvelous, respectable hotel with several restaurants, a tea room, fine service, and two lovely swimming pools. This is a beautiful colonial-style building, inside there are very beautiful galleries, between which water flows, trees and flowers grow. This is real architecture, not a soulless block with rooms. Unfortunately, the hotel ended up under water in December, 2004. The staff will tell you that only the first floor was flooded, and they will lie. Typical tsunami traces will also be on the third floor, this can be seen, although the walls are being tinted. I don't really understand how they got 5 stars. It is a very sad sight of destruction and extinction. The hotel is a pity as an old horse, from which they are trying to squeeze out the remnants of strength. Unmown grass, peeling sun loungers, frayed beach towels, yellowed bath towels, stained old linen, squeaky air conditioner, mildew, dampness, musty. Tiles are falling off in pools. Fence-mesh around the perimeter. And that is not all. This once beautiful hotel is now used as a staging post for bus groups, arriving to spend one night before departure. From the pros: It is still an outwardly beautiful building The staff works with full dedication Decent cuisine for Europeans, not too spicy, many adapted dishes.

"Our first stay here in 2009 was on the very strong recommendation of Sri Lankan friends and we vowed to return sooner rather than later. Neither my wife or I recognised some of the negative comments on this site prior to booking our latest trip in December 2011 but we had some concerns. Those concerns were totally unfounded. From the moment we were met with refreshing cinnamon tea until the redoubtable Dudley packed our cases in the car at the end of our stay, it was total relaxation. The attitude of the staff is a delight and may explain some of the complaints - they have a wonderful ability of being remarkably attentive whilst appearing to be laid back which may be misinterpreted as appearing not to care.Nothing could be further from the truth. Some of the younger staff members are still extremely keen and their enthusiasm, whilst appreciated, intrudes slightly into the relaxed ambiance. They could do well to learn from Jacob. If you have the good fortune to have your table served by this gentleman you will understand the point I'm attempting to make. He is like a swan gliding serenely on the surface whilst away from view he is paddling like hell to ensure that you enjoy every minute in his care. Our room was excellent - the only criticism we could make was the that the Venetian blind in the bathroom was past its best.... this is really struggling to be negative. I can't believe that someone on here had complained about the food - how absurd! Not only was the buffet absolutely first class but the puddings were out of this world. A real trip down memory lane for persons of a certain age! Unsurprisingly, the dessert table won first prize in the hotel industry awards. Please don't take my word for this - our visit coincided with that of an annual trip of French gamblers(???!) to the hotel. They attacked each meal with that Gallic gusto which is unique, (complete with napkins tied around their necks!) - if it hadn't been up to standard I'm sure that it would have been the kitchen staff at risk rather than the food! When these lovely characters found that my wife was multi-lingual they hijacked her on a regular basis to tell the hotel chefs of their appreciation. Another negative comment I had read was regarding the beach folk. Yes, at times they can be boorish but they are trying to make a living. If you inform them that you are definitely not interested in purchasing anything today they will leave you alone. You are, however, missing the opportunity to chat to some fascinating people with experiences completely different to your own who would really appreciate the opportunity of honing their language skills on you - this is especially true of the clothing ladies. If all else fails the magic word to use is 'yanda!' whose interpretation is, I believe as rude as it is effective!

"Originally designed by Geoffery Bawa this is a hotel with impact. Beautiful pool areas and superb setting. The staff are always polite and friendly - always ready with a smile and going out of their way to assist. When booking a room be sure to state if you want a double rather than a twin. This hotel codes 'double' as twin beds positioned next to each other. So for a shared bed you need to request a 'king size' upon booking. A small irritating change of descriptor that lead to many a confusion and many a room change request I'm sure. The rooms are of a good size with brilliant en suites - great power showers. We had a large balcony - more of a terrace which was perfect for a g&t as the sun went down. We were on an all-inclusive package eating from the main restaurant each meal whilst in the hotel. Whilst I am never a fan of buffet style dining the quality and range of good was astounding. Always a fab selection of salads and local fruits as well as everything in between. We sampled do many new local dishes - one chef even cooking a new dish to try especially for me! If however it's Mediterranean/English fare you fancy whilst in the tropics, well then too you will not be disappointed. There were always about eight non-local dishes and about the same of Sri Lankan. Plus - if you're still peckish - a dizzying array of desserts. We arrived out of school holiday season and both pools were perfect for working off all that food, or pootling about in. On the last days of our stay however considerably more families arrived which made the pools, whilst beautiful, a little impractical for a full hotel.

The hotel staff are very hungry for tips (one waiter told me within a minute of meeting that he was the sole breadwinner for his family and he only earned 4,000 rupees a month). It gets oppressive. The cleaners come into your room (both sets, am and pm) and tell you they are the only person responsible for cleaning your room (and can I have a tip please! ). We were given only one mug, and there were a lot of mosquitos in the room. The toiletries are in refillable china containers and its impossible to get anything out of them. Food is very good but lunches and drinks very expensive. Gave us a lovely christmas eve meal and went to great efforts (ice sculptures and father christmas arriving in a boat.)

"We stayed for Christmas 2007 and agree with other reviewers that the hotel has been beautifully refurbished. We had a fantastic room with a sea view, very comfy bed, huge bathroom, all spotlessly clean. The pool area is stunning and the pool attendants very helpful in brining loungers, towels and refreshing slices of watermelon. A few rupees on day one will get you a great spot and a parasol for the rest of your stay! However we were disappointed with both the food and the service. Yes the fine dinning is superb but overall the food was too ""international"" with very limited choice for those of us that travel in Asia for the delicious local food. As there is absolutely nothing outside of the hotel ,and only very limited choices if you take long a taxi ride to other towns along the coast, we soon became bored with the choice of one Sri lanka curry, one chinese style stir fry and the local dish of Devilled chicken. Personally we don't travel for 11 hours to eat a rack of lamb no matter how good it is! The hotel was busy at it was Chistmas and it took ages to get served, particularly at the pool bar. Over one hour for a sandwich and a beer for lunch on one occaision. Overal the hotel is excellent provided you like an ""all inclusive"" type of holiday. Having travelled extensivley in India, Thailand, and Malaysia we were a little disappointed in Sri Lanka overall. It takes forever to get anywhere as the roads are so bad and so congested, the food wasn't that great anywhere, Columbo is polluted and rather grim. Whilst the beaches in the South are fantastic we enjoyed our stay further North more. Tragically there is still a long way to go to recover from the Tsunami. The lack of tourists is having the effect that those that do go are seen as ""cash cows"" we felt somewhat ripped off on more than one occaision.

"After a week of touring around Sri Lanka for the first part of our honeymoon we were looking forward to spending a week by the sea in a 5 star resort. Unfotunately we were very disappointed with this hotel. The good points about the hotel are the large swimming pools and the view of the sea from most parts of the hotel. The bad points are numerous: -During our stay the weather was very windy and it rained heavily. The hotel is not designed to cope heavy rainfall as it is designed in a very modern, open minimalist way. All the corridors, a bar and the cafe are completely open to the elements. This meant that rain was constantly pouring in and the floors were several centimetres deep in some places. This made the floors very slippy and we found we were unable to get around the hotel much and it made sitting in the front bar and cafe impossible as the bar does not have any front covers to keep the rain out. The staff are constantly sweeping the water away and moving furniture around out of the rain which was very irritating. The overall cleanliness of the hotel is not that great either and the hotel is starting to look rundown. The bathroom in our room had lots of mould in the shower(picture attached), and there was no bath option, you have to pay for a premium top floor room to get a bath! Having stayed in many 5 star and 4 star hotels all over Europe and Asia, I would say this is a 3 star at best, the other 3 star hotels we stayed in during our holiday were in fact much better. -The food is boring and pricey by Sri Lankan standards although you would expect that in a 5 star hotel. We went to the fine dining restaurant one night which was pretty good, although very run-of-the-mill options such as steak and mash. The desserts were interesting but after waiting over half an hour, when they arrived they were poorly executed and my dessert was not even what I ordered. Being the only other couple in the restaurant this was certainly not what we expected. The breakfast is also disappointing, the only positive being the traditional Sri Lankan curries offered. The omelette queue was impressive every morning and that only left under-cooked waffles, anaemic chicken sausages and fatty bacon cooked to order. The rest of the buffet was luke-warm at best. The fresh fruit offered however was fesh and ripe and there was lots of choice. -The beach is not for swimming or being on for any length of time. There are local people constantly waiting on the edge of the hotel and the beach trying to sell you things aggressively and stray dogs wandering about do not make you feel safe. The security guards do nothing about the sellers and leave them to shout at you whilst you are lying on sunbeds within the hotel grounds. -Another point to make is that there is nothing to do in the local area- we went to the 'turtle hatchery' before going to the hotel and it took us 10min to look at the 2 ponds in which 2 poor adult turtles are kept, and a small area of sand where the eggs are buried before they hatch. We ended up leaving early as we were fed up with the food, not being able to go on to the beach and the inefficient staff.

"Our stay here cost about £180 per night for a double room. Overall the hotel is nice but just not really living up to the standards you'd expect of a 4 star hotel or the price tag. For example the toilets in the reception area were rather dark and needed a clean and tidy, there were lots of staff around but so many of them doing nothing and at one time I had to ask 5 different staff to order drinks over a period of about 20 mins before anything actually happened, a lot of the time the waiting staff seemed to just cluster in groups and were lost if actually asked to do anything. The cushions on the sun loungers were ancient, one of the things we noticed that should be easy to put right if the hotel put some of its profits back into the premises. The hotel makes a lot of its 'award winning' chefs which became a bit irritating after a couple of days as some food was great, some really not so good and I had the only stomach upset of the entire trip after eating at the hotel as did a couple of the family, I think due to food being reheated as some things looked rather familiar. Also they seemed thrown at breakfast if more than one or two people wanted the freshly cooked items such as hoppers so you had to wait absolutely ages or give up and have items that were not needing cooking - a real shame as I love my Dosa and hoppers! The kids club was good but the evening entertainment seemed to be the male ents team dressing in drag every night and miming to something and they seemed to abandon the kids pretty quickly if there was any sign of mingling with the grown ups. The other big downer for the hotel is the mosquitoes which are absolutely rife, not totally avoidable but I feel they could have made more of an effort with the rooms and common areas to minimise the mozzy numbers - as most of the other hotels we stayed in had done. Plus points were the two nice pools and the nice view of the sea.

Nothing was said on check in...no special greeting...nothing. We were taken to our room, I told the lady taking us there that I had e-mailed and wanted to make sure we got a sea view. She was quite dismissive. When we got to our room, it was ground floor level taking us straight out to the pool. You could hear the sea, but defiantly couldn’t see it. The room was pleasant enough-modern with a big bed but definatly not 5 star. There was a congratulations cake on the table to great us (we had one at most places we stayed to be honest). But that was the only thing we got to feel special. No one asked whether we would like to organise a special dinner etc etc. As the cake was so big, it was going to take us several days to eat it. Housekeeping could have taken it away and put it in the fridge, but instead it was left out on the side to attract ants. We were just overall a bit disappointed...it was defiantly more of a family hotel and there were kids everywhere the whole weekend we were there and breakfast was crazy-we thought that the hotel was opening up the restaurant and pool to non residents at the weekend. The restaurant needs a facelift for sure as it again did not feel like 5* dining. At breakfast we always waited patiently to be seated, once seated the waitress or waiter would hurry off without asking whether we would like tea or coffee. I then had to try and grab someone’s attention again so it basically took 15 minutes to get a hot drink. A little poor for 5*. We had lunch via room service a couple of days and that was pleasant enough-very little choice but if you like chips and sandwiches then it’s fine. They had no samosas and very few of the wines on the extensive wine list on show. I had to chose 3 different wines before finally getting the 4th one I asked for. Also if you like cocktails, you will be disappointed as the ones I had at the hotel were not very nice. We only ate dinner in the restaurant once during our 5 night stop, as we decided we would get better service and food elsewhere. The fine dining restaurant had no people in on any of the nights we were there and we just couldn’t think of anything worse than the madness of that buffet restaurant again. Where the staff were in attentive and miserable. Sorry Heritance but we just expected more I’m sorry. And to top it all off we got a phone call the morning of check-out just to make sure we were checking out on time or if we had booked a late check out. And a bill pushed through the door the night before. Come on...it was low season, hotel was not busy at all and we were on our honeymoon. Every morning we were woken at 5am by noisy people checking out of their rooms or walking in high heels right above our bedroom. With being on the ground floor, we were right on the main drag for people moving around.

"Just got back from the Heritance and had a marvellous time there.It is beautifully designed,with two infinity pools leading your eye out to the sea.Our room had a great sea view and was very well furnished.Beds were comfy and the bathroom was great-I want a wet room like theirs!!!Premiership matches on the box and two english speaking movie channels. The food was very good and i found myself eating curry three times a day!!i also brought a hopper pan back with me to have egg-hoppers for beakfast.However we were a little disappointed with the fine dining restaurant.The prices are the same as back home, and they had very pretty food on the plate, but it needs Gordon Ramsey to go in and make it less fussy and more tasty.With such good seafood(the tuna is the best!) i would have liked to have seen a japanese restaurant or something similar.The 'mustard' coffe shop was more to our liking-less pretentious and good food,and of course you can always find something nice in the buffet restaurant. Service is very good,if a little too much! Sri Lanka is a paradise for wildlife and the hotel has in it's grounds; egrets,bee-eaters,squirrels,a small monitor lizard,gecko's and on an evening a large bat which we named 'Nora' (Batty!) which swooped around the pool bar while we were sipping pre dinner Martini's! We went on a river cruise through the mangroves which was excellent and a trip to Sinharaja Rainforest ,which is a must for bird watchers.Our driver Erish was the best.He took us around the village he grew up in and to meet some of his family,and releasing baby turtles into the sea at Kosgoda was very satisfying. Don't let tales of war in the north put you off going,you are not affected in the least.Soldiers with guns are at a lot of check points near Colombo,but there are thousands of Tamils and Sinhalese living in perfect harmony,it is lot more safe than Northern Ireland ever was.Just keep away from the north and north east to be on the safe side. They have recovered physically very well from the Tsunami,but anyone you talk to has lost loved ones(60,000 people)There won't be another one for hundreds of years,so don't let that put you off either! The Hotel is excellent and Sri Lanka is a lush,wildlife filled paradise,with sun and picture postcard beaches.It reminded me of a cross between Thailand(with Buddhist temples all over) and the nicer parts of south goa,give it a try.We'll definitely go back.",neutral,just got back from the heritance and had a marvellous time thereit is beautifully designedwith two infinity pool leading your eye out to the seaour room had a great sea view and wa very well furnishedbeds were comfy and the bathroom wa greati want a wet room like theirspremiership match on the box and two english speaking movie channel the food wa very good and i found myself eating curry three time a dayi also brought a hopper pan back with me to have egghoppers for beakfasthowever we were a little disappointed with the fine dining restaurantthe price are the same a back home and they had very pretty food on the plate but it need gordon ramsey to go in and make it less fussy and more tastywith such good seafoodthe tuna is the best i would have liked to have seen a japanese restaurant or something similarthe mustard coffe shop wa more to our likingless pretentious and good foodand of course you can always find something nice in the buffet restaurant service is very goodif a little too much sri lanka is a paradise for wildlife and the hotel ha in it ground egretsbeeeaterssquirrelsa small monitor lizardgeckos and on an evening a large bat which we named nora batty which swooped around the pool bar while we were sipping pre dinner martini we went on a river cruise through the mangrove which wa excellent and a trip to sinharaja rainforest which is a must for bird watchersour driver erish wa the besthe took u around the village he grew up in and to meet some of his familyand releasing baby turtle into the sea at kosgoda wa very satisfying dont let tale of war in the north put you off goingyou are not affected in the leastsoldiers with gun are at a lot of check point near colombobut there are thousand of tamil and sinhalese living in perfect harmonyit is lot more safe than northern ireland ever wasjust keep away from the north and north east to be on the safe side they have recovered physically very well from the tsunamibut anyone you talk to ha lost loved one peoplethere wont be another one for hundred of yearsso dont let that put you off either the hotel is excellent and sri lanka is a lushwildlife filled paradisewith sun and picture postcard beachesit reminded me of a cross between thailandwith buddhist temple all over and the nicer part of south goagive it a trywell definitely go back,2432,418,4.820574162679426,5,0.9977,0.181,0.021,0.798,0.31790282392026575,0.4976799557032115

"Booked over the phone for 3 nights which was ok enough. Nice enough hotel with a decent location though the beach was not as nice as you'd get in the east coast or even some Other parts of west coast of Sri Lanka. Most of our time was spent in the 2 pools as were the others from what it seemed as the sea was too rough during our stay. Food was ok, mainly buffet type of food with a decent variety though the fruit selection seems to be the same everyday (melon, papaya, pineapple & guava) Rooms and the hotel was a little dated to be honest and not worthy of 5 or even 4 star, especially compared to some of the other hotels we've stayed during this trip to SL. I do admit though that I have high expectations usually and wouldn't mind paying for it but this hotel was rather less expensive compared to the others and kind of explains why you get dated room & decor (get what you pay for right??) One things I should mention however was the price of food and drinks. It is an absolute rip off when looking at the cost of drinks. All the menu prices are expensive enough , but they add a mandatory service charge of 10% and government VAT 12.5% on top of the final bill which make you pay about 800 LKR (about £4) for a bottle of Corona. Note that local beverages are not cheaper either. A small bottle of water is about 225 LKR which is little too expensive compared to other Sri Lankan luxury hotels. The location itself is not close to Galle so not much to do outside of the hotel. We did do a boat trip on Madu river (about 10 miles out) which was as well worth it but I'd suggest you don't book through the hotel and go directly to the Balapitiya bride where you can see many tour operators and get a boat for a ride. Takes about 90 mins and cost us 2000 LKR (£10) which was well worth it. There also is a turtle hatchery that you can visit which is nice. I probably wouldn't come back to this hotel to be honest as I wasn't overly impressed but could be a decent location for the average, budget conscious traveller looking for a bargain, as long as the price remain cheap.",neutral,booked over the phone for night which wa ok enough nice enough hotel with a decent location though the beach wa not a nice a youd get in the east coast or even some other part of west coast of sri lanka most of our time wa spent in the pool a were the others from what it seemed a the sea wa too rough during our stay food wa ok mainly buffet type of food with a decent variety though the fruit selection seems to be the same everyday melon papaya pineapple guava room and the hotel wa a little dated to be honest and not worthy of or even star especially compared to some of the other hotel weve stayed during this trip to sl i do admit though that i have high expectation usually and wouldnt mind paying for it but this hotel wa rather less expensive compared to the others and kind of explains why you get dated room decor get what you pay for right one thing i should mention however wa the price of food and drink it is an absolute rip off when looking at the cost of drink all the menu price are expensive enough but they add a mandatory service charge of and government vat on top of the final bill which make you pay about lkr about for a bottle of corona note that local beverage are not cheaper either a small bottle of water is about lkr which is little too expensive compared to other sri lankan luxury hotel the location itself is not close to galle so not much to do outside of the hotel we did do a boat trip on madu river about mile out which wa a well worth it but id suggest you dont book through the hotel and go directly to the balapitiya bride where you can see many tour operator and get a boat for a ride take about min and cost u lkr which wa well worth it there also is a turtle hatchery that you can visit which is nice i probably wouldnt come back to this hotel to be honest a i wasnt overly impressed but could be a decent location for the average budget conscious traveller looking for a bargain a long a the price remain cheap,2080,405,4.1382716049382715,0,0.9559,0.071,0.023,0.905,0.11858095238095238,0.5365142857142856

"My fiancé and I returned to this hotel following a stay in 2011. We enjoyed our time spent here and combined a visit to Ella and a stay in a guest house in Kosgoda. We would agree with other reviews that the hotel is in need of updating, however we heard that they are closing the hotel next year for improvements. Having said that, the rooms are fine and all areas are very clean (just quite tired). The service and hospitality is very good and friendly, the bar staff, pool/sunbed staff and especially the lovely man we had cleaning the room (Asoka), we saw him every day and he always went over and above, asking if there was anything he can do or anyway he could improve our room. We actually asked to change rooms as we weren't happy with the view from our first balcony (it overlooked the pool and we wanted something a little more private) and within 30 minutes a new room that suited us was ready. The pool area and garden are beautifully maintained and we loved our time spent around the pool overlooking beautiful Ahungalla beach. We stayed on a B&B basis as we enjoy eating outside of the hotel and there are lovely places to do this; the two beach restaurants just a 5 minute walk from the hotel (jungle restaurant and sunshine restaurant), a beautiful restaurant in the next town along (sankarest garden restaurant, a 5 minute tuk tuk ride at 250 rps). There are also other restaurants in Bentota but this is slightly further afield, 20 minute tuk tuk journey at c. 700 rps (depending on how you haggle). We went to tutle hatchery whilst there and a boat trip, both very worthwhile doing. As previously said, the beach is beautiful and very quiet however, I would be interested to see how it changes once the 500 room (vs. heritance 140) hotel next door is completed in two years time. As other reviews have said, you do get a bit of hassle from the beach sellers however this didn't bother us to much and seemed to die down after a couple of days of saying 'no'. We did book a boat trip through a nice guy called Charli who we'd met and had trips with in 2011, you can find him on the beach and ask any of the sellers for him as they all know each other. We would have liked to have taken the opportunity to hire bikes from the hotel but the weather was just to hot during our stay for either of us to have wanted to do this!

"Excellent location and beach. Hotel is a fantastic design. Great food and the majority of the staff are really friendly. Unfortunately however, although the management have repeated on a number of occasions that the renovations have been completed, they are far from complete. We did have a look at some of the rooms that had been renovated and they looked excellent. Unfortunately, we weren't in one of these, our room was extremely dated, the cleaning was not done to a very high standard and we don't think the balcony had ever been cleaned! We used the pool furthest from reception which was excellent, with well-kept lawns. The major problem here is that there are only 8 umbrellas, unless you want to sit under the trees, we we didn't. I always sit under an umbrella and my wife always sits in the the sun but the problem is that the pool boy reserves the beds/umbrella's for those that have tipped him previously which then involved us having to have an argument with him most mornings to get a place with an umbrella - on some days there were 2 or 3 umbrella's/sun chairs that he had reserved but there weren't used all day as the guests must have gone out for the day, but he wouldn't let anyone sit on them!

"We read all of the guide books and surfed the net before plumping for this hotel having spent the first night at the tired and desperately in need of a refurb Bentota beach resort , great pool sweaty sheets.... only 45 minutes from Galle, which is only worth a day trip any way if you ask me.... If you are looking for a beach side paradise with a modern room with quiet aircon and sliding doors onto a pool that is pure bliss for midnight swims then this cant be faulted. Food is great, plenty of options and places to eat, your room, the terrace, cafe or fine dining. Tennis, Snooker and yoga, not in that order.... We stayed in 5 hotels from Kandy, Nuwara, Dambulla and here. this was the best value and the most excellent. service was fab.

"We were unfortunate to stay at this hotel on a day that they celebrated the Earth Day in 2023. We love, encourage, and actively participate in similar programs. The problem was, how the hotel management went about the celebration and their lack of planning. Hotel management decided to shut all electrical lights in the downstairs lobby area, then lighted kerosene torches. There were so may kerosene torches lit all over the area (including bar, near pool etc.) and the smell was unbearable, air was unbreathable. Add 100C temperature and humidity to the situation and it was absolute hell. What was the point of this stupid show?

"I had the Heritance recommended from someone I know...clearly we have different taste or it was a different Heritance they stayed at. We booked this place for our last night in Sri Lanka as closer to Colombo and also looked lovely from the website. We so wished we had stayed at our gorgeous little boutique hotel in Mirissa instead! I won't make that mistake again...this is definitely a nice enough place for families or people looking for an all-in-one, resort experience, the beach is very pretty and so are the pools and lounge area with lots of grass and trees. Our room was OK but as many people say, 'tired' and not the cleanest ever, although a very good shower. The food, a buffet, was decent, but definitely nowhere near the food we had during our entire stay in Sri Lanka at a fraction of the cost. We had a hefty service charge added to our bill simply for ordering 1 bottle of wine at dinner! We booked a massage at the spa there which was good, and took advantage of the tennis courts. There are certainly plenty of facilities, but the various sales-people around selling tourist goods and palm readings made it that little bit more resorty/touristy for us. Overall, definitely not for the traveller who likes to stay less 'chainy' hotels (I was also enticed by their 'eco' claims but not sure I saw much to support it?) and I would not call it 5 star, but I probably made a mistake in booking it in the first place for what we wanted!",neutral,i had the heritance recommended from someone i knowclearly we have different taste or it wa a different heritance they stayed at we booked this place for our last night in sri lanka a closer to colombo and also looked lovely from the website we so wished we had stayed at our gorgeous little boutique hotel in mirissa instead i wont make that mistake againthis is definitely a nice enough place for family or people looking for an allinone resort experience the beach is very pretty and so are the pool and lounge area with lot of grass and tree our room wa ok but a many people say tired and not the cleanest ever although a very good shower the food a buffet wa decent but definitely nowhere near the food we had during our entire stay in sri lanka at a fraction of the cost we had a hefty service charge added to our bill simply for ordering bottle of wine at dinner we booked a massage at the spa there which wa good and took advantage of the tennis court there are certainly plenty of facility but the various salesperson around selling tourist good and palm reading made it that little bit more resortytouristy for u overall definitely not for the traveller who like to stay less chainy hotel i wa also enticed by their eco claim but not sure i saw much to support it and i would not call it star but i probably made a mistake in booking it in the first place for what we wanted,1450,265,4.475471698113208,4,0.9833,0.145,0.031,0.823,0.1720658866995074,0.5381308155446086

"This is a great hotel in many ways. It is a Bawa design so the actual structure and lay out of the resort is outstanding. The rooms are well appointed with great showers. But for the price and the history of the place I thought the resort could have been better. 1) The resort falls down in comparison to other world class hotels in the details. For example, every room is given a fruit basket designed to resemble a traditional Sri Lankan out rigger. This is a great touch but the problem is that the boat basket was quite broken and falling apart. It should have been replaced long ago. There are examples of this where a good idea is not quite executed correctly. Another example was the intrusion of more conventional resorts into the appearance of this heritage building: in the bar area upstairs there was a Red Bull fridge displayed quite prominently. Does anyone truly think Bawa would have approved of such a thing? Of course not. It disrupts the entire point of a place built by Bawa and damages the aesthetic. The managers should be aware of this. 2) The food was okay but was a mass produced buffet designed to accommodate a large number of people. This led to the food becoming pretty routine after a few days. We also found that it was difficult to get the attention of staff and I found they were not very attentive. Sometimes we had to ask twice for something simple like water. My feeling was that they were very understaffed. 3) A big issue for me was the mattresses. I have some muscular skeletal problems so sleeping on a hard bed is not good for me. But the beds at Ahungalla were very hard. In general I cannot understand why they would not get medium softness beds to accomodate everyone's needs. These may seem like small details, but for the price, for the fact it is a 5 star hotel, and because of its history and heritage, I think the place could do better. Having said that, it is certainly a considerable step up from the majority of large resorts on the SL coast.",neutral,this is a great hotel in many way it is a bawa design so the actual structure and lay out of the resort is outstanding the room are well appointed with great shower but for the price and the history of the place i thought the resort could have been better the resort fall down in comparison to other world class hotel in the detail for example every room is given a fruit basket designed to resemble a traditional sri lankan out rigger this is a great touch but the problem is that the boat basket wa quite broken and falling apart it should have been replaced long ago there are example of this where a good idea is not quite executed correctly another example wa the intrusion of more conventional resort into the appearance of this heritage building in the bar area upstairs there wa a red bull fridge displayed quite prominently doe anyone truly think bawa would have approved of such a thing of course not it disrupts the entire point of a place built by bawa and damage the aesthetic the manager should be aware of this the food wa okay but wa a mass produced buffet designed to accommodate a large number of people this led to the food becoming pretty routine after a few day we also found that it wa difficult to get the attention of staff and i found they were not very attentive sometimes we had to ask twice for something simple like water my feeling wa that they were very understaffed a big issue for me wa the mattress i have some muscular skeletal problem so sleeping on a hard bed is not good for me but the bed at ahungalla were very hard in general i can not understand why they would not get medium softness bed to accomodate everyones need these may seem like small detail but for the price for the fact it is a star hotel and because of it history and heritage i think the place could do better having said that it is certainly a considerable step up from the majority of large resort on the sl coast,1993,366,4.448087431693989,1,0.972,0.124,0.066,0.81,0.14027576955208532,0.5190383812094337

Since we didn't get a booking at the VIVANTA by Taj in Bentota we thought we'd try the Heritance. The property is run down and seems to have seen better days. A renovation should be on the cards sooner than later. We were upgraded to a suite named after the legendary Sachin Tendulkar but unfortunately the exhilaration of of the room or the hotel in no way matched the Little Master's batting. The room was ill-planned. No light switches and plug points in the right places, basins in which you couldn't splash your face, a Mini Bar fridge with a broken shelf, and never replenished, pathetic mal-functioning wifi...... and one could go on and on.... Minor glitches but collectively a huge nuisance for the price we paid. The biggest problem was the air-conditioning, never below 24 degrees Celsius. This in a hot and humid Bentota was a big problem. Two large swimming pools. Wow !! one for playing and kids and one for peaceful and serious swimmers like me. A Great idea! However the pleasure was short lived when we entered the pool. The water was cloudy and had particles flowing in it. Temperature was like soup. The Gym was exceedingly ill-equipped for the number of rooms. Only two treadmills, one of which was closed non-functional for the duration of my stay. One large dining area for buffets. One fine-dining restaurant but we never saw a living sole there in the 4 nights we spent. The food at the buffets were exceptional, but in case you're a vegetarian please be very careful. Options are very limited. Since large groups were coming in the buffet tables had huge queues. I for one am fond of nibbling tit bits going often to the table. But that was a Big no-no. Dealing with the lower staff is impossible. Not only is their a pathetic standard of English, many of them pretend to understand and say yes but things are not done. However I'd be failing in my duty if I didn't mention here, that the senior staff ably led by GM Mr Upul Peiris and the F&B Manager Gamini, were extremely courteous and helpful. Highly responsive. Problems brought to their notice were promptly attended to. I believe Mr Peiris has been here only for a few months. Seeing his leadership abilities and genuine concern for the customer I'm very sure these glitches should be a thing of the past very soon. The management needs to move from Responsiveness to Pro-activeness. My recommendation is to go here at a quiet time and not during peak season.",negative,a you enter the view of the beautiful pool merging into a pristine beach merging into the sea sweep you away unfortunately you dont get swept off your foot at this property since we didnt get a booking at the vivanta by taj in bentota we thought wed try the heritance the property is run down and seems to have seen better day a renovation should be on the card sooner than later we were upgraded to a suite named after the legendary sachin tendulkar but unfortunately the exhilaration of of the room or the hotel in no way matched the little master batting the room wa illplanned no light switch and plug point in the right place basin in which you couldnt splash your face a mini bar fridge with a broken shelf and never replenished pathetic malfunctioning wifi and one could go on and on minor glitch but collectively a huge nuisance for the price we paid the biggest problem wa the airconditioning never below degree celsius this in a hot and humid bentota wa a big problem two large swimming pool wow one for playing and kid and one for peaceful and serious swimmer like me a great idea however the pleasure wa short lived when we entered the pool the water wa cloudy and had particle flowing in it temperature wa like soup the gym wa exceedingly illequipped for the number of room only two treadmill one of which wa closed nonfunctional for the duration of my stay one large dining area for buffet one finedining restaurant but we never saw a living sole there in the night we spent the food at the buffet were exceptional but in case youre a vegetarian please be very careful option are very limited since large group were coming in the buffet table had huge queue i for one am fond of nibbling tit bit going often to the table but that wa a big nono dealing with the lower staff is impossible not only is their a pathetic standard of english many of them pretend to understand and say yes but thing are not done however id be failing in my duty if i didnt mention here that the senior staff ably led by gm mr upul peiris and the fb manager gamini were extremely courteous and helpful highly responsive problem brought to their notice were promptly attended to i believe mr peiris ha been here only for a few month seeing his leadership ability and genuine concern for the customer im very sure these glitch should be a thing of the past very soon the management need to move from responsiveness to proactiveness my recommendation is to go here at a quiet time and not during peak season,2629,466,4.643776824034335,3,0.9882,0.139,0.079,0.781,0.07235868156786525,0.5767557499190152

"We travelled with family on an outing, that had been planned a couple of months in advance. One of the members of our party is in a wheelchair and from the time of booking, this was mentioned as a special request. However, it was extremely difficult in getting confirmation from the hotel (both head office and hotel were contacted) if they were able to accommodate this guest. Several calls and emails went ignored and we resorted to calling a friend. This was extremely annoying as full paying customers you would like to think that the hotel would want to provide you with this basic service. A complaint made to the FB page provided some call back, but as always the trail went cold. We were unsure as to if this guest was able to make it, so in sheer desperation we had someone physically visit the hotel the week prior to our holiday and ask if they could be shown a few of the room categories, we were happy to upgrade if necessary. However, the person was not shown all categories and so the guest decided to only come for the day. Needless to say, we went there already disappointed with what the hotel had to offer. Once we checked in, we realised that one of our rooms was able to accommodate the guest in the wheelchair, and then proceeded to go to great lengths to ensure this guest joined us for the night. When we questioned the front desk as to why this room had not been shown to us, we were not given a valid response and we let it be, as we felt like we had already exerted way too much effort in what was meant to be a relaxing holiday! Needless to say, I felt like reservations, front desk and the head office staff were negligent and incompetent in this regard. Thereafter our trip went along smoothly, the staff were friendly and courteous and cooperated with requests such as bringing out a birthday cake. The rooms were clean and the common areas pleasant. It is a decent family hotel. The food was average at best, with no real highlights. Nice enough for a holiday with kids, but not good enough to compensate for all the hassle with the levels of initial service rendered.",negative,we travelled with family on an outing that had been planned a couple of month in advance one of the member of our party is in a wheelchair and from the time of booking this wa mentioned a a special request however it wa extremely difficult in getting confirmation from the hotel both head office and hotel were contacted if they were able to accommodate this guest several call and email went ignored and we resorted to calling a friend this wa extremely annoying a full paying customer you would like to think that the hotel would want to provide you with this basic service a complaint made to the fb page provided some call back but a always the trail went cold we were unsure a to if this guest wa able to make it so in sheer desperation we had someone physically visit the hotel the week prior to our holiday and ask if they could be shown a few of the room category we were happy to upgrade if necessary however the person wa not shown all category and so the guest decided to only come for the day needless to say we went there already disappointed with what the hotel had to offer once we checked in we realised that one of our room wa able to accommodate the guest in the wheelchair and then proceeded to go to great length to ensure this guest joined u for the night when we questioned the front desk a to why this room had not been shown to u we were not given a valid response and we let it be a we felt like we had already exerted way too much effort in what wa meant to be a relaxing holiday needless to say i felt like reservation front desk and the head office staff were negligent and incompetent in this regard thereafter our trip went along smoothly the staff were friendly and courteous and cooperated with request such a bringing out a birthday cake the room were clean and the common area pleasant it is a decent family hotel the food wa average at best with no real highlight nice enough for a holiday with kid but not good enough to compensate for all the hassle with the level of initial service rendered,2100,387,4.428940568475452,5,0.9927,0.155,0.065,0.78,0.07070267131242741,0.5662020905923345

"Heritance Ahungalla is always our first choice when I and my partner visit Sri Lanka. I have stayed in this hotel more than 20 times over the last few years and, there is nothing else in Sri Lanka to beat its architectural beauty, tranquility, beautiful sandy beaches, friendly staff and their hospitality, and great food choices. All our work stresses and worries just disappear into the thin air as soon as we walk into the lobby of the hotel for the first time. Friendly welcome from the staff and the glance of the hotel environment with the infinity pool and the sound of the sea waves set the tone for the rest of our holiday. We love to come to Herritance to celebrate Christmas and the New Year since they organise a fabulous dinner with amazing food buffet with ice sculptures and food decorations which is out of this world, dance shows, fireworks and music by a great band. This experience is heavenly under the stars with the sound of the sea. What is unbeatable in this hotel, compared to other hotels in Sri Lanka, is the friendliness and the quality of the staff who works their. This goes from the General Manager to all the managers, to the waiters who serve at the restaurant, to the cleaning staff, and to the pool staff. They are always their to do their best to make our stay a memorable experience. I would like to give a special mention to Duminda and Waruna at the restaurant who always made sure we have an amazing dinning experience. Rukmal, the towel artist, make fabulous animal figures with towels and surprise us every morning as we come back to our room after breakfast. Pool attendants are always there to prepare our sun-beds every morning. We love walking along the sandy beach in front of the hotel in the morning and also in the evening and enjoy the evening sunset and then dive into the pool for a final swim before getting ready for the dinner. One day we wanted to organise a special dinner on the beach for a friend and his family to celebrate his retirement. The staff went out of their way to organise this dinner with fabulous food and assigned dedicated staff to serve the food. It was an unforgettable experience. I recommend this for couples if you are interested in organising a romantic dinner or for any special events to mark the occasion. I hope to be back again in the summer to re-live this beautiful experience.",positive,heritance ahungalla is always our first choice when i and my partner visit sri lanka i have stayed in this hotel more than time over the last few year and there is nothing else in sri lanka to beat it architectural beauty tranquility beautiful sandy beach friendly staff and their hospitality and great food choice all our work stress and worry just disappear into the thin air a soon a we walk into the lobby of the hotel for the first time friendly welcome from the staff and the glance of the hotel environment with the infinity pool and the sound of the sea wave set the tone for the rest of our holiday we love to come to herritance to celebrate christmas and the new year since they organise a fabulous dinner with amazing food buffet with ice sculpture and food decoration which is out of this world dance show firework and music by a great band this experience is heavenly under the star with the sound of the sea what is unbeatable in this hotel compared to other hotel in sri lanka is the friendliness and the quality of the staff who work their this go from the general manager to all the manager to the waiter who serve at the restaurant to the cleaning staff and to the pool staff they are always their to do their best to make our stay a memorable experience i would like to give a special mention to duminda and waruna at the restaurant who always made sure we have an amazing dinning experience rukmal the towel artist make fabulous animal figure with towel and surprise u every morning a we come back to our room after breakfast pool attendant are always there to prepare our sunbeds every morning we love walking along the sandy beach in front of the hotel in the morning and also in the evening and enjoy the evening sunset and then dive into the pool for a final swim before getting ready for the dinner one day we wanted to organise a special dinner on the beach for a friend and his family to celebrate his retirement the staff went out of their way to organise this dinner with fabulous food and assigned dedicated staff to serve the food it wa an unforgettable experience i recommend this for couple if you are interested in organising a romantic dinner or for any special event to mark the occasion i hope to be back again in the summer to relive this beautiful experience,2366,426,4.556338028169014,6,0.9987,0.232,0.015,0.753,0.36494338994339004,0.6055398305398306

"This ought to be a great hotel but it ends up only being a good one. It lets itself down on a couple of fronts. First the good - the food is excellent both in the main restaurant and the fine dining restaurant. In particular we were very impressed with the team that look after the pool bar and the fine dining room. Worthy of particular mention are the guys in Lakmal's team including Dilan, Kolitha and Silva who were chatty without being intrusive and went out of their way to help. Dinesh made sure that a birthday celebration in the fine dining restaurant was special and memorable. Also the pools are very large and the main pool is really beautiful. The hotel is justifiably proud of having been designed by Sri Lanka's most celebrated architect Geoffrey Bawa. The view as you arrive at reception is fantastic looking right through the hotel lobby and over the beach to the sea. Unfortunately our experience of the front desk staff is they manage to be both obsequious and a bit too full of how good they think the hotel is at the same time. We were particularly annoyed when they failed to pass on two important messages from our tour operator. The rooms also look the part at first but fall victim to style over substance. There are so many hotel 'ornaments' that you have to clear loads of stuff out of the way to put your own belongings away. The light over the desk is hung so low that you bang your head on it whilst it manages to keep the mirror above the desk in complete shade. You have to ring housekeeping to ask for many of the things we found provided automatically in other hotels such as adaptors and mosquito repellers. You also need to make use of the Do Not Disturb sign pretty much whenever you are in the room or you are likely to find your bed being turned down at 6 in the evening! We also experienced power failures on almost every evening - not the end of the world in themselves but it would have been nice to have had a torch in the room instead of sitting in complete darkness until the power came back on. The bathroom was one of the biggest disappointments as it only contain a shower. We asked twice about moving to a room with a bath and once were told there were no rooms with baths and the second time were asked for $100 per night to move to a room with a bath. On both occassions we were told we could use the jacuzzi near the resident's pool if we wanted a bath although we were never brave enough to stroll down there in the altogether with our soap and shampoo! The jacuzzi is actually a cheap plastic afterthought that would have Mr Bawa turning in his grave. In summary this hotel did not impress as much as other hotels we stayed in during our trip. It charged for things such as internet usage and had not done a great job of anticpating our needs in a way that other hotels did that did not cost anywhere near as much as this one and it would probably not be on our list of places to go back to or to recommend on that basis.",neutral,this ought to be a great hotel but it end up only being a good one it let itself down on a couple of front first the good the food is excellent both in the main restaurant and the fine dining restaurant in particular we were very impressed with the team that look after the pool bar and the fine dining room worthy of particular mention are the guy in lakmals team including dilan kolitha and silva who were chatty without being intrusive and went out of their way to help dinesh made sure that a birthday celebration in the fine dining restaurant wa special and memorable also the pool are very large and the main pool is really beautiful the hotel is justifiably proud of having been designed by sri lankas most celebrated architect geoffrey bawa the view a you arrive at reception is fantastic looking right through the hotel lobby and over the beach to the sea unfortunately our experience of the front desk staff is they manage to be both obsequious and a bit too full of how good they think the hotel is at the same time we were particularly annoyed when they failed to pas on two important message from our tour operator the room also look the part at first but fall victim to style over substance there are so many hotel ornament that you have to clear load of stuff out of the way to put your own belonging away the light over the desk is hung so low that you bang your head on it whilst it manages to keep the mirror above the desk in complete shade you have to ring housekeeping to ask for many of the thing we found provided automatically in other hotel such a adaptor and mosquito repellers you also need to make use of the do not disturb sign pretty much whenever you are in the room or you are likely to find your bed being turned down at in the evening we also experienced power failure on almost every evening not the end of the world in themselves but it would have been nice to have had a torch in the room instead of sitting in complete darkness until the power came back on the bathroom wa one of the biggest disappointment a it only contain a shower we asked twice about moving to a room with a bath and once were told there were no room with bath and the second time were asked for per night to move to a room with a bath on both occassions we were told we could use the jacuzzi near the resident pool if we wanted a bath although we were never brave enough to stroll down there in the altogether with our soap and shampoo the jacuzzi is actually a cheap plastic afterthought that would have mr bawa turning in his grave in summary this hotel did not impress a much a other hotel we stayed in during our trip it charged for thing such a internet usage and had not done a great job of anticpating our need in a way that other hotel did that did not cost anywhere near a much a this one and it would probably not be on our list of place to go back to or to recommend on that basis,2975,566,4.257950530035336,5,0.9873,0.127,0.077,0.796,0.24144752428334518,0.5657190239279792

"Heritance Ahungalle was definitely worth a stay in Ahungalle. It's located right on the edge of Galle Road and is easily accessible. The check-in & check-out was fast, efficient and seamless. The staff was very polite and warm. The rooms (although a little dated) have star-class amenities (hot water, kettle, tea/coffee, TV, free WIFI etc). The beach is just near the hotel and the two large swimming pools offer a very good time to relax! My only complaint is with regards to the food.

Bathrooms - Urs was spacious with music and a good showerplace. Other 3 bathrooms were very old and aging. the walls were no tiled as well and only concrete was seen. They were very small as well. Very disappointed. Food - This was a beachside restaurant but the buffet was not good at all. there were very few varieties of food and the only seafood for dinner was fish and prawns.

"Okay it's one of the best hotel is Sri Lanka, it has won the award of best leisure hotel by the minister of tourism. Sure, the two pools are outstanding, the rooms are nice, the area is quiet and the beach is nice but... staying there we kept asking ourselves: is it how one should experience Sri Lanka beaches? Just before we stayed at Mirissa, a lovely beach with a lot of atmosphere, a couple small hotels and guest houses, a few waterfront bars and a great laid back atmosphere. The Heritance is the opposite. Big resort where you pay over-priced drink and food served by stylish staff. The hotel probably owns the beach, because there is nothing else around. Would advice to go there if you don't mind missing the charm of more ""informal places"". Compare to other places, we found the contact with the locals to be biased. It's either hotel staff or very insisting beach sellers. The later can be quite annoying especially when the seat in group of 8-10 just in front of your chair and stay all day long. The food was not exceptional, certainly not in line with the price they ask for it (in Sri Lankan terms of course!).",neutral,okay it one of the best hotel is sri lanka it ha won the award of best leisure hotel by the minister of tourism sure the two pool are outstanding the room are nice the area is quiet and the beach is nice but staying there we kept asking ourselves is it how one should experience sri lanka beach just before we stayed at mirissa a lovely beach with a lot of atmosphere a couple small hotel and guest house a few waterfront bar and a great laid back atmosphere the heritance is the opposite big resort where you pay overpriced drink and food served by stylish staff the hotel probably owns the beach because there is nothing else around would advice to go there if you dont mind missing the charm of more informal place compare to other place we found the contact with the local to be biased it either hotel staff or very insisting beach seller the later can be quite annoying especially when the seat in group of just in front of your chair and stay all day long the food wa not exceptional certainly not in line with the price they ask for it in sri lankan term of course,1126,206,4.470873786407767,5,0.9723,0.153,0.047,0.8,0.1964514652014652,0.5151404151404152

"The room itself was okay, relatively clean and fair in size. My biggest issue with the stay was that, when relaxing or walking on the beach, there were around 15ish street merchants constantly harassing me and other guests to buy their clothes (at extortionate prices compared to going to a local shop or market), as well as being badgered to book tours, again at 2-3 times the price when booking away from the beach. I have to point out that these were not hotel employees, but independent traders whom for some reason had access to the hotel every day we stayed there. The hotel offers a baggage handling service where they will move your bags to and from your room for you free of charge, however, be vigilant as personal items were stolen from our luggage between us leaving the room to checkout, and our bags being moved by one of the staff members. In all honesty, I have stayed at many hotels in different countries and I would say, this is the one time I have gone on holiday and not felt like I was actually on holiday as there was just that much badgering going on that it was almost impossible to relax. Upon walking out of the front gates of the hotel, you would have 4-5 tuk tuk drivers ask and try to take you to places you have repeatedly told them you do not wish to go and although this is not the hotel's fault, when it happens every single day, I feel as though it has to be mentioned.

"We visited this hotel at the end of a group tour and were very disappointed with our accommodation. The other members of the group were given different quality rooms despite having paid the same and were mostly very happy but our room was unacceptable. ( I think from the website images it was a ‘deluxe’ room with partial sea view) The electrics in this part of the hotel were obviously in need of urgent renovation. Two of the plug sockets were damaged with melted plastic around the pin holes and the air conditioning would only work at all by fiddling with the slider switch on the wall and then went off again after a couple of minutes. We complained and a manager said they would sort out the plug sockets the next day but asserted that the air conditioning WAS working although obviously it was not and the room remained very warm. Apparently the hotel was fully booked and there was nothing he could do about it. I was online looking for alternative accommodation when the situation was resolved by our tour guide who generously swopped rooms with us and this room was lovely. Although the electrics were our main complaint, the room also smelled damp and was generally in need of renovation, not really five star. The rest of the hotel was very good and the restaurant was excellent so our experience was a great shame.

"HOTEL: We stayed at the Heritance for 10 Nights. The hotel and staff are lovely. After reading a previous review about being to scared to leave the room, i feel that this is an insult the the hard working staff there. At no point did we feel we threatened by staff, housekeeping staff smiled and never asked for a tip and the same said with the staff in the bar area. I suppose the hotel could do with a lick of paint but as for broken sunbeds i didnt see any, and there was always loads to choose from. The only negative thing about the room is the size of the fridge which is very small. But again it wasnt a real problem. YES.. you tip for most things but we never felt preasured to do so, and even if you do its 100rs at a time! The sellers on the beach are a bit of a pain, but a firm no and they go off to the next person, and after a while getting the same response from us they didnt even bother. Our room was on the 3rd floor and it was lovely, and we even had our own little gekcho which was great for eating insects. Our room was cleaned twice a day with clean towels and more water. The food was lovely, the only downside is there isnt much options for vegitarians. The only major downside with ther Heritance was location. when we travel we like to go out and try local resturants which is why we booked b&b, however other then the little fish resturant (which is cheap with lovely food) along the beach there isnt anything walking distance. We did take a taxi RS3500 (that waited 3hrs and brought us back to the hotel) to Hikkaduwa where you'll find bars/resturants and several rotty cafe. If we'd of known this we would of booked HB as we ended up spending most evenings eating in the hotel. TOURS: We did several trips whilst in Sri Lanka. The first to Uda Walawe park, as much as it was a long drive it was lovely to see the elephants roaming around freely, its def worth a visit. We then did a 2 day trip to Kandy and Sigiriya again a lot of driving, we stopped off at a tea shop on the way which was ok, then the botanical gardens which is a lovely place to sit with an ice cream and watch the world go by. We then went to the temple of tooth which was lovely, and to be honest go without a guide as ours was a bit of an idiot trying to get us to pay for him to study etc etc.. which we felt was very cheeky whilst inside a buddhist temple!!! In Kandy We stayed at Chaaya Citadel which was lovely and great food, to be honest it was a shame we only stayed the night. The next day we had an early start and more driving to Sigiriya, this was via a spice market and to be honest at 830am we probably wasnt the most awake customers!! but we listened and left! Once we arrived at Sigirya we headed up the many steps in the mid morning heat!!! the views at the top are lovely and make for great photos, they even had a family of monkeys that live on the top. Then it was the 7hr drive back to the hotel. Be warned your driver will take you to various tea/gem and spice shops!!!! We asked our driver if we could skip these but its something they have to do, even though we put our foot down and said no to the gem store.

"So it seems that even though we booked a 5⭐ hotel, we were unlucky to get the most outdated dirty rooms I've ever seen in such highly rated hotel. I always judge my room by the condition of the bathroom. The bathrooms here in both rooms were so dirty. The shower was the worst. The shower screen was completely covered by soap scum. The tiles were mouldy. Clearly the housekeeping had not heard of bleach or sugar soap or any kind of deep cleaning. Even run down hotels can be presented well with proper maintenance & care. These rooms don't deserve anymore than 3⭐ rating. Very disappointed. The food outlets however were fantastic. We dined at 3 outlets during our stay and each area was superb. Food was delicious. Best buffet food I've experienced this time in SL. The service was equally incredible. We travel with a toddler and we can demanding however the team made it so pleasant for us. Thanks you F&B team.

I saw a couple of brocken links and informed them but they did not respond back to me... I was a bit skeptical as a 5 star hotel needs to keep its web site 5 star. My skeptism was correct when I went there... I felt the staff was not bothered about good service. They were in general NOT FRIENDLY. The hotel I found not to be well maintained. Things are getting old and discoloured. They did not have a changing room for the pool. Thus you need to change in your room and go. Through the hotel to the pool (I am talking about the main pool).

The pools are very pleasant and well set out. The size of the room was good, and the aircon worked well without being too noisy. Drinks were reaonably priced - large beer £1.20, cocktail typically £3.75. Negatives: the building is over thirty years old and doesn't really look as though it has had a proper makeover at any time. It looks a bit tired. Although the staff try hard, they are bit chaotic and prone to mistakes when it is busy. On arrival, the wrong bags were sent to our room, and despite me making this clear, the porter seemed determined to leave them with me - a minor gripe, but typifies things.

"I booked three rooms at half-board and came with my wife, 20 month old daughter and wife's relatives for two nights in September 2013. I was keen to experience a Geoffrey Bawa architected hotel and was impressed by the thoughtfulness of his design. The hotel aims to merge with nature, and allow for breezes to flow throughout the compound, providing a natural cooling. There were two pools, which we well maintained and a great place to lounge through during the day. I was very keen to experience the food at the hotel - as I had heard that it was rated as one of the best dining resorts in Sri Lanka and I was not disappointed. I was struck by the thoughtfulness of the dishes in the Jute restaurant - and also couldn't recall any dish tasting bad. All the food was balanced and tasty. Even the Sri Lankan food was unbelievably good. The staff were helpful and always with a smile. Also enjoyed the gym, badmington court and table tennis facility in the venue. The only negative for me was the reasonable isolation of the resort. As I tend to always like to explore the surroundings, I was a bit disappointed when leaving the resort by the lack of facilities around walking distance of the hotel.

I work for a top tour operator in england and have travelled around the world staying at many top hotels. The service at the Heritance matched, if not exceeded many of these. The pools were fantastic...clean, great suze and we had one of the two at leat to ourselves on many occasions..it was great!! Below are some further comments: Room - was brilliant. It was a great size, really nicely furnished, clean with a great bathroom. Great views to pool and ocean. Cleaned daily. Food - amazing! we were on ahalf board basis and te food was superb. Great choice, different them every day, fresh, beautiful curries! Service - amazing. The staff were so attentive it was incredible. They were polite and friendly all the time. They alwas say hello and and make a real rapport with you throughout the time we were there. Beach - lovely but you do get hounded a bit by the touts when you walk on it. Just ignore them if you want them to leave you alone. Theyre firendly though. The sea is a bit rough so you cant really swim in it. Touts - if you want to get a taxi just ask one of the touts for a tuk tuk Its so much cheaper than the hotel taxis. We had the same driver for the whole 10 days and he was great. He took us to lots of places cheaply and was a safe driver. Dont be scared to use one..youll probably be a bit nervous the first time you get in one but then you can get their number and as soon as you want to go somewheer give them a call and theyll come and pick you up. Overall..couldnt fault our time at the heritance in any way. Ive read some of the negative reviews on this site and cant really understand what theyre on about.

"We ended our tour around Sri Lanka with a couple of nights at the Heritance Ahungalla. The hotel is well situated by the beach and we enjoyed walking along the shore watching the ocean roll in. We arrived with high expectations given all the five star reviews, but our experience did not live up to this. The bathroom in our room was disappointing for a 5 star hotel - small, bare plaster (not sure whether the room was being redecorated or this was the intended 'vibe') and the door wedged on the floor every time you tried to open it. The handle came off a drawer in the bedroom as the staff showed us the room when we checked in. On a positive note, breakfasts were buffet style with a very wide selection. Rather than accept the 'special offer' to upgrade to half board on arrival, we ate a la carte for dinners which meant we could choose what we wanted and this turned out to be much more cost effective than the half board offer/buffet. When we ate at the Mustard the place was very quiet, but we were rushed by the waiting staff - main courses arriving when we were half through our starters and left on the table, and dessert offered and our plates whipped away as we enjoyed the last mouthful of main course. Why the experience had to be rushed when the place was far from busy I don't know, perhaps the service could be most generously described as 'over eager'. This is a good hotel in a nice location. Staff were friendly.

"The hotel looks lovely and the rooms are very nice - large, airy and tastefully furnished in a modern take on traditional. Wonderful big comfortable bed, excellent rain shower, big flat screen TV, minbar, generous safe and covered private balcony. Public areas are open plan and also look very nice - until you spot the package operator signs & programs, hear the scream of children in the pool (right beside the only bar & lounge) and realise the predominant language is Russian. Service is hit and miss - there are some excellent staff who cannot do enough to please, but there is also a lot of inexperience and a shortage of staff for the number of guests - leading to some extremely poor service experiences (eg. Wine ordered at dinner not arriving until after dessert; dirty plates left on tables for long periods; tables not properly cleaned between use; buffet dishes not replenished; etc.) The food quality in the buffet is poor - tough cuts of meat, over cooked curries and left out/not refreshed very often. Even at the fresh food stations the ingredients were not top quality and over cooked - and at best all the dishes are luke warm. Breakfast was no better - some good curries, but otherwise heavy doughy croissants, ‘butter’ that was in fact margarine, a couple of cheap jams, limited selection of fruit and one person cooking eggs and another cooking hoppers for the 100s of guests. To round it off - the majority of the wine list was unavailable (excuse being difficulty with supply chain due to pandemic - but the other hotels on our tour hadn’t suffered the same problems), as were a number of items on the pool bar snack menu. The sl a carte restaurant and the other bars / coffee shop weren’t open either.

"Absolutely wonderful! The resort was a tranquil haven set away from the busy main road and made you feel like you have just stepped into paradise. The hotel is beautifully laid out, allowing you to go from swimming in the pool to swimming in the ocean with just a few steps along a very private beach. The architecture is stunning. The hotel had a wide array of amenities like 2 pools (one with Jacuzzi), bars, restaurants, a library, tennis court, spa, putting green, gym, loads of games, etc which I felt made it ideal for either couples or families. There were always activities for both children and adults like mask painting, water aerobics, traditional dances, etc but they were unobtrusive, allowing you to either be entertained or just relax in peace around the pool, without being bothered. The rooms were beautiful, comfortable and cleaned spotlessly every day. The service was outstanding with smiling happy faces greeting you wherever you go. Nothing seemed too much trouble to do and they made you feel like you were part of the family, not just an anonymous guest. Special thanks to KK who made us feel like we were royalty every day and went out of his way to help us experience Sri Lankan culture. The food was spectacular with a wonderful mix of Sri Lankan and international dishes.

This was our first time visiting heritance ahungalle and we were looking forward to a relaxing weekend. First up when we arrived our room wasn't ready and even though I had specifically requested for a king size bed since we were travelling with our son instead of individual beds this too was not taken into account. After sitting in the lobby for over 30 minutes we were finally taken up to our room . The luggage however was not brought to the room and after waiting a good 30 minutes we had to go looking for it. As for the food we found it to be basic and lacking in flavour. Breakfast was much better as it had a variety with many local dishes and seasoning. I found it bizarre that very little seafood was on the menu being a sea side hotel. The staff were attentive and went to the extent of asking if anything special was required for our son.

"My wife and I had a two week holiday here in December. Weather was good and we did trips to Yala National Park (4 hours by car) and Kandy (4 hours by car). I list below the positives and the negatives of our holiday. Positives : Good food in restaurant buffet with a different daily menu. Friendly and generally helpful staff throughout the hotel. Excellent sea view from our first floor bedroom balcony. Excellent sea front location offering lovely beach walks. Two very large and spacious swimming pools kept clean. Room very clean and some wonderful animal shaped towels kept us amused. International plug sockets, always a help. Good size balcony. Much needed cold drinks upon arrival. Clean sheets and towels daily. Large 50"" TV in bedroom. (A negative for us as we don't watch TV but probably a positive for others). Plenty of colourful bird life in the hotel grounds. And so to the negatives. No Jacuzzi for our entire stay. When we enquired we were told they were waiting for a part but by the time we left the Jacuzzi was looking very grubby with gathered dropped leaves and rainwater. Alcoholic drinks were expensive particularly a small glass of wine with dinner. Costly alcoholic drinks turned up very quickly at dinner but not the free water. On several occasions I had to ask three times for water. Lack of local railway train information at reception. No postcards sold at the hotel. We had air conditioning problems in our room which took a while to resolve. The plug in the wash basin didn't operate properly. No curtain in the bathroom for the first three days of our stay. Wobbly fan on the ceiling (maybe it was meant to be like that !). Wobbly bedside table definitely shouldn't be like that. Nowhere to walk to / have a coffee/beer/snack out the front of the hotel (busy road). That's even if you manage to get past the tour guides who hover by the hotel gates. Lack of lighting at night between the hotel front and the hotel gates. Insufficient staff in the restaurant when busy. This was particularly noticeable at weekends. Noisy building work being carried out on one wing of the hotel during the day. Some of these points might seem petty but added together it wasn't the holiday my wife and I had hoped for. Would definitely recommend Yala National Park. A visit to a Turtle hatchery. The Botanical gardens at Kandy.

"Heritance Ahungalla is not by any standards a 4,5 star hotel. We have chosen it for our honeymoon trip as pictures seen on the website looked amazing and we also read many good reviews. However, our stay there turn out to be a great dissapointment and we won't be going back. To list just few problems you may encounter there : it is impossible to go for a walk on the beach as you are constantly pestered by locals who do not take no for an answer; cockroaches can be found not only on hotel corridors but also inside the rooms; the cutlery served at tables has leftovers of food stuck to it; the bed linen in the rooms as well as the curtains are stained and often with holes; the hotel provides hardly any toiletries and if so, they are stuck on the bottom of a ceramic bottles in a very small quantitiy; there are constant problems with electricity and it can go off for over 30mins at time. As for the service it is probably one of the most tiresom and annoying problems of all, as there is no communication between the team members serving meals in the restaurant, you need to ask several times for a pot of coffee or a bottle of water, provided that you will be understood by the waiter on the first occassion. If so, the requested drink may not be delivered at all, while few other team memers will approach with exactly the same question about your choice of drink but it will take ages for someone to actually deliver it to the table. The tips are expected while the service quality or rather its lack, does not jusitfy it at all. The most imposing are often the housekeeping supervisors (not the regular housekeepers- they work very hard and hardly ever strike a conversation with a guest), who can follow you down the corridor repeating few times that they are entirely responsible for cleaning your room....all obviously to be tipped. In case of any problems with the room calling reception is normally a waste of time, as you have to call back several times before someone turns up to deal with the problem. The hotel is full of damp and looks as if its times of glory have long gone.

"Having spent many holidays along the beautiful west coast of Sri Lanka, trying out the various hotels over the years, I can honestly say that Heritance Ahungalla is my favourite. Convenient to get to from Colombo on the new Expressway, it is situated about 90 kilometers from Colombo. From the moment I drive up to the entrance with the fantastic view right up to the sea, I feel at home. There is such a feeling of peace and serenity with the warm yet gentle welcome from the staff. I have requested sea view rooms and have never been disappointed. Room 305 is my favourite. If you like tasty food and lots of it, Heritance Ahungalla is the place to be. I think their chefs are about the best in Sri Lanka. The buffet has a huge selection of dishes to please the western and local palate. The salads varied and desserts yummy. Heritance has two attractive large swimming pools, and also a very attractive beach. The seas around Sri Lanka can be dangerous around monsoon time, but if you love messing around in the shallow water, going for long walks or just sun bathing it is wonderful. I strongly recommend Heritance Ahungalla, if you want a relaxing holiday. I always come away feeling rested and energized wishing I could stay longer!

"We decided to stay at Heritance Ahungalla as it was designed by an architect that we like - Geoffrey Bawa. Later we realized so are many hotels en route Ahungalla from Colombo. Having said that, it sure is a beautiful hotel with two vast pools overlooking the beach. The brand is all about the blend of tradition and modernity. The service staff were all in their white sarongs with white shirts. The rooms were a bit disappointing. We requested for a triple room and realized that it is a double with an extra bed. We really thought there would be more space. The maintenance was not as good and lamp shades were falling off. For a property of that size and price the in-room amenities were dated including a large tube television that juts into the walk path. There were a lot of renovation going on and we had to walk through scaffolding all the time. We also had this noon drills and plumbing noise that would not let us take that much needed siesta. The food was again a strong blend of Lankan and Continental. I was ok with an odd piece of dried fish in my food. My wife and kids were not. So I had to taste the dishes before they ate. But the traditional food was enjoyable and we gorged. There is a fine dining restaurant in the property and I would rate that very high. The pools were fabulous - clean, well maintained and addictive. The gym was old, grubby and rusted (most of the equipment were not usable). When we go to Sri Lanka again we will not go south as it is intended to rip off unsuspecting tourists. And so we will not stay at Heritance Ahungalla either. I think all properties in that stretch of Bentota, Ahungalla are overrated.

"We stayed here for 2 weeks at the end of March and first week of April. Mostly, I would agree the previous writer's review. If you wish to really see Sri Lanka then I would suggest that you stay here at the end of your holiday as it is quite far south and means that travel to places such as Kandy are extremely long and tiresome and the driving is something else to be seen, I would describe it as a 'white knuckle ride'!. The hotel is well designed but I would struggle to place it in the 4-5* bracket (try out hotels in Malaysia and you will really see the difference). There is a so called shop in the hotel which really does not sell any essentials such as shampoo so make sure you take your own hair products. Also, we bought factor 40 sun tan cream which did not work and we were severely burned (another couple had the same experience) so again, make sure you take your own sun tan creams and after sun with you. Regarding the beach terrorists, they do hassle you. We were followed for an hour on the beach by 5 of them who just would not give up, no matter how politely you said you weren't interested. They called and shouted to you if you were sunbathing near the beach and the only thing to do was to completely ignore them. One day we went outside the hotel to go the the pharmacy to buy some after sun lotion (due to the rubbish cream the shop had sold) and found exactly the same hassle, we lasted about 20 minutes before going back to the hotel. Our room smelled damp when we initially entered and the air con never seemed cool, the staff knocked on the door daily, sometimes 4-5 times to check the room was ok. However, I think this had more to do with wanting a tip. One time they completely ignored the 'do not disturb sign' and still persisted. The restaurant did offer a very good selection (buffet style) and quality of food, the only thing that let it down was the length of time it took you to get a drink when requested, especially as the ratio of staff to customers was overwhelming at times.

"This is a strange one, to be sure. With a few tweeks it could be one of the best beach hotels you'll ever stay in anywhere, but in the comparison with other places we stayed in Sri Lanka (and particularly Mount Lavinia), it just seems to fall short in areas that it would be so easy to correct. The setting, design and physical feel of the hotel are all quite stunning. But right away you get those little irksome contrasts that make this a frustrating place. Complacency abounds and you sense that they are still all patting themselves on the back for being able to re-open after the devastation of the Tsunami (yes those dreadful Youtube videos from Boxing Day 2004 were from balconies at The Triton, which has now become The Heritance). Positive sentiment isn't quite enough at the 5 star level unfortunately. It sits behind a gorgeous stretch of beach with surf that you just are dying to play in just 50 feet away - but to get from hotel gardens to the sea, you have to pass an almost comically persistent group of beach tradespeople each time. The hotel has a line of flags to keep them at bay, but the security staff still let them bother you from a distance when you are on a sun lounger by the pool. Would you get accosted by a panhandler on the steps of the Waldorf Astoria as you left to get in your cab? The sidewalk is public space but things can be done..... The two pools are large and magnificent, with the green pool so huge it even allows you to ""length swim"". There is also a gym with fairly up to date equipment, but its functionality was comprised every day of my stay by an inability of staff to get the message (despite 3 reminders in 3 days) that the aircon needs to be on and set to below 28 degs C for anyone to be able to use it. The minimalist design of the public areas has an overall calming effect on you, but with the architect apparently having a veto on everything, this extends to a lack of many of the features that you expect in any large resort - an excursions / news board; signs to different areas; names on the bars etc. We had little to complain about the food. In fact it was fairly reasonably priced for a putative 5 star, but it had little real wow factor, and apart from some of the local dishes on the buffet menu, it just scraped by. Last year we stayed on Meeru Island resort in the Maldives and despite the obvious abundance of produce in Sri Lanka compared to a coral attol, Meeru's buffets were both more inspiring and much cheaper. The room was spacious with a big balcony - as it should be for just over $300 a night! But the bathroom was blatantly unfinished with two walls smooth plastered but not painted. Some guests demanded a room change for this - we were told it was a design feature (see photo). With such a huge balcony a sun lounger rather than just 2 chairs and a table would have been an idea. And why oh why was there no rack to dry wet clothes. There was plenty of space, but maybe the architect had his say there as well. All the staff we interacted with were cheerful and accommodating, apart from the reception staff who were a bit feckless and needed to be a little more proactive. We were invited to a cocktail party given by the assistant manager, and found him charming and with an earnest concerned approach to some of the criticisms we gently raised. It really did not sit well however to be told that the beach sellers were tolerated on a ""better the devil you know"" basis and that other ""newer"" nationalities amongst the clientele liked having them around. I am not so sure the Heritance is that well advised to try to imitate Sharm El Sheikh at these prices. Lose the traditional customer base and I think they will lose much of their trade to the likes of Mount Lavinia. If you were to stay here and, as we are, you are fairly easy going if the weather is good, (as it was), you will probably be happy enough at the Heritance, give or take the $100 or so a night that should still be in your wallet. But I can imagine it could quite quickly become a nightmare in bad weather. You even had to pay to play on the pool table. Free pool if you spend 1500 rupees on drinks - come on! To end on a positive note of a review which I had intended to be somewhat more complimentary than it has turned out, the laissez-faire approach has allowed wildlife to remain on the grounds undisturbed. To see massive Iguanas digging for crabs next to your sun-lounger while chipmunks frolic around on your umbrella stand is a uniquely warming feeling. We were even able to film troupes of monkeys and even pass them mango pieces to eat on the branches of trees by the pool.

"One thing which makes Heritance Hotels stand out is the food and hospitality. So I had high expectations. I have already been to Kandalama and Negambo, in both cuisine and hospitality is great and flawless. The first thing I noted is that they (Heritance Ahungalla) cannot handle a crowd. No welcome drinks for some of the guests. Very few (sometimes none) food options to vegetarians. The restaurant space was not enough when crowded. Service is really bad at the restaurant. Several times we had to ask for water and wait for it. Both Negambo and Kandalama is excellent in service where they event do not let the water glass finish in any of the tables. So lot of improvement is needed. And it is noted that the service is delayed not because the staff is very busy, but because there are some idle staff as well. More organization is needed. Rooms are okay. The first day there were only one shower cap in the room. The other shower cap box is empty. On top of that, the second day, there were no soap. Even the soap from the previous day has been removed. Location is okay. Nice pools.

"The beginning of the holiday started in a very disappointing way. We arrived at the hotel at 2PM on time for check in. However we were informed that the rooms were not ready. As a result we had to wait for over two and a half hours to get our rooms which was a very disappointing experience to start a vacation. The excuse given by the staff was that the guests have not vacated the rooms on time. This is not a plausible excuse. The hotel should know when to call and inform guests that they need to check out on time. The least they could do then is call us and let us know there is a delay so that we can plan to arrive late to the hotel. My mother who is elderly had to sit for along time in the reception area and found it difficult to walk afterwords as well. We actually decided never to come back to this hotel again but we changed our minds after the experience afterwards. The staff in the hotel mainly the room maintenance and restaurant staff were very polite friendly and courteous. Never before had we experienced such a good service from staff in any other hotels we had been to. Another plus point was the food. The food was excellent. There was a wide variety and it was very tasty. One negative aspect is that we stayed one night on a day where there were less guests. On this day the food variety was not there and that was a bit of a undermining experience for us. Another unsatisfactory experience I faced was with the pool attendant. When I went to the swimming pool I asked the pool attendant for a towel. His reply was that the hotel had instructed him to inform guests to bring their room towels. This seemed very odd to me as I saw other patrons having pool towels. Anyway I proceeded to have a swim and I could not dry myself as I had no towel and I had to go to the room all wet. With the cold wind blowing I could have got pneumonia as well but thankfully that didn't happen. Later on I called the reception to clarify this and they said that the pool attendant should have given me towels and that he had given me false information. In any case I do hope the hotel takes this experience as a learning and inform their pool attendants as to not to refuse to give patrons pool towels. Finally I would like to say that the hotel did allow us to have a late check out in order to compensate for the delayed check in. Overall I would say that I would come back to Heritance Ahungalla due to the friendly and polite staff and the good food. However I hope that I will not face the unpleasent expeirnces I mentioned above, the next time I visit..

The food at this hotel is beyond words, it really is amazing. Compliments to the great chefs, Dimuthu Kumarasinghe and junior chef Dayananda. The chefs have recently won awards and we can totally agree that these awards are very well deserved. The hotel restaurant service is excellent and special thanks go to Mr Gamini and Thushara. Special thanks also go to Chamith and Raju the 2 Animation staff who entertained us with a variety of sports and activities for our children. Chamith and Raju are an asset to this hotel, they are both hard working with great personalities. The rooms we have had have always been super clean and spacious.

"We travelled to this hotel with Kuoni travel under the idea that it was a 5* luxury hotel. This hotel had all the potential of a good 4* hotel. The beech was amazing the staff were amazing, however there always seemed to be something missing and not quality about the hotel. We stayed at this hotel for 7 nights having travelled around the island for 4-5 days. The poolside service was very good with staff being extremely friendly and chatty. The animator was also a healthy addition to the hotel encouraging water polo and other activates throughout the day. The pool bar offered a nice little lunchtime snack menu however every meal was with French fries and wasn’t the best quality. We recommend sprite as it was half the price of coke or diet coke. The sprite was around 70p and coke was £1.50 for a can. There was also a service charge on each bill so there was no need for tipping and carrying cash as it could all be charged to the room The evening food in the main restaurant under a set menu was very average and was trying to be to clever for its own good. Not much variety if you were a fussy eater and didn’t like fish. The al a carte restaurant (or coffee shop) offered a welcome opportunity to get a square meal. This was available with a 10% discount to half and full board customers. when the hotel got busy at the weekend however the restaurant came alive with a huge Mexican and bbq buffet on the Friday and Saturday nights. The breakfasts were also very good with every possible breakfast such as omelettes and waffles. However, when the weekend did arrive the hotel filled with hundreds of locals. This wasnt a problem until the quiet pool became a holiday at butlans with kids screaming and weeing into the pool. The locals were then extremely rude to the friendly staff making the stay extremely uncomfortable as you had to witness this behaviour. The staff were being shouted at and fingers clicked at with no manners. It was clear that the other guests felt the same through conversations in the lobby. The evening buffet at the weekend although it had good food resembled a school canteen. At 9 oclock families were bringing there young screaming children to dinner. Those children who were not dead on there feet at this time were runing around bumping in to the staff and other guests. This un civilised behaviour caused some couples to leave in disgust. The room was very good although we were continually being pested by staff asking if the room was ok. Also the wiring of the room was questionable with switches for different lights being in the wrong place. The beech was a no go area also as you were trying to have a romantic walk along the beech and were surrounded by peopel trying to sell you trips and clothing. Even when you were trying to sun bathe there was a constant noise coming from the beech of people trying to grab your attention. As a result of this I would not recommend this hotel to anyone I liked.

"We visited Heritence Ahungalle for 2 nights in mid-April 2009. This was our second trip to the property having visited 5 years ago on our last trip to SL. Booked directly through the hotel website after comparing other similar properties such as Taj Exotica Bentota, The Fortress, Galle Fort Hotel and Eden Resort. Chose the Heritence given we had a wonderful stay 5 years ago. I wrote to the hotel inquiring about rates and was promised a free upgrade to a luxury room given that I was a returning guest. The hotel also stated that the property has been completely refurbished hence the drastic increase in price. When I got to the Heritence, I was told I would be given a deluxe room (the most basic room). I advised that I was promised a free upgrade to which I was told that they cannot honour this promise. They then advised that I could have an upgrade to a luxury room for an additional cost of Rs. 10,000 (US$86) per night. Given the higher cost I declined the upgrade and was quite disappointed. I had also requested a cot for my infant son when the booking was made. When I got to the hotel I was told that all the cots were in use. I complained to the General Manager who promised to look into it and get back to me, which he never did. We could not notice the refurbishments made to the property. The room we had looked very similar to the room we had five years ago as did the common areas. The property itself is beautifully maintained and is set on a stunning section of beach in SL. The main infinity pool and lobby area are very beautiful. The food is exceptional with a wide variety of choice all of which are of a very high level of quality. We visited this hotel during the Sri Lankan New Year and the hotel was full of local guests. We were blown away by the property and service on our last visit and were disappointed in the level of service during this trip (the GM has changed once during the past 5 years).

"Years ago this was probably a very grand hotel, however the grandeur has faded. The location & facilities appear very good, however the devil is in the detail and the lack of cleanliness makes the whole place feel grubby. I have stayed at numerous 5 star hotels around the world and have seen how standards vary in each continent. So using a European standard I would only rate this 3 star, which might meet some guests expectations. The staff are very friendly and energetic as we have experienced in all seven hotels during our two week Secrete Escapes tour.

"We stayed beginning of August for 3 nights in the Junior Suite in Heritance Ahungalla. In general, the rooms are clean, the swimming pool is nice, especially for kids and also the beach is great. Unfortunately, like most 5-star hotels in Sri Lanka, also this one lacked essential things like a proper finishing in the room (the bathroom was a desaster, I cut myself several times at the glass door there), a very small TV only etc. The food was good quality, thoug a little expensive, but because we liked it we only ate at the hotel. The breakfast had a wide selection, and there was a big variety at the dinner buffetts, for example ""seafood grill night"" etc. The service was very poor, anything you wanted to do or to get took ages and did not work properly. On one saturday night there was a wedding with extremely loud music next to the second pool (where all the suites are localed; it was like a disco), and with still going on after 11 o´clock and the kids not being able to sleep I complained several times without success. It went on until 3 in the morning, which literally destroyed our next day and is something no 5-star hotel should accept. Many guests complained, but the management rather preferred to cash in the money for the ceremony instead of satisfiying their guests. Nevertheless we had altogether a good time, the animateurs at the hotel were dedicated and we had a lot of fun with waterpolo and beach volleyball. One last note: as generally in Sri Lankan 5 star hotels, they overprice taxis etc. by 300 to 400%. Just go out of the hotel and rent a taxi or tuc-tuc there, as next to the savings the locals know all the places to go.",negative,we stayed beginning of august for night in the junior suite in heritance ahungalla in general the room are clean the swimming pool is nice especially for kid and also the beach is great unfortunately like most star hotel in sri lanka also this one lacked essential thing like a proper finishing in the room the bathroom wa a desaster i cut myself several time at the glass door there a very small tv only etc the food wa good quality thoug a little expensive but because we liked it we only ate at the hotel the breakfast had a wide selection and there wa a big variety at the dinner buffetts for example seafood grill night etc the service wa very poor anything you wanted to do or to get took age and did not work properly on one saturday night there wa a wedding with extremely loud music next to the second pool where all the suite are localed it wa like a disco and with still going on after oclock and the kid not being able to sleep i complained several time without success it went on until in the morning which literally destroyed our next day and is something no star hotel should accept many guest complained but the management rather preferred to cash in the money for the ceremony instead of satisfiying their guest nevertheless we had altogether a good time the animateurs at the hotel were dedicated and we had a lot of fun with waterpolo and beach volleyball one last note a generally in sri lankan star hotel they overprice taxi etc by to just go out of the hotel and rent a taxi or tuctuc there a next to the saving the local know all the place to go,1656,303,4.468646864686469,2,0.7479,0.1,0.076,0.824,0.09261574074074073,0.4456018518518518

"Disappointing Dining Experience at Ahungalla Heritance I had high expectations when visiting Ahungalla Heritance (part of the Aitken Spence chain), but the food quality was a major disappointment. The lunch buffet was underwhelming, with most dishes lacking salt and flavor. The fried rice, made with samba rice, was a poor choice and didn’t complement the rest of the dishes at all. Tea-time snacks were no better—minimal variety and nothing appetizing or memorable. We even raised our concerns with the chefs, but unfortunately, there was no noticeable improvement.

"I planned a day out two weeks ago and requested details from the Hotel. I got the confirmation on 10 Feb with the reservation number.

When We went to the hotel, the front office said they could not give us a room since hotel is fully occupied and they give the rooms for the day use on availability basis(not informed at the time of booking).

A hotel that has an impeccable service and warmth about it. From the time you enter to the time you leave the staff will make you feel so at home. Filled with smiles and excellent service 24/7. A wonderful atmosphere with an infinity pool to die for. However i would like to give some constuctive feedback to the hotel management with regard to food. As a five star resort i expected the food on weekdays to be what i would say awesome. But i was disappointed to see the buffet was average. It didnt make me say wow and the dishes were predictable each time i came to the buffet as i stayed 3 nights. I was surprised to hear the hotel has an award winning chef. However it did not reflect so with the cuisine. The silver food containers were very hard to open and close. The buffet should be more colorful and the dessert needs to have variety as i have experienced in other five star hotels in sri lanka. The hotel didnt have a tea/coffee buffet for the evening tea. (As advised by the staff when inquired). Other hotels provide these services for full board guests. The tea in the room is not that pleasant due to the creamer tasting weird with tea. So they need to have a tea corner as well. Next time i return to the hotel i wish see this as a five star hotel to its fullest and not only to the star count.

"I visited Heritance Ahungalla first time 16 years ago and again 15 years ago (when it was still operated under the name Triton), so I was very excited to go back to the hotel to see if it still carried that adventurous atmosphere that it did 16 years ago. I was also vevry excited to see how they had renovated the hotel after the horrible tsunami that destroyed much of the hotel about 10 years ago. I remembered the hotel as a luxurious hotel with a very high standard both in the restaurant and in the small bars around the area where you could buy from a large snack menu. Many of these places were closed now to my disappointment. The hotel of course more or less looked the same and the beautiful architecture of Geoffrey Bawa - Sri Lankas world renowned architect - was of course still stunning. I should say that my previous visits was during the peak season in february where the weather on that part of the island is fantastic. This time I visited in october and we experienced several hours of heavy rain on several of the days we stayed there, and of course that adds to the experience and the atmosphere as they had to keep huge plastic curtains down at all times to keep the water from running into the reception area and the bar area. The hallways was flooded due to the heavy rain and the open design of the hotel so they had to keep staff constantly mopping up water and that was of course no fault of theirs. That's just how it is during this season. But something seemed changed. The hotel seemed to have lost that exclusivity that set it apart from other hotels in Ahugalla/Bentota region.15 years ago there were a wonderful atmosphere in the evenings with jazz band and dancing in the lounge next to the reception and pool area. This time around that was gone - much to our dismay. We also remembered that every afternoon there was a very nice complimentary afternoon tea with buttercake and scones that you could enjoy just next to the large pool but when we asked if they still had it noone even seemed to remember that they had it 15 years ago. We stayed in one of the huge suites with several rooms a seperate living room two bathrooms, a huge balcony overloooking the residents pool with a view of the ocean behind the row of palm trees along the coast line. I don't know if some of the changes to the design and decor was due to the tsunami 10 years ago (after I visited the last time), but I remembered the beautiful residents pool (the other pool that are closed to anyone but guests in the suites and rooms in the fine wing with ocean view, and it was originally made with the most beautiful dark blue tiles that made it one of the most beautiful pools I had ever seen. This time the tiles have been removed and the pool was just an ordinary pool with a normal lightblue surface on the sides and bottom and not made from tiles anymore, just like so many ordinary pools you see all over Sri Lanka. That was sad - I thought. I may have needed refurbishment or renovation but they should have stayed true to the original design with the beautiful dark blue tiles when repairing the pool instead of the cheaper solution, as this did something to make the place stand out in a way that it now doesn't anymore. They also had a wonderful original boat like the ones used by the original population in Sri Lanka that was a trademark of Triton (as it was once called) but they had done little to keep it maintained, so it had obviously deteriorated over the last decade so they hadn't saved it (unless of course it was taken by the tsunami ten years ago). To me it was just a little sad to se that on the patio where it was once standing proud in the middle of the large pool was now just an empty plate with nothing to decorate the otherwise elegant pool area around the public pool and bar area. Another thing that added to the impression they had lowered the standard since we last visited 15 years ago was the many families with screaming children running around the pool. 15 years ago there was a much more tranquil and serene atmosphere with adult guiests with a certain sense of etiquette, which includes preventing your children from running around the other quests at the pool and adressing strangers asking all sorts of questions instead of staying near their parents as they are supposed to when using the residents pool. What had since we last visited become a sad but necessary precaution was a several meters high fence between the hotel grounds and the beach where only a small opening heavily guarded by two guards at all times (day and night) was the only passage to the beach. In the old days one could just stroll down through the line of shady palm trees and reach the beach from anywhere along the hotel grounds. But it was obviously a necessary precaution as we could see that many more touts and beggars and people selling all sorts of ridiculous junk and overpriced sarons, were all over the beach. It even seemed to us as if some of these local hustlers had some corrupt arrangement with some of the guards as they sometimes happened to be inside the fence (which means they have passed the guards unattended), and even when guards saw them on hotel grounds contacting the guests, they did absolutely nothing or very little to stop them from intimidating the guests and/or even excort them from the grounds, which would of course be their duty. One of the nights I stood in the dark on my balcony outside our suite and I noticed a visibly drunk guard who could hardly wallk in a straight line talking a little with himself while he suddenly stopped near the tennis court and fumbled with his trouser until he mannaged to unzip his pants in the middle of the lawn and urinate. That latter I could even live with - I'm no prude - had he just walked behind a tree and taken care of business, but I didn't find the fact that he was visibly drunk very reassuring. The folloing nights I stayed for an hour on my balcony to see if the guard from the night before would return, would return, but much to my surprise I saw something very strange occur. One of the guards (not the same as the drunk guard from yesterday) suddenly turned on his torch and he waved it up and down and from side to sight while pointing it in the direction towards the edge of the hotel grounds. Shortly thereafter I saw two locals walking past the tennis courts and sitting just below my balcony between the building/wing and the tennis court. They couldn't see me as I kept the balcony lights off as well as the lights in the livingroom so I was hidden in the dark. I looked in astonishment as these very suspicious looking local people arrived and they opened small packages and presented them on the top of low walll surrounding the terrace belonging to the suite just below ours and the guards looked at the ""goods"" in the beam of their flashlight at what looked like small packages of either pot or very small portions of khat to me (I've only seen khat but nevver tried it so it could be something else, but I know that khat is very poular if you have a job where it's hard to stay awake and it's popular amongst lorry drivers etc. so I could imagine that a boring night shift would also tempt someone to use khat to keep from falling asleep as it is a mild energy booster that make that kan keep you awake and alert) and khat is actually not amongst forbidden substances in all countries (at least not in Europe), so the use of khat may even be legal in Sri Lanka, that I don't know. Well, that aside, the guards clearly counted and exchanged money for these ""goods"" in the dim light from their torch. Suddenly one of the guards heard me making a noise as I was taking a step back and he pointed the torch directly at my face and for a short while I was blinded, and they saw me on the balcony, so he turned off the torch and they exchanged a few hasty words with the locals who then wrapped up the rest of their goods and ran away along the tennis court and disappeared in the dark. This was in no way frightening or intimidating, but it just seemed like something that wouldn't have happened at the classy and stylish Triton of the old days, and it only contributed to the vague feeling that the standard of the hotel was not quite the same as it was 15 years ago. From the experiences above one would have thought that it was a horrible experience, so why do I give it four stars after all? Because they still provide many of the things they provided in the old days. We always live in large suites when we travel, so I have a large backlog of experiences to use as comparison, and I must say that the suite was wonderful. It was clean and beautifully furnished and the large balcony streched all the way around the suite and had access doors from all rooms in the suite. I will also like to give the place the benefit of the doubt, because many things were closed - and that might be because it is the low season in october, so my final judgment should not be made until I've tried the place again in the high season between medio january until medio march where the weather in the southwest part of the coast line of Sri Lanka has the most beautiful weather. We also dined at the a la carte restaurant (not the large dining hall, but Restaurant Mustard at the terrace on the left side of the reception area just after the reception desk around the corner). The food was delicious, the service was perfect, and the setting was cozy with a dimly lit area and a very romantic atmosphere. So taht was truly perfect. The in-room dining (room service) was also very good and arrived quickly. The breakfast was wonderful and came on time every morning exactly at the time we've put on the breakfast list to hang on the door before going to sleep. The staff couldn't do a better job. They were quick, courteous, smiling, polite and they didn't hover at any time or made certain trick to earn extra tips (such as coming two persons to a one man job, or staying in the room and keep asking if everything is to our satisfaction, etc. - you know the drill). But none from the staff we met did that at any time. Of course my wife and I both agree on giving a generous tip at no less than 20% of the bill every time something is served, so we allso made it easy for the staff not to hover, and that should perhaps be taken into consideration, but we also find that people in Sri Lanka live on extremely low wages, and compared to the prices in Denmark where we live, even an additional 20% still makes for a very cheap price for people living in Europe, Australia and North America, so i cost us so little but means so much to them, so there is no need to be a miserly cheapskate. If you can afford an expensive plane ticket and to stay in a somewhat pricey hotel like this you probably can also survive giving 500-1000 Rps ($3-$6 USD) more when tipping the waiter, room boy, luggage carriers, drivers, etc. It takes so little and being generous when tipping often comes back a thousand fold throughout your stay when you are being served by the grateful, hard working, staff at the hotel, trying to accomodate even your most extravagant wishes and habits.(That's just my personal opinion on this subject, and each to their own, of course). I believe all rooms are non-smoking but most rooms are with a balcony (or a terrace if at ground level) so this is a comfortable hotel for smokers.",negative,i visited heritance ahungalla first time

"Room was average considering we had told them it was our honeymoon. Food was not up to par when comparing with other hotels in Sri Lanka until we spoke to one of the chefs who made us a traditional Sri Lankan curry and brought it to our table. Think they try to cater for far too many people instead of sticking to traditional dishes. We were told that it would be good for snorkelling but the sea is too rough all year round. Better snorkelling a few miles down the coast. Staff were useless at bringing drinks. Could take an awful long time waiting. We got bored with the bar and mundane entertainment and walked along the beach to a ramshackle hut called The Sunset Bar where we were given a warm welcome by the locals who run this place.

"I am writing this over a cup of coffee from the hotel. I have visited this hotel from the days it was triton and this officially concludes my 8th visit to this place (yes thats right !) And i am not joking ! Why so many times well two things always bring us back , one is the food and next is the service and fllexibilty. So this makes it my first visit for this year and believe or not i m due there in september as well. Over the years this hotel was able keep up as one of the trendiest in the vicinity however now it seems to lack behind. The food was once heavenly but now let me simply say "" not as heavenly"" . We were always amazed by the weekend dinner barbecue but this time it was highly dissapointimg and disorganised. We always loved the jumbo prawns and lobster (cray fish) that they always did have . but this time the stock seemed old and frozen . Worst of all the buffet spread never seemed to be re filled . Todays breakfast , i had to tell more than 3 jr chefs to re fill the bacon and it took them 20 mins. So yeah alot of negatives seemed to be observed by our group of friends who have just like me been patriots of this establishement. Rooms seemed to have changed very little. Some rooms seemed to be well stock with all the essentials some rooms seemed to lack a few things e.g bottle openers tea /cofee refills and glasses . However for a person visiting for the first time this perception can definitely differ . This was written with a lot of dissapointment and heart break hope the management will be able to revive this place before it becomes uncontrollable ( not that it is bad ) . Ps one thing that has never ever changed is the friendly staff so kudos for that. Love how pleasant everybody is !

"We stayed here for a few nights in August 2010 as part of a one month trip. I was very excited about staying here as it was designed by one of my favourite architects, Geoffrey Bawa. However, it was a little bit of a let down on a whole. On arrival the hotel is lovely. You drive through some large gates and up to the open reception area where you immediately notice the infinity pool which looks great. All the staff are very smiley but unfortunately the front desk staff don't really know what they are doing. There was a lot of commotion and we did not get checked in for an hour. Some of our friends did not get checked in for 2 hours. Not what you want after a long journey! First impressions of our room were ok. They are clean but nothing special. We were promised a spectular suite as we were there for a special occassion but we were just given a standard deluxe room which was disappointing. We eventually got our suite on our last night but the only difference was a bit more space and a bath so not really worth the extra money in my opinion. We spent a lot time around the infinity pool which is very clean and the pool boys are great. They provide water aerobics every morning and organise water volleyball straight after so it's a bit lively around that pool up unti lunchtime. There is another pool but we didn't use it. If you like your exercise there is also a small gym which is ok. It's small and basic but has the essentials. You can also go for a run along the beach but as with almost every beach in Sri Lanka be prepared to get hassled by the beach boys/women. One guy came for a run with me whilst trying to sell a tour which I thought was very amusing. Unfortunately I could not give him any business! The food here is great. There is a huge variety on offer and you won't be disappointed. However, if you order snack food be prepared to wait or for the staff to get your order wrong. This seemed to be the norm from our experience and speaking to other guests. The same goes for ordering drinks. They are super slow. You can quite often see your cold drink getting warm on the bar whilst the waiters have a chat. People were constantly chasing up the waiters or walking up to collect their own drinks. The staff, with a few exceptions, seemed to be the main problem at this hotel. They are all very friendly but even the simple things seemed to be an effort. Luckily we have a lot of patience so we found it funny but it was obvious some couples and groups there were getting very frustrated. We stayed at several other hotels in Sri Lanka and the staff were a lot more on the ball. Even when we checked out it became chaos. Lot's of confusion, incorrect bills and in one case it took nearly 1.5 hours! It was a group of 6 but still, not acceptable. We took 30mins and there was only 2 of us. To sum up, this hotel is nice. It has character but it is certainly not 5 star. The rooms and staff could be so much better. My plus points would be the infinty pool and the food. Everthing else could do with improvements. I would recommend this hotel but on the basis don't go there expecting the ultimate paradise. It's good but there is better in Sri Lanka. It's pretty good value for money but needs some attention. 7.5/10 overall.",neutral,we stayed here for a few night in august a part of a one month trip i wa very excited about staying here a it wa designed by one of my favourite architect geoffrey bawa however it wa a little bit of a let down on a whole on arrival the hotel is lovely you drive through some large gate and up to the open reception area where you immediately notice the infinity pool which look great all the staff are very smiley but unfortunately the front desk staff dont really know what they are doing there wa a lot of commotion and we did not get checked in for an hour some of our friend did not get checked in for hour not what you want after a long journey first impression of our room were ok they are clean but nothing special we were promised a spectular suite a we were there for a special occassion but we were just given a standard deluxe room which wa disappointing we eventually got our suite on our last night but the only difference wa a bit more space and a bath so not really worth the extra money in my opinion we spent a lot time around the infinity pool which is very clean and the pool boy are great they provide water aerobics every morning and organise water volleyball straight after so it a bit lively around that pool up unti lunchtime there is another pool but we didnt use it if you like your exercise there is also a small gym which is ok it small and basic but ha the essential you can also go for a run along the beach but a with almost every beach in sri lanka be prepared to get hassled by the beach boyswomen one guy came for a run with me whilst trying to sell a tour which i thought wa very amusing unfortunately i could not give him any business the food here is great there is a huge variety on offer and you wont be disappointed however if you order snack food be prepared to wait or for the staff to get your order wrong this seemed to be the norm from our experience and speaking to other guest the same go for ordering drink they are super slow you can quite often see your cold drink getting warm on the bar whilst the waiter have a chat people were constantly chasing up the waiter or walking up to collect their own drink the staff with a few exception seemed to be the main problem at this hotel they are all very friendly but even the simple thing seemed to be an effort luckily we have a lot of patience so we found it funny but it wa obvious some couple and group there were getting very frustrated we stayed at several other hotel in sri lanka and the staff were a lot more on the ball even when we checked out it became chaos lot of confusion incorrect bill and in one case it took nearly hour it wa a group of but still not acceptable we took min and there wa only of u to sum up this hotel is nice it ha character but it is certainly not star the room and staff could be so much better my plus point would be the infinty pool and the food everthing else could do with improvement i would recommend this hotel but on the basis dont go there expecting the ultimate paradise it good but there is better in sri lanka it pretty good value for money but need some attention overall,3256,622,4.236334405144695,3,0.9981,0.172,0.056,0.773,0.13484370871694815,0.5436697965571204

They have pool tables, a library, carton board etc. Plan to do nothing but eat , swim, vegetate and chill. Take a stroll on the beautiful beach, play beach volleyball.

"We were only here one night and arrived mid afternoon, so we were not able to get a very comprehensive view of the property. Check in procedure was very slow, albeit they do bring you a drink and snacks and invite you to sit………….and sit……….…..and sit…………..and just when I was about to get up and enquire what was taking so long, they finally invited us to go to our room. There WERE a few people who arrived at once, but it really did take some considerable time, for reasons not clear to me Check out was also somewhat slow, and then getting summoned to an office behind reception makes you wonder what is going on NOW ? Has my card been declined, my visa an irregularity, am I wanted for something ? Turns out it’s just the cashiers office ! So why not just accept payment at the front desk like every other hotel in the world ? Room was fairly large, comfortable, and of a good standard, with everything one expects from a resort hotel. I particularly liked the sliding shutters, as opposed to curtains. Cesar Ritz said about an hotel needing 3 things - “position, position and position” and this property certainly has position ! Located right on the wide sandy clean beach, (not sure if one can swim from it) warm infinity pool reaching towards the sea. Palm trees, lawns, shady trees around the pool area – it’s the epitome of a beach resort hotel ! It’s a fairly large property too. The standard tourist trap shops selling souvenirs, but I suppose that’s to be expected ! The dinner buffet was of a good standard, and it was very pleasant to be seated in the warm night outside under the palms, on a lawn adjacent the beach, with lanterns for lighting – all very Polynesian Island stuff ! Food was of a good standard, though I found the drinks service a little slow, and slow to follow up. Yes, they were busy with a lot of people, but I often have cause to question whether that is in fact an excuse or not ? In general it’s often about having sufficient and well trained staff, and quite often just about general organization. On the one hand the hotel has everything you would expect of a luxury beach resort hotel, and there is nothing to complain about as such, but for me there was just something slightly missing - it was all TOO standard luxury beach resort, like many others I have stayed in, and no real “wow” factor as such. I suppose it’s difficult to be a “different” beach resort, and perhaps I just stay in too many hotels, but these beach resorts all tend to have the same formula and once one has stayed in a few, they all sort of blend together in your mind – nothing truly memorable ! I had recurring thoughts of Monty Python’s “Package Tour Complaint” skit – go look it up if you aren’t familiar with it ! We would actually like to go back some time and spend a bit longer, as lazing around the pool with a drink was just what we needed at the end of a busy 3 week trip to India and Sri Lanka. In the end though we had a pleasant stay, and no real issues, and I therefore recommend it as a good place to spend a few days and relax !",neutral,we were only here one night and arrived mid afternoon so we were not able to get a very comprehensive view of the property check in procedure wa very slow albeit they do bring you a drink and snack and invite you to sitand sitand sitand just when i wa about to get up and enquire what wa taking so long they finally invited u to go to our room there were a few people who arrived at once but it really did take some considerable time for reason not clear to me check out wa also somewhat slow and then getting summoned to an office behind reception make you wonder what is going on now ha my card been declined my visa an irregularity am i wanted for something turn out it just the cashier office so why not just accept payment at the front desk like every other hotel in the world room wa fairly large comfortable and of a good standard with everything one expects from a resort hotel i particularly liked the sliding shutter a opposed to curtain cesar ritz said about an hotel needing thing position position and position and this property certainly ha position located right on the wide sandy clean beach not sure if one can swim from it warm infinity pool reaching towards the sea palm tree lawn shady tree around the pool area it the epitome of a beach resort hotel it a fairly large property too the standard tourist trap shop selling souvenir but i suppose thats to be expected the dinner buffet wa of a good standard and it wa very pleasant to be seated in the warm night outside under the palm on a lawn adjacent the beach with lantern for lighting all very polynesian island stuff food wa of a good standard though i found the drink service a little slow and slow to follow up yes they were busy with a lot of people but i often have cause to question whether that is in fact an excuse or not in general it often about having sufficient and well trained staff and quite often just about general organization on the one hand the hotel ha everything you would expect of a luxury beach resort hotel and there is nothing to complain about a such but for me there wa just something slightly missing it wa all too standard luxury beach resort like many others i have stayed in and no real wow factor a such i suppose it difficult to be a different beach resort and perhaps i just stay in too many hotel but these beach resort all tend to have the same formula and once one ha stayed in a few they all sort of blend together in your mind nothing truly memorable i had recurring thought of monty python package tour complaint skit go look it up if you arent familiar with it we would actually like to go back some time and spend a bit longer a lazing around the pool with a drink wa just what we needed at the end of a busy week trip to india and sri lanka in the end though we had a pleasant stay and no real issue and i therefore recommend it a a good place to spend a few day and relax,3059,579,4.284974093264249,3,0.9957,0.127,0.039,0.834,0.09393681318681318,0.44061294261294276

"At the entrance to the hotel there was a big advertising board claiming to have the best culinary team in the island, since another tourist recommended the food here we booked in for lunch as a special treat. It was a buffet priced at over £27 per couple which is quite expensive compared to normal Sri Lankan standards, considering all the hype we were expecting a grand lunch to remember. We were tempted by the grilled seafood skewers as a starter and this was the beginning of the worst meal in Sri Lanka ever. We could not eat them they were stale and tough as old boots. I decided to go for the main course and on the way noticed to my horror the cause of the awful starters the chef was taking out old cooked seafood skewers from a container and putting them back on the hot grill. The main course did not impress one bit the meat curry was stale and very dry, the vegetables were overcooked. The desserts were awful and the only good thing served here was what they did not prepare themselves"" the curd & honey"". During our meal we requested to see the chef to make a complaint regarding this terrible food. Finally a gentleman appeared at our table who was unable to give us any satisfactory explanation. We ordered coffee and guess what it was stale and lukewarm. By then we were fuming and demanded to see the manager who was very apologetic and requested us to come back that evening for a meal on him, how kind. He even charged us in full for the worst meal we had in Sri Lanka. Do you think we went back that evening for another repeat performance on the house, ""Hell no"".

"This is a lovely hotel in many ways but it isn't quite good enough to get a ""very good"". It seemed very expensive for what one got but that may be because we booked a suite directly with the hotel. I suspect many of the hotel guests had booked via tour operators and got a considerably better deal than we got. We were shocked by the average age of the guests which must have been 60+. Don't come here expecting a wild or exciting time! The setting is lovely and the beach is good. The waves are wonderful to play in but they are very strong and only for confident swimmers. The food was of a high quality and reasonably priced although breakfast was a little disappointing. Staff were well meaning but often inept. I once asked for bread 5 times before we got any. We could see the bread baskets in the restaurant ready to be given to diners but the waiters just didn't seem able to serve us (there was only one other table dining in the restaurant so the waiters were not rushed off their feet). We also asked for the bill only to be ignored for 15 minutes (despite being the only people in the restaurant by then). When we asked again, we were met with a blank look and a lack of comprehension. In the end, we said we were going to our room and asked if they could send the bill to us there? The bill never arrived although we were charged for the meal so someone managed to sort things out. At breakfast, we wanted to sit outside as the restaurant was very gloomy. There was only one umbrella between about 20 tables so we would sit in the shade which sometimes necessitated moving the table a little or turning it so we weren't in the sun. Quite often, the staff would then move the table back whilst we were serving ourselves at the buffet. We would then move it again. Also, I asked the chef making omelettes if I could have poached eggs and he had no idea what they were. Fortunately, another chef did and went and organised them for me in the kitchen (they were cooked perfectly). Having said all of that, the staff were lovely and wanted to please. The Valentine's dinner was great. It had the perfect level of cheesy entertainment (the dancers were hamming it up brilliantly), the food was very good and the staff couldn't do enough to please. The beds are very uncomfortable so do consider that if bed comfort is important to you. It was like sleeping on wooden boards.

"We visited Heritance Ahungalla recently and observed some pros and cons that might be useful to point out. Pros. 1. As the room was booked as a part of our anniversary, we were given the most spacious room of the category and really loved every bit of it. It was cozy and relaxing. Our favorite part was how it seemed to be a sort of a separate building to the main hotel and opened up to the jacuzzi and resident green pool. 2. The hotel in general was very relaxing and spacious and never felt like it was crowded. well probably because it wasnt! but either way even if there was a heavy crowd it felt like you had your own space. Cons. 1. TV - Ofcourse you dont come on a holiday to watch TV BUT it would be great to have a few good options. The cable tv had very few channels excluding some of the most entertaining movie and tv show channels which I thought was a bit of a bummer. 2. The food was not great and not bad. Average I must say. We expected a large spread but it seemed that since it was off peak season and less crowd also because it was a weekday, there was very little variety and thereby ""threw a dagger"" to our expectations.

Room was well appointed and amenities as listed on hotel website. Eventhough bathroom was good size, the raised up jacuzzi tub with an overhead shower was impratical. Literally need to climb in and out of the tub. We didn't experience the award winning cuisine from the buffet dinner. (Extremely salty grilled prawns, burnt BBQ meat. Poor food presentation). Breakfast was a tad better. Our benchmark was the dinner buffet at Heritance Kandalama. That's what we called award winning. We enjoyed the two pools and the wonderful beach right at the hotel doorstep. The service from the staff was excellent.

We had 4 nights here at the end of a tour and it was by far the worst of the hotels we had stayed at. No problem with the room (though our friends managed to get their room booked out whilst they were in it!) but the service on two nights in the Coffee Shop and the Upper Dining was VERY slow.

"This hotel, fronting the beach on a large plot of land, is popular judging from the number of guests when I was there. Some guests had been there more than 20 times over the years. However, I was rather disappointed to see that the hotel is rather run down, unclean from the dust on the floor, some walls looked as if unpainted, the toiletries in the bath-room were just shampoo, bath gel and body lotion topped up in small ceramic bottles which I dislike as they don’t appear to me to be hygienic. Further more, there were in-room slipper and thus makes walking in the room on unpleasant when wet after a shower. I said earlier, this is not a resort. Apart from the pool and restaurant, there were no other fun activities within the hotel for guests. But despite all these, I rather enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere surrounding the place and the friendly services of all staff. Our 3 nights stay there was thus an enjoyable one.

"This hotel is positioned on a wonderful beach. While the hotel is starting to show its age the staff try very hard to look after the guests.

It would be great to be able to be enjoy the beach without the constant attention (unwanted!) of the touts trying to sell cheap and nasty products on the beach.

"Our stay in this hotel was most enjoyable. All staff worked hard to make our holiday enjoyable. Our room was very comfortable with a sea view. The hotel, grounds and pools are well designed, particularly the main pool. The team of pool attendants are the most helpful I have ever encountered in any hotel in the world. I would certainly recommend this hotel however there is one issue I would suggest the hotel management team consider and that relates to noise from the pool activities and the lounge bar. The hotel has two pools - the one in front of reception is the one seen in all their promotional materials and is beautiful. However, it gets very noisy as a result of very loud music associated with activitites in the pool including aqua aerobics. This mirrors the experience of another reviewer jennymartyn. There is a second pool on the property which is not quite as stunningly beautiful but is still a nice pool. However, the noise from the main pool travels and that spoiled our enjoyment on a couple of occaisions. We prefer to listen to the sound of the waves on the beach and the noise of the birds in the trees not head-banging noise from aqua-aerobics and beach based activities.

"We have just returned from a 2 week (all inclusive) stay at the Heritance and had a great time. Our room was a bit tired but I believe is due to be refurbished, some rooms already having been renovated. The hotel is in a good position on a lovely beach – great for a walk and it would take us just over an hour to walk to the far end and back. The sea is a bit rough for swimming in and the red flag was up for our entire stay, however it was good fun in the waves if you don’t go out your depth. There are 2 decent sized swimming pools and we never had any problem getting a sunbed. Being all inclusive, all our meals were taken in the buffet restaurant. However there is an a la carte and a fish restaurant if you fancy a change, although you would have to pay for these and there is no discount. We found there was plenty of variety on the buffet and the food was of an excellent quality with authentic local dishes and of course a wide choice of different curries (green pea/cashew and beetroot/potato were some of our favourites). All the staff were very friendly and efficient. The chap that cleaned our room (319) was excellent and the bed was always beautifully decorated with flowers. Jananjaya in the restaurant was always there to top up our drinks. When you first arrive and walk on the beach or go out the front gate you will be approached by people looking to sell you trips/tuk tuk rides. Whilst it can get a bit annoying they are definitely better value than the tour operator excursions. We had a taxi to the fort at Galle for £30 between the two of us and the driver waited for us, whereas the tour company were charging £55 each for a half day trip to Galle. We also took tuk tuks to Brief garden by Bevis Bawa and the Lunuganga Estate of Geoffrey Bawa, and they were some of the highlights of our trip. There is an ATM about a 10 minute walk up the road. One thing to be aware of at the airport when you leave Sri Lanka is that you cannot take bottled water onto the plane, even if you have purchased it in the departure lounge. Oh and by the way there is a public holiday when there is a full moon and no alcohol can be sold anywhere and is not available at the hotel.",neutral,we have just returned from a week all inclusive stay at the heritance and had a great time our room wa a bit tired but i believe is due to be refurbished some room already having been renovated the hotel is in a good position on a lovely beach great for a walk and it would take u just over an hour to walk to the far end and back the sea is a bit rough for swimming in and the red flag wa up for our entire stay however it wa good fun in the wave if you dont go out your depth there are decent sized swimming pool and we never had any problem getting a sunbed being all inclusive all our meal were taken in the buffet restaurant however there is an a la carte and a fish restaurant if you fancy a change although you would have to pay for these and there is no discount we found there wa plenty of variety on the buffet and the food wa of an excellent quality with authentic local dish and of course a wide choice of different curry green peacashew and beetrootpotato were some of our favourite all the staff were very friendly and efficient the chap that cleaned our room wa excellent and the bed wa always beautifully decorated with flower jananjaya in the restaurant wa always there to top up our drink when you first arrive and walk on the beach or go out the front gate you will be approached by people looking to sell you tripstuk tuk ride whilst it can get a bit annoying they are definitely better value than the tour operator excursion we had a taxi to the fort at galle for between the two of u and the driver waited for u whereas the tour company were charging each for a half day trip to galle we also took tuk tuks to brief garden by bevis bawa and the lunuganga estate of geoffrey bawa and they were some of the highlight of our trip there is an atm about a minute walk up the road one thing to be aware of at the airport when you leave sri lanka is that you can not take bottled water onto the plane even if you have purchased it in the departure lounge oh and by the way there is a public holiday when there is a full moon and no alcohol can be sold anywhere and is not available at the hotel,2189,427,4.128805620608899,6,0.9961,0.141,0.029,0.83,0.23219696969696965,0.5186868686868688

When they finally gave us the room it was not cleaned well and we were told that the family before us had really messed it up and also stayed on way past check out time. Apart from this our stay was good. The room was big and spacious and the beds very comfortable. If the doors were left open a few mosquitoes would get in so its best to keep them shut when going to the pool or beach. The room service was ok. Best to stick to the rice as the burger we ordered was not very good. The fried rice was quite good. The staff are friendly and helpful. The chefs at the live stations in the morning (specially a lady) were very unenthusiastic about serving and overall the service was very poor.

"I checked this hotel at tripadvisor before booking it and expected it to be nice and relaxing at the very least, however, the whole stay (we stayed there for 3 weeks) was a complete and utter disappointment! Looks like Heritance has changed a lot lately and it's surely not a 5* hotel anymore. After an almost 20-hour trip to the hotel, my only wish was to have a shower and lie down, however, we had to spent almost half an hour answering stupid questions about our anniversary, etc. The staff was too talkative and tactless even, several times we had spend almost the entire lunch in their company and nothing could possibly make them leave. All the advantages of this place faded away in comparison with its negative sides. Quite nice design of the room couldn't make up for holes in bedsheets, dirty curtains, breaking conditioning, old towels and other things. The food was really fabulous, however, when the evening food was under a set menu, almost all guest opted for the a la carte restaurant as the set menu was really poor and the meal lasted forever. The atmosphere was quite relaxing most of the time, however, there was no chance to even enter the pool as soon as weekend came and the hotel was fully packed with locals. Some things kept on spoiling our stay on every day basis. The beach area was constantly full of locals, who were trying to sell you a trip or whatever you wanted or didn't wanted. Even by the pool your every single movement was followed by their attempts to draw your attention. If you managed to escape and reach the ocean, several guys were waiting for you to come back.

"We vacationed with friends from 02/12/24 to 02/19/2024. The hotel is super, I don’t know who writes angry reviews. You need to understand that this is Asia. The hotel is very clean, they cleaned and changed towels every day. There are only 2 bars, one is always empty, unfortunately, the second bar always has delicious cocktails and beer (beer is so-so, like lemonade), but whiskey and cola is super. The waiters are very attentive; in general, Sri Lankans themselves are very kind. When it comes to food, you won’t be left hungry; be sure to try the oysters, incredibly tasty. There are many Russians, 70-80 percent, the rest are Europeans, but everyone is very cultured, no one bothers anyone. There was a lot of security; once I was going to the beach to visit friends at night, the security escorted me to make sure I was not alone. The ocean is gentle, the waves are just super, I don’t know who needs a lagoon, the ocean without waves is a lake😁 on excursions: here they are trying to deceive our brother everywhere. Valuables just speak from their heads. We went to Kandy with Kamal, I’ve attached the number.

"Maybe our expectations were different, but we didn’t get what we were hoping for with our three-day stgay at the Heritance Ahungalla. We thought that an all-inclusive resort would be a relaxing base of operations but found that we were pretty much sequestered on the property. We wanted to get out and about during the day or night and the operation and setting did not lend themselves to that – the Heritance wants to capture all of your money during your visit. Rooms were clean and nicely appointed but small. High premiums for everything, from bottled water to laundry to room service to internet. Food options were limited and consistently underwhelming.

"This is definately not a 5 star hotel, it's decor is very shabby, bed linen is off colour, stained and has seen better days.

The same goes for the beach, you cannot get on it in without being harassed as they line the edge of the hotel grounds. Would not recommend booking holidays thru the rep as these are double the price of using the hotel taxi's to take you to the same places. If you are not giving the locals, be it where ever you are, tips for this that and everything then they are very abrupt and can't get rid of you quick enough, especially the rep!

"Was working in Sri Lanka and had the weekend to myself and managed to get a very good rate last minute for a very reasonable price (same as a HIE in uk) however full rate I think would be maybe not so worth it. Please note when I arrived they were doing quite a bit of rennovations (though this was being done discreetly and quietly to minimise effect to guests). However hotel was probably at least 50% empty. Hotel is a Geofrey Bawa Hotel (famous architect) and you can see his style throughout the hotel. Its not the usually glassy inpersonal type hotel that you can sometimes stay in - this hotel does have character for a large hotel. Though I think the hotel could do more to enhance this. Its quite a Large hotel with reasonable facilities. I went for a wander when I first arrived and everytime I turned a corner I seemed to find something new whether it was table tennis, to the table courts to a bars that are nicely spread out. Hotel itself is in lovely bay with some wonderful views. Overall I think it was a lovely stay however not quite as special as I thought it would be from hotel website. LOCATION Its roughtly 1.5 hours drive from Colombo, and probably a good 3 hours drive from airport. If you are suffering after a travelling you maybe want to do a stop over in Negombo near airport or Colombo city. Its slightly away from many of the overcrowded toursit areas like Bentota and this can have good and bad points. ARRIVAL When you arrive at the hotel - you are ushered to sit down and they bring over some refreshments whilst you sign in. It was nicely done - though I think if busy this may take some time, this si kind of usual for Sri lanka so be prepared for this and I take the time to wander a little or orders ome drinks. ROOM Room was well furnished and decorated - I had view of the back Pool and beach. Full AC and Fan. Please note room leads to an open plan corridor (very Geffrey Bawa - but this does mean at night you may get a few mosi's in your room when you open door or use the balacony so get them to spray your room before you go to bed and use the fan(mosi cant land on you if you have fan on) - I carry a can of baygon which you can buy in local shops to kill any mosi that may be hiding at night. Toilet was nicely done - though please note - no bath - which if you have children you may want to check on which rooms have baths. The toiletries were fine - but nothing to write home about - personally I prefer my own. Hairdryer in bathroom was good enough for ladies use. All seemed very clean and nice Wardrobe and draws, and space above draws doubles as suitcase stand. Beds were very comfortable, and sheets and towels all seemed fine and I had no complaints compared to other reviewers. Room had safe in wardrobe which seemed usual good hotel quality. There was a console desk for laptop and stuff. Kettle coffee/tea facilities. There was a very small mini frdge but it had no icebox which is a shame. Also please note alcohol apart from local beer is expensive - I would purchase what you need at duty free. Also in room large media cabinet - I am hoping they will look into flatscreens tv soon! Usual Sri Lankan Satellite available. I would have liked a DVD player. Also is small sofa and coffee table. Room had good lighting and I loved instaed of heavy curtains. they have light muslin nets curtain and then huge sliding panels which makes the room very dark and peaceful. The windows seemed to insulate reasonable well against outside although to be fair it was very quiet in any case. The balcony was usual standard - 2 seats and table. They gave free wifi FACILITIES Not bad for Sri Lankan hotel, but not quite up to a top western hotel. 2 very lovely pools, one with jacuzzi. tennis court (not sure whether in good state), table tennis, fitness room (nobody uses), pool/snooker tables (you pay for this about $1.5) 3 restaurants and quite a few bars, there is a games room and library however I never bothered to check this out. However no shops (its shutdown) jsut a jewerally shop. To get to anywhere you need to take a short drive. There is very lovely Spa with Indonesian ladies brought in specially - my advice - check this out - its lovely! FOOD I never bothered with restaurants - prefering to get room service. My first order a salad was so dissappointing - I had 1 lettuce leaf - I kid you not. However I peservered and everything else that came was lovely, and they even brought me cocktails and extra's to the room. However for half board price its probably better value to just eat the buffet on offer. I did do breakfast and was a good Sri Lankan buffet with plenty of variety from European, German, English, French to Sri Lankan curries. BEACH Beach is lovely - pretty clean when I went and is a very long bay. No packs of dogs and all very pretty. However annoying youths spoiled my walk by myself but the other locals when they heard were so horrified by rude behavious and apologised - which was very sweet. they even offered to accompany me at a distance so I could enjoy my walk without being bothered. SPA Well worth a visit on 1st day to help you get into holiday spirit of relaxation. Not Sri Lankan cheap but reasonable price by western prices. SERVICE It was quiet, however I thought service was very good. nicely balanced although I can see how some reviewers may get annoyed with the overfriendliness of some staff. Bless them they are on the whole very eager to make sure you enjoy yourself and you stay is good. I would rather have this than the rude obnoxious service you can get in the UK. Other points - Ground floor rooms - balcony is open to the grounds. Its perfectly safe - but with very young children this may be either a blessing or an issue. Also the ground floor rooms near the back swimming pool - may get noisy. If this is an issue I would mention it when you book or email hotel before your arrival. BOOKING OUT The bane of all Sri Lankan Hotels and this one is no exception - allow 20 mins at least to book out if its not busy and a lot longer if it is busy. I would suggest get them to organise bill whilst you finish packing up or having breakfast. OVERALL A really lovely hotel but perhaps not quite up to the image suggested on the glossy website (but maybe after rennovations??). However I actually preferred this to the Lighthouse near galle (another Geofrey Bawa hotel) due to service and has a certain something to it. Location is lovely and tranquil when I visited. Would I go back - most definately however 3-4 days would be my limit. Just not enough there yet.",neutral,wa working in sri lanka and had the weekend to myself and managed to get a very good rate last minute for a very reasonable price same a a hie in uk however full

"We came to this hotel for a couple of days of rest and sun at the end of a two week tour of Sri Lanka. I have to admit it was my least favourite hotel. Yes there was lots of opportunity for sunbathing around the pool. The men were very attentive with keeping the grounds immaculate and bringing mattresses and towels. Also the bars were located around the grounds so drink was easy to obtain. But despite this being a hotel designed to blend with nature, I found the stark long corridors austere and unfriendly, and very noisy. In fact they echoed any noise particularly in the early mornings. In the restaurant there were far fewer waiters than previously and those that were in attendance were much less attentive. And the entertainment was a mixed bag. We saw a delightful cultural show followed by a very amateurish fire show. Positives? Lovely large rooms. The quietest air con ever. Great range of food.

"Well having had a long flight and a long drive I may have been slightly over tired but my first impressions of the hotel and the room was disappointment. It does come down to taste but I found the hotel is characterless. Our room was good but without the two extra beds for the children which was irritating as my husband had emailed the hotel directly confirming them but they were set up quickly and our request for table lamps in the lounge rather than overhead lighting met as quickly. The children loved the pools and I absolutely hated breakfast! It was enough to bring tears to your eyes the oppressive dining room the scrum around the breakfast bar seemingly at all times, the awful service. I had so many variations on getting a cup of earl grey they were green tea, warm milk, teabags and nothing else including water or a cup, they ran out of tea bags I supplied my own and then tea arriving 30 minutes later when you're just about to leave. In the land of bountiful fruit why are 3 out of 5 breakfast juices made from concentrate or nearer to cordial? Can they not default to 4 place servings, then if 2 come to breakfast they are happy and if 4 come down they are instantly satisified a win win rather than waiting 10 minutes for cutlery for 2 of the party. Can they not allocate a server to families staying longer than 3 nights thus establishing a rapport. Saying that the service elsewhere was fine. The food ranged from adequate to good. Amal's in Bentota was excellent for sea food and Refresh in Hikkaduwa(45 mins) had an enormous choice and was very good. The location was ok , Galle was an hour drive Bentota about 30 minutes. We did take some trips to Udawlawe 4 hours each way and Sinharaja 3 hours each way. As mentioned in previous reviews the beach is effectively out of bounds if you do not wish to be pursued by the local tour guides and hawkers. It could be a great hotel with adequate staff training to instill a sense of ownership and pride, a rethink of the decor, a complete overhaul of the main dining room practices, some investment in soft furnishings.

"we chose this hotel for 5 days rest on our arrival in Sri Lanka. Whilst the hotel itself is lovely and our room was fantastic - clean, large, great balcony, lovely big clean bathroom - we were disappointed by the aggressive sales tactics of the staff every time we were in the main hotel area. We were constanly being asked if we wanted to try the spa, the fine dining restaurant or the outrageously expensive barbecue on the beach. We found the hotel bar and restaurant to be very over priced as well. This is definitely more of a family hotel so those without children may consider other options. There is a limited amount to do outside the hotel so may be better for people on an all inclusive or at least half board package.

In fact this is the main reason we would return to this hotel. The rooms were fine - we stayed on the 3rd floor and they gave us a nice basket of fruit,biscuits and peanuts to welcome us. I thought dinner was average but nevertheless enjoyable; breakfast was lovely. It is more of a family hotel/ older couple hotel and I think the entertainment is geared to that audience. For the price this hotel is amazing. Another thing worth mentioning is this hotel seems to do a lot for its local community which I think is fantastic - there was an ad for a charity it supports in the lift.

"We had the opportunity to stay for one night. The pool and beach were truly exceptional, providing a delightful experience. The variety offered in all three meals was impressive, with a wide range of flavors that were quite enjoyable. However, I must express my disappointment with the accommodations. The room we were assigned felt quite dated, and the beds were not particularly comfortable. Additionally, the air conditioning unit's controller was malfunctioning, which affected our comfort. The bathroom was notably small, particularly the shower cubicle, making it inconvenient for a comfortable bathing experience. It's worth mentioning that the absence of a hand shower in the bathroom was a drawback. Regrettably, we also found that the staff did not display the same level of friendliness towards locals.

"We recently stayed at the Heritance and I can say that it was an absolute delight. From the moment you arrive it takes your breath away -- the drive up to the front of the hotel brings you to the view through the lobby, out over the pool and to the see beyond. The hotel's refurbishment has been sumptuous -- beautiful furniture, stylish decor and very well appointed rooms. The food was excellent. Every day we'd see the restaurant manager who would talk to us by the pool and tell us what the specials were going to be that evening, and on the one occasion we went to the fine dining restaurant we had the most exquisite food. We were brought two extra complimentary courses and had wonderfully attentive service (although I have to say that a very minor downside here was that I don't think the staff realised that the CD they had put on was a Christmas CD, which wasn't too appropriate in late January, but never mind...)

"I was attending a wedding held on 20th December 2014 and a friend of mine and I had decided to stay at Heritance. Coming from the UK I was keen to stay close to the wedding venue and enjoy the supposed five star luxury that this hotel boasted to offer. My friend a resident of Sri Lanka arranged the accommodation some five months in advance for us to stay from 19 Dec till 21 Dec, using Booking.com. However upon arrival, they didn't have our booking for 19 only 20. Some 45 minutes, emails and phone calls later I was given a room based on half board. The room itself was large and nice. A bit dark in decor but view of sea front was nice. The hotel is large however there is no clear indication of how the rooms are numbered on each floor. There is according to the member of staff showing me to my room a north and South wing again this is not indicated visibly so it's easy to get lost. The entrance of the hotel is stunning however the rest of the hotels falls in comparison. For four hours I was without WIFI, a number of phone calls later a staff member turns up and fiddles with my phone including switching my phone off airplane mode connecting me to my UK service provider and leaving me with a £40.00 data roaming fee whilst still not realising that the Wifi was an issue with the hotel and not my phone. After trying to relocate me to a new room much smaller with a terrible view I eventually head in hands and eyes filled with tears of frustration and tiredness, was placed in a more pleasant room with a bigger balcony that over looked the sea and the wedding venue. The sliding door which acts as a blackout was unable to fully close because the side table was too big. I had to move this in order for the blackout to fully close. The air conditioner controls were broken in all three rooms so I had to use my nails to switch off the air conditioner. The shower cubicle was placed in such a away that you had to get in close the door before turning shower on. The hotel toiletries were poor - the shower gel and shampoo were all placed in bottles that were not sealed and the soap was well rather useless. There were also no small hand towels or towels big enough to dry hair with. All in all two large bath towels and two hand towels. No bath robes either to sit and relax in. A basic I feel for a hotel claiming to be five star. The mini bar of the last room was broken and had never been checked so we found the drinks warm mouldy and in drinkable. The cost of a glass of wine in comparison to the bottle found in the mini bar also made no sense. It was cheaper in the mini bar. The dining room (only one restaurant in this hotel) was dark and dismal. The hot food area was hard to find until further inspection. The food was ok. A very basic selection. Nothing fancy or elaborate. The bar area outside by entrance was far more prettier yet the service was poor. Morning breakfast in the same dining room was a very dark and gloomy affair. The decor and seating was so basic and dark that you just didn't want to eat in there. The only blessing was the guest relations officer Shanika who was so lovely and ever so eager to ensure we were happy that she went out of her way to do everything to make us feel at ease. We were on exit served with a $200.00 a night bill which I had to question over and over again. I am really sad to say that it was really shocked and disappointed by everything I had witnessed at this ""luxury"" hotel and having had a thorough read of what is expected to meet the international standards of a five star hotel - this to me is just a glorified bed and breakfast. Having experienced five star luxury and also other ratings of hotels I think I have had better staying in a cheap bed and breakfast in Brighton for far less the price tag. I can't say I would recommend this hotel to anyone and would recommend those that work hard for their money go look elsewhere.",negative,i wa attending a wedding held on th december and a friend of mine and i had decided to stay at heritance coming from the uk i wa keen to stay close to the wedding venue and enjoy the supposed five star luxury that this hotel boasted to offer my friend a resident of sri lanka arranged the accommodation some five month in advance for u to stay from dec till dec using bookingcom however upon arrival they didnt have our booking for only some minute email and phone call later i wa given a room based on half board the room itself wa large and nice a bit dark in decor but view of sea front wa nice the hotel is large however there is no clear indication of how the room are numbered on each floor there is according to the member of staff showing me to my room a north and south wing again this is not indicated visibly so it easy to get lost the entrance of the hotel is stunning however the rest of the hotel fall in comparison for four hour i wa without wifi a number of phone call later a staff member turn up and fiddle with my phone including switching my phone off airplane mode connecting me to my uk service provider and leaving me with a data roaming fee whilst still not realising that the wifi wa an issue with the hotel and not my phone after trying to relocate me to a new room much smaller with a terrible view i eventually head in hand and eye filled with tear of frustration and tiredness wa placed in a more pleasant room with a bigger balcony that over looked the sea and the wedding venue the sliding door which act a a blackout wa unable to fully close because the side table wa too big i had to move this in order for the blackout to fully close the air conditioner control were broken in all three room so i had to use my nail to switch off the air conditioner the shower cubicle wa placed in such a away that you had to get in close the door before turning shower on the hotel toiletry were poor the shower gel and shampoo were all placed in bottle that were not sealed and the soap wa well rather useless there were also no small hand towel or towel big enough to dry hair with all in all two large bath towel and two hand towel no bath robe either to sit and relax in a basic i feel for a hotel claiming to be five star the mini bar of the last room wa broken and had never been checked so we found the drink warm mouldy and in drinkable the cost of a glass of wine in comparison to the bottle found in the mini bar also made no sense it wa cheaper in the mini bar the dining room only one restaurant in this hotel wa dark and dismal the hot food area wa hard to find until further inspection the food wa ok a very basic selection nothing fancy or elaborate the bar area outside by entrance wa far more prettier yet the service wa poor morning breakfast in the same dining room wa a very dark and gloomy affair the decor and seating wa so basic and dark that you just didnt want to eat in there the only blessing wa the guest relation officer shanika who wa so lovely and ever so eager to ensure we were happy that she went out of her way to do everything to make u feel at ease we were on exit served with a a night bill which i had to question over and over again i am really sad to say that it wa really shocked and disappointed by everything i had witnessed at this luxury hotel and having had a thorough read of what is expected to meet the international standard of a five star hotel this to me is just a glorified bed and breakfast having experienced five star luxury and also other rating of hotel i think i have had better staying in a cheap bed and breakfast in brighton for far less the price tag i cant say i would recommend this hotel to anyone and would recommend those that work hard for their money go look elsewhere,3909,755,4.178807947019868,-2,0.9118,0.097,0.086,0.817,0.04727692705304646,0.5304392001033792
"From most of the reviews here and because of the generally good reputation of Heritance hotels we had high expectations for our stay here. This was the last part of our Sri Lankan trip before returning to Colombo and the plan was to relax and enjoy a luxury hotel along a beautiful beach. The beach was beautiful but the hotel was disappointing. Pros: -Beautiful beach-clean, not crowded. -Decently appointed room with large balcony. -Wifi that worked well. -Lovely reception area and infinity pool. Cons: -Room floor was sandy, bathroom mats with dirt smudges. -Bad housekeeping service. After being out all morning our room still wasn't cleaned - I called and asked to have it done right away while we were at lunch. They finally arrived while we were napping three hours later. -Broken minibar never repaired or replaced, after we requested -Breakfast buffet restaurant -Very strong moldy/mildewy smell permeates. Buffet adequate but not great. Chaotic atmosphere and spotty-to-bad service. -Hall noise (many children in hotel during our stay) -Noise from pool area - music at night, exercise activity in pool mid-morning Altogether there were too many things wrong with this stay.

"This is absolutely not a 5 star resort - not by international or Sri Lankan standards. Everything from the small room to the aged gym and very basic amenities was a disappointment. The food is admittedly excellent but the restaurant staff have absolutely no sense of how to host more than 100 people. On the whole, the staff are friendly but typically clueless. Basic hotel processes such as charging drinks to a room or booking a spa appointment have proved very trying. Their cashier desk is simply a joke - patrons have to go to a little room in the back of reception to make small payments, as if they are in some bizarre 1950s public administration building.

"Now, we have been coming back to this Hotel since it was called Triton because it stood out among typical beach hotels in Sri Lanka and coming here once in a while was treat for our children. It is a quite different now, and not particularly in a good manner. Our last stay at the hotel was on a weekday and was out of season. The property was about half full and a renovation was going on in the main side. At the dining hall, for some odd reason, there were no cloth table napkins and instead, a cheap replacement of paper serviettes. The food served were all so bland and nothing impressive, that's including desserts. I even overheard a couple saying that it was the same for the past few days! Breakfast had in store for us, an averagely spicy Sri Lankan food corner which was quite good. Pools and activity around the pool was enjoyable and the best part of this stay. An interesting underwater Zumba class also took place! The rooms were the same as before, thank goodness, but one thing made me stop my praise. The bidet shower was out of order. There was a surprise at the check out. I made reservation by calling this hotel and made sure that child meal charge was included with the price. (Child stays free in a double room sharing bed but for the meal, they charge about 30USD). In any case, we were asked to pay extra for the child meal because the price mentioned was the Double room rate. It was a mistake done by booking operator and the Hotel said that if we refuse to pay, the balance will have to be deducted from operator's wage. Since we did not want that to happen, we just paid and left. Overall, I think the hotel could have done a little more to repeating guests. I think that the hotel might have gotten complacent, due to the five star rankings people have given them, but as of now we lost loyalty to this hotel and unlikely to recommend others to stay.",negative,now we have been coming back to this hotel since it wa called triton because it stood out among typical beach hotel in sri lanka and coming here once in a while wa treat for our child it is a quite different now and not particularly in a good manner our last stay at the hotel wa on a weekday and wa out of season the property wa about half full and a renovation wa going on in the main side at the dining hall for some odd reason there were no cloth table napkin and instead a cheap replacement of paper serviette the food served were all so bland and nothing impressive thats including dessert i even overheard a couple saying that it wa the same for the past few day breakfast had in store for u an averagely spicy sri lankan food corner which wa quite good pool and activity around the pool wa enjoyable and the best part of this stay an interesting underwater zumba class also took place the room were the same a before thank goodness but one thing made me stop my praise the bidet shower wa out of order there wa a surprise at the check out i made reservation by calling this hotel and made sure that child meal charge wa included with the price child stay free in a double room sharing bed but for the meal they charge about usd in any case we were asked to pay extra for the child meal because the price mentioned wa the double room rate it wa a mistake done by booking operator and the hotel said that if we refuse to pay the balance will have to be deducted from operator wage since we did not want that to happen we just paid and left overall i think the hotel could have done a little more to repeating guest i think that the hotel might have gotten complacent due to the five star ranking people have given them but a of now we lost loyalty to this hotel and unlikely to recommend others to stay,1881,353,4.331444759206799,2,0.9741,0.11,0.058,0.832,0.11445312499999999,0.38324652777777773

"As we pulled up outside the entrance to this hotel we were amazed at the view. We were looking forward to some relaxing days. We were shown to our room which was disappointing. It had a poor view and the shower was in need of some good quality cleaning products, with the grouting all black and the glass door was covered in limescale. We were so unhappy and disappointed (this was the third hotel in the group that we've stayed at on this trip) that we asked to be moved to a different room. This was facilitated but we had to wait almost two hours for the replacement room to be ready. This room had a much better outlook and whilst the grouting was cleaner, there was still the same issue with the shower door. Some good limescale remover used regularly would work wonders. That said, the overall cleanliness of the room was very good. The room cleaning service was always good and the guys couldn't have been more helpful. The pool and gardens are nice and the staff at the pool were very good. On one occasion a man was in difficulty in the pool having wandered out of his depth, and the lifeguard on duty leaped to his aid. A happy ending. Don't be too worried if you see chipmunks and land monitors passing by. Perhaps even the occasional monkey. We found the service at the pool bar to be friendly but quite slow, with some staff, on occasion, preferring to stand and chat together. We ate in the outdoor restaurant twice and found the food to be pretty awful. After those poor experiences we ate in the buffet restaurant. I wish I could be more positive but I can only be honest - the evening meals were not up to the level of that at the previous hotel at which we'd stayed. We found many dishes overcooked and almost cold. At the dessert bar, only half the items were labelled, and if you went to eat after the main rush it felt like we were being given the leftovers. The whole presentation was lacklustre. The staff though, were very nice and friendly and the service good, though some worked harder than others.

"This hotel was a bit of a disappointment, not the five star rating we were expecting. In our opinion this hotel needs to be downgraded to four star. Whilst there was some painting/maintenance work taking place while we were there, the hotel didn’t have that ‘luxurious’ five star feeling about it. Certainly comparing it to a five star rated hotel we stayed in whilst holidaying in Zanzibar 18 month's ago, it was definitely of a different class/standard. The fruit bowl, dressing gowns and slippers were not in our room when we arrived and there was no mention, when we checked in, of them arriving later. The cream rug was filthy (we rolled it up and put it under the bed) and that improved the look of the room immediately! On the plus side, the staff were extremely friendly and helpful and very responsive to our needs. On several occasions we only had one bath towel left instead of two which meant having to call house-keeping. Although immediately we called the second towel would rapidly appear, this isn't the level of service we would expect from a five star resort. The restaurant areas were nice and the food was good. We tended to eat in the coffee shop which also served as a restaurant which did some nice meals, we did eat occasionally in the buffet restaurant. The pool area is nice. The hotel is located on the beach, but most of the time the red flags are flying due to the under currents there. On most days despite the red flag flying people still went into the sea, if you went with caution you were fine, but there were occasions people got into difficulties and the life guard at the hotel had to come to their rescue. We enjoyed watching a wedding take place whilst there. We also had the experience of seeing one of the resident monitor lizards digging up and eating another monitor lizard’s eggs (13 in all!!!). We were lucky enough to see a turtle come ashore and lay her eggs on the beach before going back out to sea – wow what a wonderful experience. We also visited a turtle hatchery up the road, take a tuk tuk (it’s cheaper than a taxi) and if you want to experience putting baby turtles into the sea you need to go at dusk around 6.00 pm (in Feb). Before booking this hotel we were told we could go out of the hotel and that there were lots of eating places in the area, this is not the case. We were told not to go out of the resort at night, so that was also disappointing. Sadly there is no ‘all inclusive’ option here. In summary, this is a nice hotel, situated on a lovely beach, not five star luxury, but a nice four star. We were here celebrating my 50th birthday and wanted a bit of luxury after touring for 8 nights and in retrospect wish we had stayed at either The Jetwing Lighthouse or The Fortress in Galle.",neutral,this hotel wa a bit of a disappointment not the five star rating we were expecting in our opinion this hotel need to be downgraded to four star whilst there wa some paintingmaintenance work taking place while we were there the hotel didnt have that luxurious five star feeling about it certainly comparing it to a five star rated hotel we stayed in whilst holidaying in zanzibar month ago it wa definitely of a different classstandard the fruit bowl dressing gown and slipper were not in our room when we arrived and there wa no mention when we checked in of them arriving later the cream rug wa filthy we rolled it up and put it under the bed and that improved the look of the room immediately on the plus side the staff were extremely friendly and helpful and very responsive to our need on several occasion we only had one bath towel left instead of two which meant having to call housekeeping although immediately we called the second towel would rapidly appear this isnt the level of service we would expect from a five star resort the restaurant area were nice and the food wa good we tended to eat in the coffee shop which also served a a restaurant which did some nice meal we did eat occasionally in the buffet restaurant the pool area is nice the hotel is located on the beach but most of the time the red flag are flying due to the under current there on most day despite the red flag flying people still went into the sea if you went with caution you were fine but there were occasion people got into difficulty and the life guard at the hotel had to come to their rescue we enjoyed watching a wedding take place whilst there we also had the experience of seeing one of the resident monitor lizard digging up and eating another monitor lizard egg in all we were lucky enough to see a turtle come ashore and lay her egg on the beach before going back out to sea wow what a wonderful experience we also visited a turtle hatchery up the road take a tuk tuk it cheaper than a taxi and if you want to experience putting baby turtle into the sea you need to go at dusk around pm in feb before booking this hotel we were told we could go out of the hotel and that there were lot of eating place in the area this is not the case we were told not to go out of the resort at night so that wa also disappointing sadly there is no all inclusive option here in summary this is a nice hotel situated on a lovely beach not five star luxury but a nice four star we were here celebrating my th birthday and wanted a bit of luxury after touring for night and in retrospect wish we had stayed at either the jetwing lighthouse or the fortress in galle,2756,511,4.395303326810176,4,0.994,0.122,0.03,0.847,0.18154085497835495,0.5592352092352092
This is my 2nd time at the hotel. We were allocated a spacious room. The hotel was at full capacity. The F& B managers were very good and helpful. The rooms were clean but I felt the housekeeping service lacked quite a bit. There was a cultural show and many kids activities. On the downside I was a little annoyed when the hotel had left a letter under my door reminding me about our check out for the next day. I had paid in full for both days and I feel such a reminder was not required.

"Stayed in the Heritance Anhungalla for six nights in September. It is a smart stylish hotel designed by Bawa, Sri Lanka's foremost architect. Some may find it a bit stark and white, we loved it. The rooms were large with a lot of character; comfortable beds and a very diligent roomboys. Food in the main restaurant was buffet style with lots of choice and some interesting Sri Lankan dishes. Prices are a bit on the high side, there is a cheaper restaurant but the menu was limited. There are two pools, one is reserved for reidents, they have weekend visitors who can use the other pool. It is quite a large hotel but still got a bit crowded when they had a convention at the weekend. There are fabulous sunsets out to sea. The beach is heavily occupied by traders, the ladies have some good scarves and sarongs at cheap prices, guys want to sell you a boet ride or visit the restaurant down the beach. Some of our party did and found it very good and cheap. The beach boys are very polite, as are all Sri Lankans that we met and if you say you just want to be quiet and don't want to talk they leave you alone. The beach drops sharply into the sea and waves were popwerful so bathing is banned. This is one of the drawbacks of the hotle. The other problem is that there is nowhere to walk outside the hotel, if you venture out of the gate swarms of helpfull people appear! I think it's a great hotel for three or four nights, we got a bit bored after that.",positive,stayed in the heritance anhungalla for six night in september it is a smart stylish hotel designed by bawa sri lankas foremost architect some may find it a bit stark and white we loved it the room were large with a lot of character comfortable bed and a very diligent roomboys food in the main restaurant wa buffet style with lot of choice and some interesting sri lankan dish price are a bit on the high side there is a cheaper restaurant but the menu wa limited there are two pool one is reserved for reidents they have weekend visitor who can use the other pool it is quite a large hotel but still got a bit crowded when they had a convention at the weekend there are fabulous sunset out to sea the beach is heavily occupied by trader the lady have some good scarf and sarong at cheap price guy want to sell you a boet ride or visit the restaurant down the beach some of our party did and found it very good and cheap the beach boy are very polite a are all sri lankans that we met and if you say you just want to be quiet and dont want to talk they leave you alone the beach drop sharply into the sea and wave were popwerful so bathing is banned this is one of the drawback of the hotle the other problem is that there is nowhere to walk outside the hotel if you venture out of the gate swarm of helpfull people appear i think it a great hotel for three or four night we got a bit bored after that,1459,278,4.251798561151079,4,0.9464,0.107,0.058,0.835,0.19919784580498864,0.5363718820861678

"Overall a very good hotel and staff were excellent. Some areas of the hotel were tired but everywhere was very clean. Rooms were comfortable and facilities good, with a reasonably well equipped gym and two large pool areas, where the attendants were helpful in providing towels and arranging beds. The food was very good however, our experience in the dining room was mixed, mainly because at the weekend, the hotel is open to non-residents, so there were suddenly huge numbers of extra diners for dinner on Saturday and breakfast on Sunday, which turned the experience into a bit of a bun fight. The quality of the food was still good, however the presentation was off putting as staff could not keep up with the volume and serving dishes were left messy and tables were not cleared as quickly as on other days. We ended up in the 'outside area' which felt very 'make shift' - perhaps this area should be made available for non residents so that residents at the hotel do not experience reduced standards at the weekend. On the plus side, there is a quieter residents only pool, so it is possible to escape during the day at the weekend.

"My husband and I are seasoned travellers to Sri Lanka and the Indian sub-continent. We are just finishing a 4 week trip to probably one of the best hotels on the Island if you are looking for a beach holiday. Without exception all the staff are absolutely wonderful - if only we could 'bottle' their smile before returning to the UK? The management readily admit that they need to update the bedrooms and public areas of the hotel but this in no way detracts from the amazing stay you will have from the minute you arrive until the very last minute before you leave. All staff are worthy of mention but as we do not have room to name them all, 3 in particular will ensure your stay remains not just an experience but a long lasting memory (KK Restaurant Manager; Nihal Restaurant Supervisor and Saman (our houseboy for Room 102). The lifeguards at the poolside also deserve a mention; not all guests are easy to deal with but they remain polite and cheerful whatever the guest request! The hotel, originally designed by Geoffrey Bauer has pride of place on a wide, long stretch of sandy and 'sun bed free' beach. Part of me doesn't want to write this review and to share my holiday with you - the only reason being we don't want lots of people to spoil it!!

"So much to say. The rooms were great, try for 3rd floor oceanview. The service was excellent. So many people to thank for our stay Klarathna, thushara, nerosh, varuna.. too many. Most particularly the front desk staff.. we toured sri lanka from Columbo to kandy to Penwalla to Nuwary Eliya to the hikkaduwa/batouna/Galle area. We had reservations with airbnb, and several hotels. When we arrived at the coast area we found none of the houses or hotels were anything like the websites depicted. All were filthy and trash strewn and very small. We came upon Heritance and were stunned . The hotel grounds are lush and clean, the pools were immaculate and the beach was clean large and perfect! There were multiple restaurants and bars on the grounds. There was entertainment . We stayed 4 days three nights and did not regret it. It should be said unless you a very comfortable with local foods and living conditions, this is the only hotel resort that offered a respite from the congestion and sanitary problems you may not be accustomed to. The hotel is also ideally centered between Columbo and Galle . We looked at almost every resort from Botouna to Galle, physically , while scrambling to find a place after being disgusted by our original ""resort"" this is far and away the best, by leaps and bounds . It is a five start resort at economy prices. ( we booked online in the lobby for a significantly reduced rate ) We also did half board which gave us breakfast and dinner. (We found this to be essential and we'll worth the little extra it cost) You will find the food choices were great and varied and the staff would accommodate any and all special requests.

However, our stay there was a disaster! We waited for more than 30 mins to Check in. When we checked it, the room was in a mess and the telephone lines were not working. We complained to the reception and all they said that this was because of the rain and it will come back within 10 mins but it didn't. We tried again but it was useless. The receptionist and the staff were rude and their service was far below the standards. to make things worse, there was a school trip that night and the kids occupied the swimming pool, the restaurant and everywhere in the hotel. The restaurant was expensive and the food was average but the service was a little bit better than anywhere else in the hotel. The room was small but the balcony was nice.

There is very little to do around the hotel unless you have a car or a driver. we found ourselves getting rather bored of it, quite quickly.

"**Google Review for Heritance Ahungalla** Heritance Ahungalla is a stunning resort with a private beach and well-maintained pools. The rooms are neat, and the overall environment is clean and family-friendly. It’s a great place for a vacation with kids. However, the service leaves much to be desired. At check-in, the front desk staff greet you warmly and create an impression of excellent service, but the actual intention to help seems to be lacking. We traveled as two families and requested rooms close to each other. The staff promised to accommodate us the next day, but despite multiple follow-ups, no one informed us why it wasn’t arranged. Additionally, there were several service lapses: - When we reported non-functional TV services, no one responded. - An emergency housekeeping request was ignored until we followed up repeatedly every 30 minutes. - A simple request for bananas for a child after the paid breakfast buffet had closed was also ignored, with staff disappearing without fulfilling the request. While the staff are polite and pleasant in interactions, their inability to provide timely and reliable service is disappointing for a five-star resort. Compared to the service at The Kingsbury Colombo, Heritance Ahungalla falls significantly short. Overall, a beautiful property with potential, but the service experience needs serious improvement to match its five-star rating.",neutral,google review for heritance ahungalla heritance ahungalla is a stunning resort with a private beach and wellmaintained pool the room are neat and the overall environment is clean and familyfriendly it a great place for a vacation with kid however the service leaf much to be desired at checkin the front desk staff greet you warmly and create an impression of excellent service but the actual intention to help seems to be lacking we traveled a two family and requested room close to each other the staff promised to accommodate u the next day but despite multiple followup no one informed u why it wasnt arranged additionally there were several service lapse when we reported nonfunctional tv service no one responded an emergency housekeeping request wa ignored until we followed up repeatedly every minute a simple request for banana for a child after the paid breakfast buffet had closed wa also ignored with staff disappearing without fulfilling the request while the staff are polite and pleasant in interaction their inability to provide timely and reliable service is disappointing for a fivestar resort compared to the service at the kingsbury colombo heritance ahungalla fall significantly short overall a beautiful property with potential but the service experience need serious improvement to match it fivestar rating,1401,217,5.460829493087558,4,0.9445,0.162,0.083,0.755,0.17689393939393938,0.4632034632034631

"A country full of lovely friendly people with happy smiling faces. Their delightfully naive view of life being that if they give something a 5* rating then it must be so. The problem is that prices have gone up to international 5* levels giving rise to the expectation that it will compare to other high graded hotels around the world. This maybe one of a group of Sri Lankan higher quality hotels but no way is it as 5* by INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS. At best it is a low 4*/high 3*. The entrance is spectacular and beautiful but the rest of the property is simply awful. Poor maintenance, unsafe tiles around the pools, under equipped rooms with intermittent electrical supplies and poor drainage. Hawkers on the beach screaming for your attention every time you go anywhere near them.

"We were a group of 20 people in 10 rooms at Heritance Ahungulla for the new year. The service is absolutely the worst I have encountered across Asia. Staff in general are unhelpful and sometimes rude. The breakfast place is fine but the bar and snack place is absolutely terrible. We had to wait for almost an hour for a club sandwich and when asked three times they kept saying “2 minutes”. Finally when I approached a more senior person at the bar, he was totally unapologetic and asked the same waiter who said “yeah, I will get it”.

"We stayed here between 18-24 June 2007 for part of our 3 centre honeymoon and we were amazed by both the country and the hotel. We were greeted by the Duty Manager and a refreshing cold towel and shown to our rooms following a brief introduction to the hotel as well as a choice of cocktail or wine upon ones arrival. One thing to bear in mind from the momnet you arrive in the hotel, is that tipping is a necessity, 100-200 rupees (50p-£1) is adequate and you will find that you tip practically everyone, so make sure you have small denominations of GBP or USD. We stayed in a standard room over looking the pool and the Indian Ocean. The room was exceptionally clean, with a well-stocked mini bar and a tv with various satellite channels. The room boasted a well equipped en-suite, with a huge walk-in shower. The balcony was big with a table and two chairs which were much used when watching the sun set! The room had wooden floors and tiles in the bathroom and there was seating area within the room with a sofa and table. The pool areas were very clean with plenty of sun loungers around. Once you found the sun lounger of your choice a member of staff would bring towels and an umbrella if so required to you. The jacuzzi was not operational all the time, though that is partly due to the lack of clientele, although when it was turned on, there were very few people using it anyway. Periodically, the waiters would bring round refreshing water melon free of charge which was always welcomed. Waiters were also there if you wanted a drink that would then be brought to your sunlounger. Be wary, if you do get a sun lounger facing the sea, you are likely to be bombarded with the locals trying to sell you their goods. A polite shake of the head will move them on as they cause no harm. The hotel have tried to move on the sellers, but they rely on tourism so basically bear with it or move nearer the pool. Although we were half board at this hotel, it was easy to eat in the coffee shop which was excellent value for money and they had a good range of foods. The breakfast were good, with a wide variety which catered for most nationalities, including Sri Lankans themselves who tend to have Pol Sambol (a type of curry) for their breakfast. The evening meal tends to be a buffet, but as the hotel was pretty empty, we had most of our meals from the A La Carte menu which was excellent. On the occasion we did have the buffet, there was a great choice of barbequed meats and freshly cooked meals, all of very high standards. Dress code is smart /casual. The hotel was only 1/3 full as a result of the lack of tourism following the Tsunami and the Civil War, which is such a shame as a lot of staff had to be laid off as a result. The Civil War is taking place to the far North East of Sri Lanka and it was only on the way back to the airport late at night did we ever see army personnel as there are many check points to go through, but don't let this put you off as it doesn't affect you at all. As a result of the low numbers, the evening entertainment was null and void, although as a honeymooning couple, this did not bother us as it was nice to have a walk around or a couple of drinks in the bar before retiring to the room. That being said, the hotel was busy over the weekend and the evening entertainment did pick up. There is nothing about the hotel we would change. The staff are friendly and extremely attentive and they will go out of their way to help you. The hotel in our opinion was worth every penny and would recommend it to anyone. PLEASE don't be put off with the post-Tsunami clear up as we hardly saw any of it taking place, although the hotel is a constant reminder how strong these people are in the face of adversity. The only evidence that you will see in the immediate vicinity of the resort is the boutique on the beach and you can see where the waves ripped the walls apart. Go to the Heritance Ahungalla, it is wonderful and we certainly go back and it is certainly worthy of its 4* reputation.",positive,we stayed here between june for part of our centre honeymoon and we were amazed by both the country and the hotel we were greeted by the duty manager and a refreshing cold towel and shown to our room following a brief introduction to the hotel a well a a choice of cocktail or wine upon one arrival one thing to bear in mind from the momnet you arrive in the hotel is that tipping is a necessity rupee p is adequate and you will find that you tip practically everyone so make sure you have small denomination of gbp or usd we stayed in a standard room over looking the pool and the indian ocean the room wa exceptionally clean with a wellstocked mini bar and a tv with various satellite channel the room boasted a well equipped ensuite with a huge walkin shower the balcony wa big with a table and two chair which were much used when watching the sun set the room had wooden floor and tile in the bathroom and there wa seating area within the room with a sofa and table the pool area were very clean with plenty of sun lounger around once you found the sun lounger of your choice a member of staff would bring towel and an umbrella if so required to you the jacuzzi wa not operational all the time though that is partly due to the lack of clientele although when it wa turned on there were very few people using it anyway periodically the waiter would bring round refreshing water melon free of charge which wa always welcomed waiter were also there if you wanted a drink that would then be brought to your sunlounger be wary if you do get a sun lounger facing the sea you are likely to be bombarded with the local trying to sell you their good a polite shake of the head will move them on a they cause no harm the hotel have tried to move on the seller but they rely on tourism so basically bear with it or move nearer the pool although we were half board at this hotel it wa easy to eat in the coffee shop which wa excellent value for money and they had a good range of food the breakfast were good with a wide variety which catered for most nationality including sri lankans themselves who tend to have pol sambol a type of curry for their breakfast the evening meal tends to be a buffet but a the hotel wa pretty empty we had most of our meal from the a la carte menu which wa excellent on the occasion we did have the buffet there wa a great choice of barbequed meat and freshly cooked meal all of very high standard dress code is smart casual the hotel wa only full a a result of the lack of tourism following the tsunami and the civil war which is such a shame a a lot of staff had to be laid off a a result the civil war is taking place to the far north east of sri lanka and it wa only on the way back to the airport late at night did we ever see army personnel a there are many check point to go through but dont let this put you off a it doesnt affect you at all a a result of the low number the evening entertainment wa null and void although a a honeymooning couple this did not bother u a it wa nice to have a walk around or a couple of drink in the bar before retiring to the room that being said the hotel wa busy over the weekend and the evening entertainment did pick up there is nothing about the hotel we would change the staff are friendly and extremely attentive and they will go out of their way to help you the hotel in our opinion wa worth every penny and would recommend it to anyone please dont be put off with the posttsunami clear up a we hardly saw any of it taking place although the hotel is a constant reminder how strong these people are in the face of adversity the only evidence that you will see in the immediate vicinity of the resort is the boutique on the beach and you can see where the wave ripped the wall apart go to the heritance ahungalla it is wonderful and we certainly go back and it is certainly worthy of it reputation,4032,769,4.244473342002601,6,0.9978,0.134,0.034,0.832,0.20051031746031747,0.5801179894179894

"I returned to Heritance Ahungalla after several years to relive my memories from the last trip which was excellent. This time however the hotel fell way short in meeting my expectations. It all started with a 45 minute waiting time just to get checked in. The lobby was storming with guests and baggage scattered everywhere reminded me of a government hospital than a star class hotel. The room was very clean and neat however, I had booked myself in to a ""Deluxe King"" room with a ""King Size"" bed on the ground floor (printed on the confirmation). However I had been given a room on the 1st floor with two single beds put together. We were so eager to get to the beach that the minute we came to the room we unpacked and stormed off to the beach. It was when we returned we figured out that it was not a king size bed. Called and complained to the concierge and I was told that ""Sir, you have to make a special request for a king size bed at the time of booking if you needed one"". After 15 minutes of arguing and speaking to the duty manager was I offered to be shifted to another room. Again, a very clean and comfortable room but a small shower in a very odd triangular shape. Not for someone who is claustrophobic. We went for dinner in the main restaurant and it was chock-a-block. They had stuffed every available chair and table in to it and we could only move about sideways. The seemed to have a shortage of plates as we had to wait up to 5 minutes sometimes for fresh clean plates. And no service what so ever. There were only five or six waiting staff to serve and we hardly caught a glimpse of them. We were never even offered water. And I am still waiting for the tea I ordered to the table on the second morning of my visit. Dinner was really good. There was a very decent variety of food and the taste was very good. But breakfast was not so exciting. There was no variance and every day it was pretty much the same assortment. In-room dinning was an absolute disaster. It felt as if ""In-room dinning"" is a whole new concept that the hotel staff is yet to hear about. There was no menu available in the room and two cheaply printed A4 sheets stapled together arrived at the door 30 minutes when we called and asked for one. We ordered two fried rice and let me tell you that I have had better fried rice served on a plane. It was a mixture of rice and boiled chicken with the odd piece of carrot. The hotel is beautiful, comfortable and very clean. As long as you lower your exceptions in terms of service, you might have a decent stay. For me however, I do not see myself returning any time soon.",negative,i returned to heritance ahungalla after several year to relive my memory from the last trip which wa excellent this time however the hotel fell way short in meeting my expectation it all started with a minute waiting time just to get checked in the lobby wa storming with guest and baggage scattered everywhere reminded me of a government hospital than a star class hotel the room wa very clean and neat however i had booked myself in to a deluxe king room with a king size bed on the ground floor printed on the confirmation however i had been given a room on the st floor with two single bed put together we were so eager to get to the beach that the minute we came to the room we unpacked and stormed off to the beach it wa when we returned we figured out that it wa not a king size bed called and complained to the concierge and i wa told that sir you have to make a special request for a king size bed at the time of booking if you needed one after minute of arguing and speaking to the duty manager wa i offered to be shifted to another room again a very clean and comfortable room but a small shower in a very odd triangular shape not for someone who is claustrophobic we went for dinner in the main restaurant and it wa chockablock they had stuffed every available chair and table in to it and we could only move about sideways the seemed to have a shortage of plate a we had to wait up to minute sometimes for fresh clean plate and no service what so ever there were only five or six waiting staff to serve and we hardly caught a glimpse of them we were never even offered water and i am still waiting for the tea i ordered to the table on the second morning of my visit dinner wa really good there wa a very decent variety of food and the taste wa very good but breakfast wa not so exciting there wa no variance and every day it wa pretty much the same assortment inroom dinning wa an absolute disaster it felt a if inroom dinning is a whole new concept that the hotel staff is yet to hear about there wa no menu available in the room and two cheaply printed a sheet stapled together arrived at the door minute when we called and asked for one we ordered two fried rice and let me tell you that i have had better fried rice served on a plane it wa a mixture of rice and boiled chicken with the odd piece of carrot the hotel is beautiful comfortable and very clean a long a you lower your exception in term of service you might have a decent stay for me however i do not see myself returning any time soon,2613,499,4.238476953907815,3,0.9628,0.095,0.059,0.846,0.19413677592249026,0.5839347557204698

"Our planned highlight, to the end of our Sri Lankan tour, was a frustrating disappointment. We arrived tired and sick, hoping for a clean comfortable room and some simple food. Even though we had booked and paid 6 months earlier, it took a long time to allocate us a room. The room smelled of mould and mould was easily found in the bathroom. My wife complained, but all the staff could do was find the missing outdoor furniture. At dinner, the first night, we had difficulty finding plain food, that would not aggravate our upset stomachs. The chef kindly offered to prepare mashed potatoes, peas and grilled chicken, for us, the next night. However, the next day, this offer was undone by management, who declared we had been selected for ""Fine dining"". Fearing this was Sringlish for extra spicy, we gave up and went to bed early, without dinned, which we had already paid for. At least at checkout, as some compensation, the hotel did not charge for the sandwich and hamburger, we had at the bar. After my wife presented mouldy toiletries to management, they did offer to change rooms, on the second day; but it was too little too late. The hotel has an impressive entrance and sea view.

"I stayed here for 3 nights with my husband, my one year old and my four year old in August. This is a lovely hotel, well maintained with great staff. Everyone was very helpful and considerate especially as I spent most of my time running after my one year old. The only let down for us was that there wasnt a kids pool - my son could only stand up on the steps of the pool which meant we were constantly on guard. The close proximity of the beach was beautiful so the kids enjoyed the playing in the sand. The buffet was good - there was a different choice every night. For lunch we ate at the pool bar which i enjoyed more. There is a very small kids club room so the kids spent a little time colouring.

"I recently visited Heritance with a group of friends after my wedding in Sri Lanka. We stayed there for 3 nights. The hotel itself was comfortable, with all the necessary amenities. The highlight was definitely the pool, which was great as the monsoon meant swimming in the beach wasn't possible. Another highlight was the quality of food at the dinner buffet which had great variety. The hotel has been there for a number of years and it turns out Aitken Spence (the company which owns the hotel) is opening another large hotel just down the road in the coming months. This may explain the ""tired"" state of Heritance as it seems like there hasn't been a lot of recent investments. Another disappointment was the lack of evening entertainment. Because Ahungalla itself is secluded with very little night life or day time options (compared to Hikkaduwa or Bentota) it was a shame that the night time activities were so limited. The only options we found were a tired lounge bar, and quiet pool side bar. When I compare it to other hotels in Bentota which had more live music and more bars it was disappointing.",neutral,i recently visited heritance with a group of friend after my wedding in sri lanka we stayed there for night the hotel itself wa comfortable with all the necessary amenity the highlight wa definitely the pool which wa great a the monsoon meant swimming in the beach wasnt possible another highlight wa the quality of food at the dinner buffet which had great variety the hotel ha been there for a number of year and it turn out aitken spence the company which owns the hotel is opening another large hotel just down the road in the coming month this may explain the tired state of heritance a it seems like there hasnt been a lot of recent investment another disappointment wa the lack of evening entertainment because ahungalla itself is secluded with very little night life or day time option compared to hikkaduwa or bentota it wa a shame that the night time activity were so limited the only option we found were a tired lounge bar and quiet pool side bar when i compare it to other hotel in bentota which had more live music and more bar it wa disappointing,1109,194,4.721649484536083,1,0.6215,0.117,0.099,0.785,0.034314328348419264,0.5690295815295815

"An awful lot of the people complaining about this hotel are moaning that it 'isn't five star'. As I recall, until fairly recently, a hotel in the UK had to have a Corby Trouser Press in the room to gain that vital fifth star. So maybe people are taking their view of '5 star' from the UK and, if they are then they are probably right - it isn't UK 5 star. But if it was you'd be paying a hell of a lot more than £150/night for it. It is, by any measure a stunning hotel. Cleverly designed by Geoffrey Bawa this low rise hotel (ground floor and two floors above) is laid out to create a series of separate spaces that never seem crowded (they only have just over 100 rooms). The setting, right on the beach, is terrific and the two giant pools are a delight. Those people giving it a poor review also complain that it is 'tired'. It would hardly be surprising given the fight against the elements that must be waged to maintain it but I can't agree. The grounds are imaculate and, yes some of the corridors are showing their age but the spacious rooms are absolutely fine. I've also found the staff to be gracious, charming and attentive. Most Sri Lankans are but here they definitely go the extra kilometre. And you can't fault the food, especially the buffet breakfast which will set you up for the entire day. The buffet supper is also excellent with a cornucopia of choice and a good selection of wines.

We have just returned from our first trip to Sri Lanka. We had a wonderful time and Sri Lanka is stunning. We stayed at the Heritance Ahungalla expecting a little bit more than we got however the biggiest disappointment was how dirty and aged the rooms were. There was no bath and the shower was filthy as was the rest of the room. My son on the first night was sick (not sure how) however we asked that the room be fully cleaned the next day which is was not. You could still see the smears of sick on the floor from where we had cleaned during the night. The bed sheets were also stained and did make you wonder if the sheets were clean stains or not. The corridors to the rooms were also in a poor condition and looked more like the corridors on a run down housing estate (I can say that as I lived on one for 5 years). The bathroom amenities are also just refills with dirty lids so make sure you bring your own! However!! The staff were amazing and so attentive and the natural beauty of Sri Lanka makes it all worth while. Would we go back to the same hotel? No! Would we go back to Sri Lanka? Yes! Yes Yes!

"Recently returned from a two week visit to Sri Lanka, staying mostly at the Heritance Ahungalla. The welcome was warm and friendly, with bags taken to the room quickly and efficiently. The room itself was clean, well decorated, cool and well equipped. We had a family suite, which had a bed big enough for an entire family!! Even though we had an additional single bed in the room, myself and my children shared the comfortable large bed and were very happy for the two weeks. The pools and poolside were cleaned daily. Sunbeds were easily acquired. We were in a group of 17 and found beds together every day we stayed around the pool. The quieter pool was slower for drinks, but ever so relaxing. The beach was breathtakingly beautiful. We weren't hassled at all. The current and waves were very strong during our stay, which meant swimming wasn't advised, however, we jumped and played in the waves which was lots of fun. All of the communal areas were kept clean and tidy. The lunch time menu at the bar was lovely. The chips and burgers were extremely yummy! Having booked on an all inclusive package, we used the one restaurant that was included for breakfast, occasional lunch and dinner every day. By the end of the first week, admittedly, this was a little monotonous. The food didn't vary very much from night to night, even though the chef did try to make it themed. However, the food was delicious and to a very high standard. It would have been nice to have a little more variety on offer though - perhaps in the way of a second restaurant/place to eat. Service for drinks in the restaurant was sporadic. Depending on the waiter, we could wait for around 15-20 minutes for drinks alone. We combatted this by building a rapport with one waiter, who after a few days, looked after us and would bring drinks quickly. The evening entertainment wasn't fantastic. And we found the evening's could drag a little. So be sure to take your own entertainment with you! While staying here, we attended a friends wedding. The wedding planner was very friendly, but failed to explain the traditions that the couple were undergoing in their service, which left them and the group confused. The hair and make up provided by the hotel were sufficient - although our bride did end up taking off the make up, as it was a little too much. The photographer was unobtrusive, yet quite dated in his approach. Even though these may sound quite negative, we couldn't fault the wedding itself, which was incredibly special to the couple and us as guests. The staff were so kind and helpful throughout. Overall, we were so pleased with our stay at the Heritance. All of the staff were happy and helpful. Everything was completed to a high standard. And yes, there were some aspects that could have made it even better, but overall, it's been a holiday of a lifetime.

"We stayed at this place for 4 days 3 nights - US$1,100, included a lame New Year buffet and ""celebration"" (US$125 per person) This hotel bore no resemblance with its sister hotel in the same group Heritance Kandalama (where we stayed over Christmas and which was impressive). The architectual and design elememts that make Heritance Kandalama very special are total lacking in the Heritance Alungalla. The level of service could not compared. The attitude of staff generally was insincere and gear towards tips rather than service. We also had 2 experiences of male staff members making inappropriate comments to the females in our group. The food was uninspiring at best and unhygenically prepared at worst (one of our party and a known other guest were both made ill by poor food preparation.) When the issue was raised on our departure with the most senior staff member made available (only a room division manager), no responsiblity was taken nor apology offered and the stock response was that the guest had not until then made a formal complaint (despite the matter being known to reception and housekeeping staff) and the guest was blamed for not having asked for a hotel doctor at the time. The room we had was an attempt maximizing a corner area and was at first glance impressive. However, not all the electrics were wired up and the basic layout of the location of the light switches was poor (you have to get out of bed to turn off the bed side light). And one of the toilet in the suite smelt which affected our enjoyment of the suite. We couldn't use the sitting area of the suite. To cap it all, having paid US$100 for a vehicle to take us to the airport, the hotel provided a desperately underpower, mini people mover which had no safety belts for passengers (an essential requirement for Sri Lankan roads). Compared to the rest of our experience of accommodation in Sri Lanka, Heritance Alungalla was over-priced and poor value. It is definitely not 5 star accommodation as it claims to be. It just seems to be a money making ""machine"". The main positive point about this hotel is the beach which is beautiful like the rest of the West coast of Sri Lanka (you do have to however put up with beach touts). We will be lodging a formal complaint to the hotel but given their initial response we do not expect any joy.",negative,we stayed at this place for day night u included a lame new year buffet and celebration u per person this hotel bore no resemblance with it sister hotel in the same group heritance kandalama where we stayed over christmas and which wa impressive the architectual and design elememts that make heritance kandalama very special are total lacking in the heritance alungalla the level of service could not compared the attitude of staff generally wa insincere and gear towards tip rather than service we also had experience of male staff member making inappropriate comment to the female in our group the food wa uninspiring at best and unhygenically prepared at worst one of our party and a known other guest were both made ill by poor food preparation when the issue wa raised on our departure with the most senior staff member made available only a room division manager no responsiblity wa taken nor apology offered and the stock response wa that the guest had not until then made a formal complaint despite the matter being known to reception and housekeeping staff and the guest wa blamed for not having asked for a hotel doctor at the time the room we had wa an attempt maximizing a corner area and wa at first glance impressive however not all the electric were wired up and the basic layout of the location of the light switch wa poor you have to get out of bed to turn off the bed side light and one of the toilet in the suite smelt which affected our enjoyment of the suite we couldnt use the sitting area of the suite to cap it all having paid u for a vehicle to take u to the airport the hotel provided a desperately underpower mini people mover which had no safety belt for passenger an essential requirement for sri lankan road compared to the rest of our experience of accommodation in sri lanka heritance alungalla wa overpriced and poor value it is definitely not star accommodation a it claim to be it just seems to be a money making machine the main positive point about this hotel is the beach which is beautiful like the rest of the west coast of sri lanka you do have to however put up with beach tout we will be lodging a formal complaint to the hotel but given their initial response we do not expect any joy,2331,412,4.660194174757281,0,-0.7039,0.056,0.083,0.862,0.09077221797810037,0.527485994397759

"As mentioned above the hotels seems to have changed its profile. The first thing that meets you after the majestic entry, that took my breath away the first time I came, is a large Russian banner. The hotel seems to accommodate huge groups of tourists from this country and many of them behave badly, bringing glass bottles into the pool, (drinking a lot in general) ignoring the personnel, treating the personnel like lesser beings (we saw this several times) and not greeting, making eye contact, or even acknowledging fellow hotel guests. I can understand that the world situation makes this awkward for them, but if you choose to travel out, you should make the effort- not expect to take over a beautiful tropical destination and ignore and cancel all others just by outnumbering them. I will not return to Heritance Ahungalla (the Triton to me) until this has changed. It was very expensive too, which is such a shame when the experience is so negative.

"On our way from Colombo to Galle we stopped by this establishment without prior reservation. The grand driveway and facade of the Heritance Hotel where impressive at first sight. Having arrived there the good impression faded quickly. The room rate given at the reception was US-Dollar 140 per room without breakfast, which is expensive for the island, but we accepted without a written receipt. First of all we had to wait over 1 hour to get the room. By that time the dinner was about to finish, so we were advised to go to the restaurant where a buffet was presented. The quality of the dishes were far from higher standards. The room was alright, but nothing special. The hotel was crowded with tourist groups from China. The next morning by the tome of check-out a bill was presented of 280 US-Dollar. The chef concierge refused to get the man on duty from yesterday night. The outrageous room rate was ompared by us with rates shown on booking sites. The same night rooms had been available from 58 US-Dollar!

"What an experience it’s been at this hotel. I can’t rate it highly enough. We stayed here for six days in January and it was absolutely perfect from start to finish and that’s all down to the staff. If we return to Sri Lanka and this hotel - it won’t be for the bricks and mortar (although it’s great) it will be for the very special people who work here. A special shout out to our room guy Rukmal! I’ve stayed in plenty of hotels around the world but I can’t remember any as being so attentive to detail as Rukmal is. Everyday he makes me smile with the way he has dressed the room with flowers, nice cushions and the towel art is another level… He’s such a warm, happy, hard working guy. Also want to give special mention to two guys have made our trip incredible. Lilanga and Nipun - they have catered for our every wish and whim. We set them a challenge of getting us some vintage champagne so we could celebrate something special and the scoured the whole of the island, rang every hotel and managed to find two bottles of vintage Dom Perignon for us before we left. They really have pulled out all the stops to make our stay so memorable. They made sure all our dining has been spectacular by setting up a gorgeous table on the beach, three nights consecutively. I can’t heap enough praise on them enough. I’m so glad we got to know these guys, and that should be a little tip for other travellers. The hospitality industry has taken a battered since Covid and the staff work so hard by trying to make every guest feel exceptional. I always like to show my appreciation by learning everyone’s name, giving them my time, conversation and a few words of encouragement - it really does go along way and it will make your time here go from great to excellent. You can move mountains with guys like Rukmal, Lilanga and Nipun on your team. They are an absolute credit to the hotel and the Heritance brand should know what assets they have working for them. The hotel is beach fronted large and comfortable. Both pools is absolutely huge and so warm and welcoming. The food has been wonderful and the evenings we have spent on the beach, dining by the waves have been exceptional. But everything is down to the staff here. Worth 10 stars just for them!",positive,what an experience it been at this hotel i cant rate it highly enough we stayed here for six day in january and it wa absolutely perfect from start to finish and thats all down to the staff if we return to sri lanka and this hotel it wont be for the brick and mortar although it great it will be for the very special people who work here a special shout out to our room guy rukmal ive stayed in plenty of hotel around the world but i cant remember any a being so attentive to detail a rukmal is everyday he make me smile with the way he ha dressed the room with flower nice cushion and the towel art is another level he such a warm happy hard working guy also want to give special mention to two guy have made our trip incredible lilanga and nipun they have catered for our every wish and whim we set them a challenge of getting u some vintage champagne so we could celebrate something special and the scoured the whole of the island rang every hotel and managed to find two bottle of vintage dom perignon for u before we left they really have pulled out all the stop to make our stay so memorable they made sure all our dining ha been spectacular by setting up a gorgeous table on the beach three night consecutively i cant heap enough praise on them enough im so glad we got to know these guy and that should be a little tip for other traveller the hospitality industry ha taken a battered since covid and the staff work so hard by trying to make every guest feel exceptional i always like to show my appreciation by learning everyones name giving them my time conversation and a few word of encouragement it really doe go along way and it will make your time here go from great to excellent you can move mountain with guy like rukmal lilanga and nipun on your team they are an absolute credit to the hotel and the heritance brand should know what asset they have working for them the hotel is beach fronted large and comfortable both pool is absolutely huge and so warm and welcoming the food ha been wonderful and the evening we have spent on the beach dining by the wave have been exceptional but everything is down to the staff here worth star just for them,2252,418,4.389952153110048,7,0.9989,0.238,0.011,0.751,0.33423721340388,0.6224603174603175

"For the layabout to do nothing, the fitness fanatic to be at peak, the gourmet to garner all the delights or the holiday maker in search of serenity, there is one place in Sri Lanka all rolled into one. That is the five-star Heritance at Ahungalla, where the blue ocean kisses the sand and the swimming pool stands between the airy reception area. This may sound like a leaf from a flyer or an advertisement. It is not. That’s my experience during a week-long stay at the luxury resort. The absence of what seems an orchestrated hustle and bustle in some of the resorts, being left alone from the taunting touts on the beach and caring of the staff made all the difference. I fell in love with what I saw and what I enjoyed. The buffet meals for breakfast, lunch and dinner had a wide variety to choose from – a cross section of the most popular Sri Lankan cuisine and a widespread selection of western and continental food. That is not to mention the fine dining restaurants. If you need to learn a little more, go beyond what the glossy magazines and flashy advertisements on websites say. I did that. The tins, bottles, corrugated boxes and other degradable items do not go waste. There is a team to sort them to be re-cycled. An award winning Chef, Dimuthi Kumarasinghe finds no space on the walls of his room or his tables to place any more awards including trophies. They are full. Ask him to give you what they call an “indigenous meal.” It’s a three course lunch or dinner with produce including catch of the sea within a radius of five kilometres from the hotel. I told Manager Refhan N. Razeen that I was pampered. “That is our style,” he said. So, if you also want to be pampered in southern Sri Lanka, Heritance is the resort. Don’t believe me.

"We had a very relaxing and enjoyable vacation after spending 4 nights at this 5 star hotel in Ahungalle. We stayed in a luxury room and the rest of our group in 4 other luxury rooms which were all fabulous in their own unique way. All rooms were extremely spacious and we were upgraded to a suite which had a huge living room along with a separate master bedroom equipped with flat screen, DVD player and sound system, a huge bathroom with shower stall, elevated jaccuzzi tub, separate his/hers sinks and a huge wrap around patio with deck chairs. I'll post some pictures to illustrate but please note these were taken just before we left so naturally the room was a bit messy. The hotel has all the amenities for fun with 2 outdoor pools, tennis courts, badminton court and table tennis. The main outdoor pool by the lobby overlooks the ocean and is very picturesque. We particularly enjoyed the other pool which had the shade of a large tree and hence it was never too sunny for a swim. The food was good with seafood at every meal and breakfast was by far the best meal as well as one night with a Sri Lankan fare dinner. Jananjaya a waiter from the main restaurant went out of his way to please and provided the best service I've ever experienced in a buffet setting. Kaushal one of the housekeepers was also very attentive and made lovely animals for our son from towels. Even David P a trainee at the hotel went above and beyond to ensure we had a great stay. Overall from the time we arrived the service was impeccable and probably largely attributed to the very unassuming and nice general manager Upul Peiris who appears to be leading from the front and has clearly set a high bar for the service culture, he mentioned he had previously managed several resorts in the Maldives. The only downside to this hotel is it was designed by a famous Sri Lankan architect who believes in blending in with nature and hence it is not safe for young kids to wonder around alone since the stairways do not have rails, there are ponds all over etc. There is also no separate kids swimming pool. The beach by the hotel is very nice, however, the ocean maybe a little too rough if waves and body surfing are not your thing.",positive,we had a very relaxing and enjoyable vacation after spending night at this star hotel in ahungalle we stayed in a luxury room and the rest of our group in other luxury room which were all fabulous in their own unique way all room were extremely spacious and we were upgraded to a suite which had a huge living room along with a separate master bedroom equipped with flat screen dvd player and sound system a huge bathroom with shower stall elevated jaccuzzi tub separate hishers sink and a huge wrap around patio with deck chair ill post some picture to illustrate but please note these were taken just before we left so naturally the room wa a bit messy the hotel ha all the amenity for fun with outdoor pool tennis court badminton court and table tennis the main outdoor pool by the lobby overlook the ocean and is very picturesque we particularly enjoyed the other pool which had the shade of a large tree and hence it wa never too sunny for a swim the food wa good with seafood at every meal and breakfast wa by far the best meal a well a one night with a sri lankan fare dinner jananjaya a waiter from the main restaurant went out of his way to please and provided the best service ive ever experienced in a buffet setting kaushal one of the housekeeper wa also very attentive and made lovely animal for our son from towel even david p a trainee at the hotel went above and beyond to ensure we had a great stay overall from the time we arrived the service wa impeccable and probably largely attributed to the very unassuming and nice general manager upul peiris who appears to be leading from the front and ha clearly set a high bar for the service culture he mentioned he had previously managed several resort in the maldives the only downside to this hotel is it wa designed by a famous sri lankan architect who belief in blending in with nature and hence it is not safe for young kid to wonder around alone since the stairway do not have rail there are pond all over etc there is also no separate kid swimming pool the beach by the hotel is very nice however the ocean maybe a little too rough if wave and body surfing are not your thing,2215,407,4.444717444717445,4,0.9958,0.161,0.039,0.8,0.2610762876579203,0.5416083576287658

"Just returned from an 11 night stay at Heritance Ahungalla and already making plans to return. Check in was fast and faultless. The room was well appointed, spotless and, considering the amount of guests, quiet too. Efficiently cleaned daily (even the balcony), tea/coffee replaced, evening turn down service, couldn't fault it. Having spent a month travelling,in Sri Lanka, this was by far the best hotel of my trip. Breakfast buffet was something to look forward too with a superb and varied choice. The evening meals had a different theme with a massive array of western and asian dishes, all cooked and presented at a high standard. After a longish stay at a hotel, buffet meals can sometimes become a bit tedious with a longing to eat elsewhere, but despite several beach cafe choices, we were never tempted away from the quality food served at the hotel. Getting tea and coffee could require a bit of patience in the mornings but this is not logged as a complaint just a niggle when you need your early morning caffiene fix. The pools are amongst the best I saw in Sri Lanka, cleaned daily, the grounds kept neat and tidy and the beach vendors kept at bay by security and a respected boundry line although they do become a complete nusiance shouting and calling out to try and sell their goods but after a couple of days they tend to get the hang of who is worth pursuing and who needs to keep having sales tactics applied to. Beach is a beautiful mile plus of fine sand backed by palm trees and suprisingly free of plastic debris; not totally free but judged against standards of some asian beaches and the collection of bags etc that gets washed up, it's a gem. Only problem is that a walk along this beach is punctuated by the attention of several 'best friends' you never knew you had that want to get you to a cafe/gem shop/ tour but a firm 'no thanks' seems to be respected. There is a handy wine shop to the right of the hotel and several little shops that sell most stuff you could need but don't let any of the men that pounce on you the moment you walk through the gate follow you or continue any sort of converstion as they will be clocking a commission at your expense for taking you to the shop. They get the plan and politely telling them to stop, stay here and don't follow me is respected and didn't cause offence. Would I return to this hotel, too right I will.

"Overall, the facilities were nice but we found this property to be poorly managed. 1) Check-in process wasn't organized well. 2 days after check-in, I was contacted and told I had an extra person and I had to pay more money. They didn't even bother understanding their error! We had provided all passports at check-in and we had booked 3 rooms. They had mixed up the adults/kids in the rooms and thought we tried to sneak in an adult at a kid rate. How is that possible if we provided our passports at check-in??? Then at check-out I was still charged and had to get it resolved again. 2) Food was average. And the setup is not optimal. Buffet is split into 2 rooms, with one room having large, open doors which basically let's in bugs/flies. This comes across as unhygienic and dirty. 3) When sitting out by the pool, had to ask 3 times to get towels and ended up getting them ourselves. 4) The room setup isn't good. The bathroom has blinds so it makes it really awkward for someone to use the bathroom. Also, the thermostat directions are on the balcony door (why not next to the thermostat). 5) We arrived on a Wednesday and were excited there would be a show. The show was terrible with what appeared to be some sort of mime type of performance. 6) The gym is a joke! You don't even feel like working out. It's small & cramped with old equipment. 7) There is one elevator that is old and slow.",negative,overall the facility were nice but we found this property to be poorly managed checkin process wasnt organized well day after checkin i wa contacted and told i had an extra person and i had to pay more money they didnt even bother understanding their error we had provided all passport at checkin and we had booked room they had mixed up the adultskids in the room and thought we tried to sneak in an adult at a kid rate how is that possible if we provided our passport at checkin then at checkout i wa still charged and had to get it resolved again food wa average and the setup is not optimal buffet is split into room with one room having large open door which basically let in bugsflies this come across a unhygienic and dirty when sitting out by the pool had to ask time to get towel and ended up getting them ourselves the room setup isnt good the bathroom ha blind so it make it really awkward for someone to use the bathroom also the thermostat direction are on the balcony door why not next to the thermostat we arrived on a wednesday and were excited there would be a show the show wa terrible with what appeared to be some sort of mime type of performance the gym is a joke you dont even feel like working out it small cramped with old equipment there is one elevator that is old and slow,1398,261,4.360153256704981,-3,-0.9522,0.043,0.102,0.855,-0.02312925170068028,0.4965986394557823

"As a well travelled guest, Heritance Ahungalla was one of the worst hotels I have been to. My friends and I arrived at the hotel after a long day, expecting the welcome they advertise. But we were greeted with nothing and yet I noticed the foreign tour group next to us at the hotel were getting a great welcome. The foreign guests were given a welcome drink in front of me and even when j was checking in, nothing was really done. This was extremely disappointing to see as their attention was on the foreign guests, even though the hotels are kept afloat by locals even in times of crisis. In a sense, it felt as if I and my friends were purposefully ignored at the welcome to focus on white people. Next, the rooms were OK and clean with the needed amenities. The pool was ok and the environment was relaxing and calm. But the Jacuzzis are broken and one was unusable. This really dampened the experience. Thirdly, the buffet. The food experience was TERRIBLE. I stayed ful board for 2 days and the food was the same everytime. There was not much variety and so, it was really disappointing. At one point during lunch, I found MOLD in my food!!! The same night during dinner, my friends and I ate carved roast pork and the meat was rotten. It smelled bad and when I ate a bite, it was so rotten and I had to throw it away. The breakfast buffet had some diversity and was enjoyable. The staff is nice and accommodates our wish. The bar makes a really good cocktail called the green pool. Other than that, it was a poor experience. Serving bad food to guests and ignoring local guests to focus only on foreign guests was what made me write this review. I never badly review anyplace I travel to unless its horrible, like ahungalla was. It did not serve a purpose to my business trip either.

"When we i read the inital review for this hotel i read all about eh room that smelt of mold. Well imagine my amusement(not ) after God knows how many hours of travel we arrive....hotel looks lovely...we check in...all good. We get showed to our room - we get showed around and then everyone stands still as the expected tip needs to be handed over. Fine, not great but fine. I then start having an asthma attack, due to the strong smell of mold. Yep I've got the moldy room!!!! We ask to get moved, which was quick and efficient, but i was really annoyed when another tip was expected. At this point i have to say that ws one of my main annoyances about Sri Lanka. of course when you travel to a less fortunate country you expect to tip, but i got out hand. Anyway, hotel was ok...room was nice, good size, bathroom great...Again slight annoyance, they cleaned everyday, but i didn't always think it was that thorough-. The food was fabulous, although we never had the buffet dinner,we ate mainly (when at the hotel) at the 24 h place. the top resturant wasn't open as the hotel wasn't busy enough.Brekafast were wide ranging and very tasty no complaints here. Great gym. which no one uses and it has a fabulous views out to sea- it felt like my own personal gym. The views are great , and the beach is wonderful, never crowded . Once you've told the beach touts that you'll buy something they're pretty good and leave you alone. I'm not sure when they're adding it, but there is no Spa on site, somoen comes in to do massage. I went down the road Eden Hotel & Spa, which i would definitely recommend. Spa is lovely-and they have great food aswell if you want to go for dinner.

"Having spent 8 days braving the roads of Sri Lanka touring their cultural triangle, we arrived at this hotel looking forward to a lovely rest for 7 days and we were not disappointed. This hotel is right on the beach and there is very little around it. It is for this reason that we went half board. A good decision is some respects as there is only one other bar 500 Metres up the beach along with a beach shack. The food at the beach bar was fine and considerably cheaper than the hotel should you be buying on a day to day basis. We often walked to the beach shack at a lunchtime for a beer (300 rupees and considerably larger than that offered by the hotel for 600R). The hotel, in effect has three restaurants. The buffet, the fine dining and the fish restaurant. If you are all inclusive or ½ board you can use the buffet (drinks are extra) but if you choose to use the other two you have to pay. We did not use the fine dining but the food looked good. We did use the fish restaurant on my birthday and it was a pleasant change to the buffet. The surrounding are not particularly appealing, the table and stools not comfortable. Because it was my birthday they had prepared a lovely table for me and provided ‘proper’ chairs making for a much more comfortable experience. The fish was fresh and delicious and went well with the white wine we had ordered. Because Sri Lanka does not produce wine, it is imported and so by locals standards, quite expensive, but no more so that what we pay in the UK. I do feel that the hotel could offer a discount at these two restaurants if you had paid for ½ board or all inclusive but chose not to use the buffet The buffet has a large selection of food on offer and so if you were just using the one hotel for your stay in this country a great way to try the curries that seem to make up the staple diet. (You can even have curry for breakfast). There was considerably more than curry though raging from salads (all cleaned in bottled water), soups to fish and meats. The range of sweets was very good and finished the meal off nicely. My criticism is that perhaps there is too much choice with the main course and as a consequence the food was on the whole not that hot and it was definitely quantity over quality. I cannot say the food was bad, but in my experience it was no more than average. I have certainly eaten a lot better around the world. Breakfast was once again a buffet with a very good selection or hot food and pastries and continental. In my opinion a better experience than the dinner. Turning to the rooms. We were first given a room on the second floor (they use the American system so no ground floor (1)) with a sea view. Number 229. Ok there were some trees in the way so perhaps sea glimpses would be more appropriate, but that did not distract from the fact that we could see and hear it. The room was not that far from the reception but we were told it was a quiet room. It was very ‘tired’ with the decor needing to be updated. At around 9pm we could hear the singer in the bar and also people arriving in reception. The music went onto 11:00 by which time i had been to reception to arrange to move. This was the only major complaint I have as the man on the desk first told me the hotel was full and then looked at his watch as if it was relatively early and made me feel that it was my fault that at 10pm I wanted to get to bed. After not accepting the excuse that it was full they arranged for us to move further along the corridor to the far end of the hotel, well away from the bar and reception the following day. This was in the same design room but one that had been decorated and refurbished. This had been done to a high standard and was very comfortable. We had this for free but they do charge $20 a night for the privilege of having a room that has been refurbished. We were told that the original rooms had not been decorated in 32 years. The room was cleaned daily sheets and towels changed. In the evening housekeeping came round to see if everything is ok and if you needed anything. I think at this point I need to say that all the staff were always friendly, polite and willing to help. Nothing seemed too much effort for them. I cannot praise the staff enough and they certainly make your stay enjoyable. There are two pools, the infinity pool that you see as you arrive at reception, and another in the grounds that whilst not infinity is big enough to swim/cool off and is far less crowded, by far the better choice in my opinion. There are more than enough sun beds, but as at most resorts there are some that insist on putting their towels on the beds that they consider their own for the duration of their stay. If you are prepared to tip the pool attendants, as some did, they will put towels on the beds for you, as they set them up early in the morning If you have a bed by the perimeter you do get hawkers that are in the grounds of the hotel, but stay on the perimeter trying to sell you trousers and sarongs (my wife bought two pairs of trousers at a shop on our travels for 500R whilst the hawkers wanted 2000R for one pair!) I am told that the hotel intend to keep them out of the grounds in the near future. I am aware that this seems a bit negative, not something that I intended as i wanted to give constructive criticism and to make it informative for those considering booking this hotel. I would have no hesitation in booking this hotel. The new rooms are lovely, the ground beautiful (watch out for the little tree squirrels and the small Iguanas) that are lovely to see. Of course in conclusion I reiterate that staff is amongst the best I have encountered and make this hotel what it is.",neutral,having spent day braving the road of sri lanka touring their cultural

"Just came back from two weeks in HA. This is a lovely hotel and we cannot add too much to the previous positive reviews but just would like to share some of the points that we think worth to be mentioned. Location. This is the most important thing that needs to be considered if you plan to choose this hotel. The thing is that it is unexpectedly isolated. Most of the beach side hotels in Sri Lanka (especially such big as HA) have a developed touristic infrastructure just outside their entrance doors - shops, travel agencies, restaurants, etc. HA is not the case. Here you can find only two restaurants on the beach and … that’s all. Needless to say that the prices for everything (from taxi to excursions) are the same or just a bit less than in the hotel. Just as an example we found out that ordering a room service dinner is cheaper than going to the restaurants. So, be prepared. At the same time the good point is that the Beach is just perfect. Because the hotel is so isolated the whole huge shore line is used only by the guests. This is the advantage that cannot be underestimated. Rooms Rooms are Ok. Not bad but nothing special. We were staying in the luxury room on the second floor. All floors have all types of rooms, but the third floor is considered ‘special’ and costs some extra money. We asked for relocation to the third floor but were explained that we needed to pay a difference. As it was written in the other reviews only the third floor had a full sea view. The second and first have it only partial. This does not mean that the view is bad – no, you’ll be overlooking the big (really big) and nice (really nice) pool or picturesque garden with monkeys and varans . Position HA stands rather far away from the main touristic attractions of the central and southern Sri Lanka. If you want to see something you should expect to get up at 5 or 3 a.m. to spend a whole day in the car. The trip from the airport takes around 2.5-4 hours. When you negotiate with taxi it is advisable to make it clear from the very beginning that the price include highway fee. If you do not choose highway be ready to spend 4 hours in the permanent traffic jam on the local road. Conclusion Would I recommend this hotel? Yes, why not. It is well maintained, stylish and relaxing. If you like the beach relaxation, travel with a kid or just want to have a break after exploring the island HA might be a good option. Would I come back? No, next time we’d rather choose some of the hotels on the south closer to Galle.",positive,just came back from two week in ha this is a lovely hotel and we can not add too much to the previous positive review but just would like to share some of the point that we think worth to be mentioned location this is the most important thing that need to be considered if you plan to choose this hotel the thing is that it is unexpectedly isolated most of the beach side hotel in sri lanka especially such big a ha have a developed touristic infrastructure just outside their entrance door shop travel agency restaurant etc ha is not the case here you can find only two restaurant on the beach and thats all needless to say that the price for everything from taxi to excursion are the same or just a bit less than in the hotel just a an example we found out that ordering a roomservice dinner is cheaper than going to the restaurant so be prepared at the same time the good point is that the beach is just perfect because the hotel is so isolated the whole huge shore line is used only by the guest this is the advantage that can not be underestimated room room are ok not bad but nothing special we were staying in the luxury room on the second floor all floor have all type of room but the third floor is considered special and cost some extra money we asked for relocation to the third floor but were explained that we needed to pay a difference a it wa written in the other review only the third floor had a full sea view the second and first have it only partial this doe not mean that the view is bad no youll be overlooking the big really big and nice really nice pool or picturesque garden with monkey and varan position ha stand rather far away from the main touristic attraction of the central and southern sri lanka if you want to see something you should expect to get up at or am to spend a whole day in the car the trip from the airport take around hour when you negotiate with taxi it is advisable to make it clear from the very beginning that the price include highway fee if you do not choose highway be ready to spend hour in the permanent traffic jam on the local road conclusion would i recommend this hotel yes why not it is well maintained stylish and relaxing if you like the beach relaxation travel with a kid or just want to have a break after exploring the island ha might be a good option would i come back no next time wed rather choose some of the hotel on the south closer to galle,2523,474,4.324894514767933,3,0.9976,0.176,0.033,0.79,0.14751968577399607,0.4520254888789371

"When you arrive at this hotel you cannot help but be impressed. There is a large water feature outside reception and a lovely pool just inside. The rooms were pleasant but not great. When I got to the balcony the sea view was not quite what I imagined, the hotel is set a bit further back than it may appear in brochure photos. Found the staff very pleasant and the buffet choices quite expansive. The major disappointment were the cocktails on offer on the all inclusive. A couple off the Arrack based ones were OK but the others were pretty naff. Other AI's I have been to have a better range, although sometimes there is a small charge for the more expensive ones.

"Hotel ambiance itself was very relaxing. The check in process was taking bit of a time, but that was not much of a problem as we had time to lool around the property. I would say that the staff were not too open to help. They mostly replied with a negative sense. The buffet spread was amazing. They have a separate vegetarian corner that is easy to figure out. Nothing to be blamed of the taste.It was amazing. The main pool is a bit too opened to the lobby. The second pool is lovely. The highlight is the warm water jacuzzi that is there near the pool. The rooms were too clustered and badly need refurbishment. In one of the rooms we had the lock was broken. The water pressure in the shower was too much. Lastly I would say that the guests must have their freedom to review the hotel after their stay. I feel it is very wrong to force a review. May be they can suggest to leave a review on tripadvisor, but it is not required for the staff to download it on the guest's phone and wait till the review is posted. If this happens please get a moment off and tell them you will go back and post a review.",neutral,hotel ambiance itself wa very relaxing the check in process wa taking bit of a time but that wa not much of a problem a we had time to lool around the property i would say that the staff were not too open to help they mostly replied with a negative sense the buffet spread wa amazing they have a separate vegetarian corner that is easy to figure out nothing to be blamed of the tasteit wa amazing the main pool is a bit too opened to the lobby the second pool is lovely the highlight is the warm water jacuzzi that is there near the pool the room were too clustered and badly need refurbishment in one of the room we had the lock wa broken the water pressure in the shower wa too much lastly i would say that the guest must have their freedom to review the hotel after their stay i feel it is very wrong to force a review may be they can suggest to leave a review on tripadvisor but it is not required for the staff to download it on the guest phone and wait till the review is posted if this happens please get a moment off and tell them you will go back and post a review,1106,216,4.125,0,0.9603,0.165,0.096,0.739,0.08611111111111115,0.4861111111111111
