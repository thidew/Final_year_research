"Never have we ever been into such as filthy, serivce-lacking beach resort.  The whole premises is a run-down.  The restaurants are not clean: sticky tables covered with juice stains; rotten salad, bread crumbs and fish bones seem to be part of the chairs and cushions.  Serving beverages with cracked cups/glasses which also have dead insects gluing to them.  The food is not well prepared neither fresh, including the seafood!  Annoyed to be served with stale seafood in a beach resot!  Hotel beach is decorated with trash, including broken bottles.  Guests pay 5-star-resort tariff while 1-star serive is provided.",Inspect Room & Maintenance,Upgrade Pool & Activities

"When I walked in the lobby, it was very crowede and noisy, I saw the swimming pool from lobby, it was as crowded as disneyland, I cannot believe this is a 5 star hotel. And the swimming pool was somehow under maintance, can see the view as saw on the website. No bath tub in the bathroom. My flight was 12 noon, so I had an early breakfast at 7:20am, the breakfast time started at 7am, but it was chaos when I walked in the restaurant, staff in the restaurant were chatting, laughing, there's no Professional at all!! I was sooo disappointed at Heritance Ahungalla hotel!!!",Review Menu & Kitchen Quality,Inspect Room & Maintenance
